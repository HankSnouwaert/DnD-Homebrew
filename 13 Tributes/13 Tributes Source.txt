# The 13 Tributes

## #1: Plague Censers

### New Weapon: Plague Censer
These insidious weapons have the appearance of a ceremonial censer used for burning incense, but they are shaped into the form of a flail.  Each day, a plague censor can be filled with toxic incense, and as the censor is swung in combat, it unleashes necrotic fumes deadly to all in the vicinity, including the wielder.    


#### Plague Censer
*melee weapon (martial, flail)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d8
- **Damage Type:** Bludgeoning
- **Properties:** Heavy, two-handed, reach, special
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___

***Plague Censor.*** When you make an attack with a plague censer, it releases its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.  Each creature in that area takes 1d6 necrotic damage, including the wielder.  Once a plague censer releases its putrid incense, it can't do so again until the next round.

The plague censer must be filled every 24 hours with 10gp worth of putrid incense to maintain this trait.


### New Feat: Plague Censer Fanatic
You've learned how to develop a supernatural bond with a plague censor, drawing perverse fortitude from it even as you are withered by its toxic fumes, and you can use this bond as a focus for your magical abilities.   You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with plague censers.

*  As long as you are wielding a plague censer containing putrid incense, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and you can perform the somatic components of spells even when it is occupying both your hands.

* When you cast a spell that has somatic components using your plague censer as your spellcasting focus, you may have it release its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.

* When you release putrid incense from a plague censer you are wielding, you may have it deal 1d8 necrotic damage rather than 1d6.

* When you take necrotic damage from a plague censer you are wielding, you get +2 to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you stop wielding the plague censor in both hands.

## #2: Plague Censer Bearers

These fanatical ratfolk are blessed with the "privilege" of wielding devastating plague censers against their hated foes.  The fact that they suffer from their own censers fumes does not give them pause.  Instead, they revel in it.  

<br>

For it is a great honor to die in bloody service to their holy crusade.  The sacred mission of every plague censer bearer is simply to slaughter as many of their blasphemous foes as they can before they succumb to their own deadly necrotic fumes.

## #4: Night Runners
While most ratfolk are known for <br> employing sneaky, underhanded <br>  tactics, night runners make a career of <br> it.  These skirmishing soldiers fight in <br>  mobile packs that utilize stealth and <br> guerilla tactics to harry their foes.  Once <br> foes look sufficiently weakened and <br> vulnerable, night runners move in for <br> the kill, using a flurry of throwing stars <br> and flashing blades to quickly dispatch <br> their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, <br> night runners serve as light skirmisher <br> infantry who utilize their mobility to <br> harass and disrupt enemies ahead of <br> attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a <br> dangerous task with a low survival rate, <br> ensuring that only the most skilled night <br> runners advance far in their careers.

## #6: Packmasters

Though the many giant rats and other rat <br> monstrosities lurking beneath the world's <br> surface can be devastating weapons when <br> unleashed upon one's enemies, few possess <br> the capabilities to control them reliably <br> enough to do so. Ratfolk have a special <br> affinity for such creatures, and ratfolk <br> packmasters are experts at controlling these <br> monsters and goading them into battle. <br> Packmasters utilize whips to keep their <br> bestial charges in line and to use as a weapon <br> when necessary. With each snap of the whip, <br> their war beasts are driven to heightened <br> levels of aggression. 

Packmasters also use wicked weapons <br> known as things-catchers, which, as the name <br> implies, they use to catch things. These <br> two-handed polearms have a large, tong-like <br> head with the inside of their grips lined with <br> spikes. Packmasters can use these weapons to <br> painfully capture and control creatures at a <br> distance, whether it's a new beast to train or <br> an enemy for their beasts to tear apart.

## #7: Poisoned Wind Globes

#### Poisoned Wind Globes
___
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Poisoned wind globes are orbs made of glass or crystal and filled with deadly gas. When shattered, the spheres release billowing toxic clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 20 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### New Feat: Poisoned Wind Fumigator
You've become a master of crafting and utilizing poisoned wind globes to maximum effect, and you can even implement globes with gases specialized in poisoning creatures normally resistant or immune to such effects. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kits, or glassblower's tools

* You may have the saving throw for a poisoned wind globe you throw become 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, and you may add your Intelligence modifier to the poison damage its gas cloud deals.

* At the end of each long rest, choose a creature type other than construct. Creatures of the chosen creature type don't benefit from resistance or immunity to poison damage from poisoned wind globes you throw unless they are under the effect of the *protection from poison* spell.

* If you are proficient with glassblowers tools and either alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kits, and you have them in hand, you can create a new poisoned wind globe from the remains of one that has shattered within the last hour. To do so, you must expend 25 gp worth of alchemist's supplies or poisons over the course of 1 minute to turn the shattered globe into a new poisoned wind globe.

## #8: Poisoned-Wind <br> Globadiers

This insidious ratfolk infantry specializes in the <br> use of poisoned wind globes. These glass orbs <br> unleash clouds of toxic gas when they shatter, <br> overwhelming groups of foes with choking fumes. <br> A squad of these ratfolk can bring down entire <br> enemy formations with poison gas, and they are <br> especially adept at fumigating foes trapped in <br> enclosed spaces. As such, poisoned-wind <br> globadiers are often used to deal with enemies <br> bunkered within rooms or enclosed fortifications.

Poisoned-wind globadiers wear heavy robes <br> and gas masks made to protect them from their <br> poisons, though in combat, this gear can be <br> damaged, leaving them vulnerable to their own <br> gases. This, combined with the fragility of the <br> poisoned wind globes they carry, makes heavy <br> combat hazardous for these ratfolk, and many a <br> globadier has died to the same gases that slew its <br> foes. As such, most globadiers stay out of the fray, <br> dropping poisoned globes in the path of  pursuers.

## #10: Ratfolk Warlords

Though ratfolk aren’t known for their valor or <br> powers of leadership, those that rise to the top <br> of their martial hierarchy possess an <br> underhanded ferocity that can’t be denied. <br> These warlords combine martial skill, devious <br> tactics, and the ability to rally their otherwise <br> cowardly kin, making them foes that are <br> underestimated all too often. Even when a <br> ratfolk force appears to be routing, one <br> rallying cry from their warlord can turn them <br> from a fleeing army to one that’s quickly <br> overwhelming their overconfident enemies. 

When engaging enemies, ratfolk warlords <br> can utilize an array of weaponry, though brutal <br> spike fists are among their most favored tools. <br> They never fight fair and often use feinting <br> tactics, fleeing from  enemies who appear to have <br> a strong position and striking back at them the <br> moment they show weakness. These strategies <br> also serve to distract and draw out their foes, <br> allowing their minions to surround and swarm <br> the now vulnerable targets.

## #11: Warpstone Tokens

The stone these tokens are made from is pure chaos magic given form. These warpstone tokens radiate eldritch power and those seeking to replenish their magical reserves may be desperate or foolish enough to devour the tokens to absorb this power. Most spellcasters won’t risk utilizing such unstable forms of power, but many ratfolk find the risks to be well worth the reward. Some ratfolk communities even use warpstone tokens as a form of currency, and powerful ratfolk mages hoard them for use in situations where their magical abilities are being pushed to their limits.

#### Warpstone Token
*Wonderous item, rare*

While in possession of one or more warpstone tokens, you can use an action to eat any number of tokens to regain one expended spell slot of your choice. If the expended slot level is higher than the number of tokens eaten, the new slot level is equal to the number of tokens eaten. You must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking an amount of necrotic damage based on the number of tokens eaten on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This damage and hit point maximum reduction can't be reduced or prevented in any way except by succeeding on the saving throw, and it lasts until you finish a long rest.

The amount of necrotic damage taken and DC of the saving throw depend on the number of tokens eaten, as shown in the Warpstone Token Table below.

##### Warpstone Token Table 
| Number of Tokens  | Save DC |  Damage  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  | 13 | 2d6|
|  2  | 14 | 4d6|
|  3  | 16 | 6d6|
|  4  | 17 | 7d6|
|  5  | 19 | 9d6|
|  6  | 22 | 12d6|
|  7  | 23 | 13d6|
|  8  | 24 | 14d6|
|  9  | 27 | 17d6|

## #12: Grey Seers

These eldritch ratfolk are born with grey or <br> white fur and small horns that set them apart <br> from their kin and mark them for a path of <br> arcane greatness. They are trained to be grey <br> seers, the spiritual leaders of ratfolk society <br> who serve as messengers for their verminous <br> god. This position of divine authority allows <br> grey seers to remain somewhat above the <br> petty machinations and power plays of other <br> ratfolk, and even powerful warlords are weary <br> of incurring the ire of a grey seer.

 The favor of the rat god is made <br> evident through the grey seer's devastating <br> magical abilities. Using their ruinous magic, <br> these ratfolk can conjure blasts of elemental <br> magic, summon massive rat tides, or drive <br> their allies into self-destructive battle frenzies. <br> They are also notoriously difficult to pin down <br> in combat, able to scurry just out of reach before <br> unleashing their destructive magic. The <br> protection of the rat god is ever-present, and <br> even those able to make seemingly accurate <br> attacks against a grey seer will often find their <br> strikes suddenly veer off course, or their spells <br> lose potency just as they reach their target.

## #13 Vermin Lords
These demonic rat beings serve as the avatars of their verminous demon lord. They tower above mortals, their twisted forms a mixture of rat, human, and fiendish features. Their heads are topped with mighty horns, and the flesh peels away from their rat-like skulls, revealing bone etched with demonic sigils. Their long, muscular limbs can wield massive weaponry, yet they are dexterous and nimble with their movements, able to dash across the battle and swiftly dismember foes in the blink of an eye. When not taking action, vermin lords are intensely twitchy and prone to pacing about with a rat-like restlessness. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Mortal ratfolk regard vermin lords with a mixture of fear and reverence. They only summon these terrifying demons in the most significant of situations, such as when the machinations of their demon lord are in play. Vermin lords always hold the highest position of authority amongst ratfolk, who show them grudging subservience. As instruments of their demon lord’s will, they serve to guide his mortal pawns and ensure his schemes come to pass.

Vermin lords come in different variants, and the type of demon to step into the mortal world depends on its summoners and the needs of its verminous demon lord.

### Vermin Lord Corrupter

Vermin Lord Corrupter
These pestilent demons represent the virulent diseases unleashed into the world by their demonic rat lord. They are magical maladies shaped into a fiendish rat form, and where ever they roam, they leave plagues in their wake. They are most often summoned by those ratfolk who revel in disease and spreading sickness, and these vermin lords consider it their sacred duty to spread their master’s diseases across the mortal realm.

In combat, vermin lord corrupters unleash a slew of pestilent magics capable of rotting away most foes before they can even reach the demon. Those who attempt to engage it in melee combat will find themselves assaulted by waves of biting parasites whittling away their vitality. The vermin lord will then summon a pair of sickle blades to quickly dispatch its weakened and rotting enemies in short order.

### Vermin Lord Deceiver
These devious demons represent their demonic rat lord's cunning and duplicitous nature. They are shadowy fiends whose size and power belies the stealth and subtlety with which they can move and act, always lurking out of sight until an opportunity presents itself. Vermin lord deceivers are summoned when subtlety and guile are needed rather than conspicuous displays of force, and these cunning fiends manipulate enemy and ally alike to facilitate the schemes of their demon lord. They are most commonly served by assassin clans of ratfolk, and are supreme assassins themselves, able to stalk and slay even the most formidable and well-guarded of targets before disappearing into the shadows.

<br><br>

In combat, vermin lord deceivers utilize stealth and misdirection to attack from unexpected directions and prevent enemies from surrounding them. They prefer to attack from a distance, utilizing a massive throwing star capable of cutting a swath through armored soldiers before flying back into the demon’s claws. When engaging in melee combat, the vermin lord utilizes its deadly warpstiletto, a massive dagger the length of a man and capable of piercing through shield and armor alike.

### Vermin Lord Warbringer

These brutal demons represent their demonic rat lord’s arrogance and ferocity. They are the most common and most warlike of the vermin lords. Their awe-inspiring presence rallies the normally cowardly ratfolk and drives them into battle with bloody-minded ferocity. Warbringers revel in their effect on others, making dramatic entrances whenever possible and striking majestic poses before their followers. 

In battle, vermin lord warbringers will often initially lead from the back, driving their minions into the fray. When it comes time for them to join combat, they wield mighty war glaives capable of cleaving through swaths of enemy soldiers. Should the vermin lord fight a powerful foe, they will utilize a brutal spike-fist capable of inflicting horrendous wounds. These weapons are also useful for delivering underhanded strikes against already overwhelmed enemies. Regardless of the circumstances, when a warbringer slays a foe, it is always sure to do it in the most dramatic and gory way possible, leaving minions struck with awe and foes struck with terror.

### Vermin Lord Warpseer

These scheming demons represent their demonic rat lord’s plotting and manipulative nature. While all vermin lords scheme, warpseers carry out plots within plots within plots. All their actions serve to advance the inscrutable and long reaching schemes of their verminous master, and the world’s mortals are simply the tools through which they achieve their ends. They are most often summoned by other so-called “masterminds” among the ratfolk who serve the demonic rat god and require aid in carrying out his schemes.

Warpseers are aided in their plotting by the scryorbs they carry. These large crystal balls enable them to peer into a myriad of different futures and determine how each potential action can further their schemes. 

<br><br>

In dire circumstances, the warpseer can shatter the scryorb, unleashing all its mind-shattering knowledge at once. Creatures caught in its proximity will have their psyches torn apart as they are overwhelmed by the near-infinite possibilities they are suddenly exposed to.

However, these mighty fiends are rarely pushed to use such measures, for they wield arcane power beyond even their other vermin lord kin. While all vermin lords can channel magic, warpseers alone are capable of calling down bolts of arching lightning, hurling balls of fire, and unleashing earthquakes capable of leveling settlements.

The scry-orb is a magic item, and while the vermin lord holds it, it is under the effects of the *foresight* spell. The scry-orb can be attacked while the vermin lord is holding it. It has AC 16 and 90 hit points and is immune to poison and psychic damage. Attacks against it have disadvantage if they are made from more than 5 feet away.
