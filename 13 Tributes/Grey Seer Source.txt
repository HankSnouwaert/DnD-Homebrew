> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The ratfolk can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The ratfolk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Favor of the Rat God (3/Day).*** If the ratfolk fails a saving throw or an attack roll is made against it and hits, it can roll 3d8 and add or subtract the number from the total roll, possibly changing the outcome.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (3).*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 3 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The ratfolk can benefit from up to 3 allies this way. <br><br>
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Warp Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) lightning damage, and the target canâ€™t take reactions until the start of its next turn.
>
> ***Lightning Strike.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. *Hit:* 28 (8d6) lightning damage.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The ratfolk casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as its spellcasting ability spell (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks):
>
> At will: *guidance*, *mage hand*, *message*, *thaumaturgy*
>
> 2/day each:  *control winds*, *death frenzy (4th level)* *, *fireball*
>
> 1/day each: *chain lightning*, *commune*, *fissure**, *scrying*
>
> ***Vermintide (1/Day).*** Two **rat tides*** appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of the 
ratfolk and remain for 1 hour or until destroyed. Rat tides summoned in this way roll initiative and act on the next available turn. 
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
