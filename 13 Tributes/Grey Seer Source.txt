## Grey Seer

These eldritch ratfolk are born with grey or <br> white fur and small horns that set them apart <br> from their kin and mark them for a path of <br> arcane greatness. They are trained to be grey <br> seers, the spiritual leaders of ratfolk society <br> who serve as messengers for their verminous <br> god. This position of divine authority allows <br> grey seers to remain somewhat above the <br> petty machinations and power plays of other <br> ratfolk, and even powerful warlords are weary <br> of incurring the ire of a grey seer and, by proxy, <br> its rat god.

 The favor of the rat god is made <br> evident through the grey seer's devastating <br> magical abilities. Using their ruinous magic, <br> these ratfolk can conjure blasts of elemental <br> magic, summon massive rat tides, or drive <br> their allies into self-destructive battle frenzies. <br> They are also notoriously difficult to pin down <br> in combat, able to scurry just out of reach before <br> unleashing their destructive magic. The <br> protection of the rat god is ever-present, and <br> even those able to make seemingly accurate <br> attacks against a grey seer will often find their <br> strikes suddenly veer off course, or their spells <br> lose potency just as they reach their target.

#### Death Frenzy
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sharp tooth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You send a creature into a frenzy that pushes its body beyond its limits. Choose a willing creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, it takes 1d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and has advantage on weapon and unarmed strike attack rolls until that turn ends. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Fissure
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S,
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Druid
___

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt out from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long.  The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep.  If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure.  Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side it moves to. 

The fissure deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with it when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the length by 20 feet and its depth by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.
