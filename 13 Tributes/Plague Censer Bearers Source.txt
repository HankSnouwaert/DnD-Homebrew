## Plague Censer Bearers

These fanatical ratfolk are blessed with the "privilege" of wielding devastating plague censers against their hated foes.  The fact that they suffer from their own censers fumes does not give them pause.  Instead, they revel in it.  

<br><br><br>

For it is a great honor to die in bloody service to their holy crusade.  The sacred mission of every plague censer bearer is simply to slaughter as many of their blasphemous foes as they can before they succumb to their own deadly necrotic fumes.

> ___
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The ratfolk can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Dark Devotion.*** The ratfolk has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.
>
> ***Fanatical Fumes*** Plague censers wielded by the ratfolk deal an extra 9 (2d8) necrotic damage with their fumes (included in the attack).
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The ratfolk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (1).*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 1 damage per each ally within 5 feet of the target that isn't incapacitated, up to a maximum of 3 extra damage.
>
> ***Plague Disciple*** When the ratfolk takes necrotic damage from its plague censer, it gains +2 to its AC until the start of its next turn.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The ratfolk makes two attacks, one with its plague censer and one with its bite.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.  If the target is a creature, 
it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the creature is poisoned. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the disease on a success.
>
> ***Plague Censer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.  If this is the first plague censer attack made this turn, all creatures within 10 feet of the ratfolk (including the ratfolk) take 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
