## Throwing Stars

### New Weapon: Throwing Star
These small, sharpened metal stars can be thrown or used as a stabbing weapon to deal small amounts of damage and potentially deliver poisoned attacks.  Their small size and unassuming nature make them ideal concealed weapons.


#### Throwing Star
*ranged weapon (simple)*
___
- **Damage:** 1
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Finesse, light, thrown(20/60), special
- **Cost:** 5 gp
- **Weight:** 1/30 lb
___

***Throwing Star.*** You can use throwing stars to make melee weapon attacks as though they are light melee weapons. However, you still have disadvantage on these attack rolls if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and isn't incapacitated. 



### New Feat: Throwing Star Master
You mastered the art of using the normally unassuming throwing star to disrupt your foes and set up brutal follow-on attacks, granting you the following benefits:  

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with throwing stars.

* You can draw a throwing star as part of the attack you make with it.

* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using a throwing star that did not suffer from disadvantage, you can gain advantage on the next melee weapon attack or unarmed strike you make against that creature this turn.
