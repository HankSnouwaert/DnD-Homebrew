## Warpstone Tokens

The stone these tokens are made from is pure chaos magic given form. These warpstone tokens radiate eldritch power and those seeking to replenish their magical reserves may be desperate or foolish enough to devour the tokens to absorb this power. Most spellcasters wonâ€™t risk utilizing such unstable forms of power, but many ratfolk find the risks to be well worth the reward. Some ratfolk communities even use warpstone tokens as a form of currency, and powerful ratfolk mages hoard them for use in situations where their magical abilities are being pushed to their limits.

#### Warpstone Token
*Wonderous item, rare, 200g*

While in possession of one or more warpstone tokens, you can use an action to eat any number of tokens to regain one expended spell slot of your choice. If the expended slot level is higher than the number of tokens eaten, the new slot level is equal to the number of tokens eaten. You must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking 2d6 necrotic damage per token eaten on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This damage can't be reduced in any way except by succeeding on the saving throw.

The amount of necrotic damage taken and DC of the saving throw depend on the number of tokens eaten, as shown in the Warpstone Token Table below.
