### New Feat: Spike Fist Brutalist
You've mastered the underhanded tactics necessary to brutalize your foes with spike fists, granting you the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with spike fists.

* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with a spike fist attack that had advantage, you can choose to gain advantage on the next spike fist attack you make against that creature this turn.

* When roll with advantage on an attack with a spike fist and the result of both d20s would result in your scoring a critical hit, you deal additional 2d8 piercing damage to the target (not doubled as part of the critical hit).
