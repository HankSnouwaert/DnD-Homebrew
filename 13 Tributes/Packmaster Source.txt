## Packmasters

Though the many giant rats and other rat <br> monstrosities lurking beneath the world's <br> surface can be devastating weapons when <br> unleashed upon one's enemies, few possess <br> the capabilities to control them reliably <br> enough to do so. Ratfolk have a special <br> affinity for such creatures, and ratfolk <br> packmasters are experts at controlling these <br> monsters and goading them into battle. <br> Packmasters utilize whips to keep their <br> bestial charges in line and to use as a weapon <br> when necessary. With each snap of the whip, <br> their war beasts are driven to heightened <br> levels of aggression. 

Packmasters also use wicked weapons <br> known as things-catchers, which, as the name <br> implies, they use to catch things. These <br> two-handed polearms have a large, tong-like <br> head with the inside of their grips lined with <br> spikes. Packmasters can use these weapons to <br> painfully capture and control creatures at a <br> distance, whether it's a new beast to train or <br> an enemy for their beasts to tear apart.

> ___
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The packmaster can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The packmaster has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (1).*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 1 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The ratfolk can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.
>
> ***Pack Leader.*** Any beasts or monstrosities with an Intelligence score of 8 or lower may add +2 to any Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws they make while within 10 feet of the packmaster while it isn't incapacitated. 
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The packmaster makes two attacks, one with its things-catcher and one with its whip.
>
> ***Things-Catcher.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. The target is grappled (escape dc 13) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the pack master can't use the things-catcher on another target.
>
> ***Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. The attack automatically hits if the target is an allied beast or monstrosity with an Intelligence score of 8 or lower. Any charmed or frightened conditions end for that creature, and it can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack. This attack deals an additional 4 (1d8) damage on hit.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the packmaster can see ends its turn, the packmaster can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the packmaster can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
