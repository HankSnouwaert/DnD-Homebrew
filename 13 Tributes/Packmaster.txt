## Packmasters

Though the many giant rats and other rat <br> monstrosities lurking beneath the world's <br> surface can be devastating weapons when <br> unleashed upon one's enemies, few possess <br> the capabilities to control them reliably <br> enough to do so. Ratfolk have a special <br> affinity for such creatures, and ratfolk <br> packmasters are experts at controlling these <br> monsters and goading them into battle. <br> Packmasters utilize whips to keep their <br> bestial charges in line and to use as a weapon <br> when necessary. With each snap of the whip, <br> their war beasts are driven to heightened <br> levels of aggression. 

Packmasters also use wicked weapons <br> known as things-catchers, which, as the name <br> implies, they use to catch things. These <br> two-handed polearms have a large, tong-like <br> head with the inside of their grips lined with <br> spikes. Packmasters can use these weapons to <br> painfully capture and control creatures at a <br> distance, whether it's a new beast to train or <br> an enemy for their beasts to tear apart.

>

>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The packmaster makes two attacks, one with its things-catcher and one with its whip. It can replace a whip attack with a use of its Crack the Whip ability.
>
> ***Things-Catcher.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. The target is grappled (escape dc 13) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the pack master can't use the things-catcher on another target.
>
> ***Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Crack the Whip*** An allied beast or monstrosity with an Intelligence score of 8 or lower within 10 feet of the pack master that the packmaster can see takes 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. Any charmed or frightened conditions end for the creature, and it can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack. This attack deals an additional 4 (1d8) damage on hit. The packmaster must be wielding a whip to use this action.
>
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the packmaster can see ends its turn, the packmaster can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the packmaster can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
