>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The packmaster has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Pack Leader*** Any beasts or monstrosities with an Intelligence score of 8 or lower may add +3 to any Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws they make while within 10 feet of the packmaster while it isn't incapacitated. 
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (1).*** The first time each turn that the packmaster hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 1 damage per each ally within 5 feet of the target that isn't incapacitated, up to a maximum of 3 extra damage.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The packmaster makes two attacks, one with its things-catcher and one with its whip. It can replace a whip attack with a use of its Crack the Whip ability.
>
> ***Things-Catcher.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage. The target is grappled (escape dc 13) if it is a Large or smaller creature. Until this grapple ends, the pack master can't use the things-catcher on another target.
>
> ***Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Crack the Whip*** An allied beast or monstrosity with an Intelligence score of 8 or lower within 10 feet of the pack master that the packmaster can see takes 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage. Any charmed or frightened conditions end for the creature, and it can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack. This attack deals an additional 4 (1d8) damage on hit. The packmaster must be wielding a whip to use this action.
>
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the packmaster can see ends its turn, the packmaster can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the packmaster can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
