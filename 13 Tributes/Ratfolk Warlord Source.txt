## Ratfolk Warlords

Though ratfolk aren’t known for their valor or <br> powers of leadership, those that rise to the top <br> of their martial hierarchy possess an <br> underhanded ferocity that can’t be denied. <br> These warlords combine martial skill, devious <br> tactics, and the ability to rally their otherwise <br> cowardly kin, making them foes that are <br> underestimated all too often. Even when a <br> ratfolk force appears to be routing, one <br> rallying cry from their warlord can turn them <br> from a fleeing army to one that’s quickly <br> overwhelming their overconfident enemies. 

When engaging enemies, ratfolk warlords <br> can utilize an array of weaponry, though brutal <br> spike fists are among their most favored tools. <br> They never fight fair and often use feinting <br> tactics, fleeing from  enemies who appear to have <br> a strong position and striking back at them the <br> moment they show weakness. These strategies <br> also serve to distract and draw out their foes, <br> allowing their minions to surround and swarm <br> the now vulnerable targets.

>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (3).*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 3 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The ratfolk can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.

>

>

>
> ***Warlord's Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Rat Rally.*** The frightened condition caused by the Scurry Away feature ends on each other rat or ratfolk within 120 of the warlord that can see or hear it, and its actions are no longer restricted to the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide actions on its next turn. Ratfolk Warlord can take this action while it is frightened by the Scurry Away feature. 
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
