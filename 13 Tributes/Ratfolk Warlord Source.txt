## Ratfolk Warlords

Though ratfolk aren’t known for their valor or <br> powers of leadership, those that rise to the top <br> of their martial hierarchy possess an <br> underhanded ferocity that can’t be denied. <br> These warlords combine martial skill, devious <br> tactics, and the ability to rally their otherwise <br> cowardly kin, making them foes that are <br> underestimated all too often. Even when a <br> ratfolk force appears to be routing, one <br> rallying cry from their warlord can turn them <br> from a fleeing army to one that’s quickly <br> overwhelming their overconfident enemies. 

When engaging enemies, ratfolk warlords <br> can utilize an array of weaponry, but brutal <br> spike fists are among their most favored tools. <br> They never fight fair and often use fainting <br> tactics, fleeing enemies who appear to have a <br> strong position and striking back at them the <br> moment they show weakness. These strategies <br> also serve to distract and draw out their foes, <br> allowing their minions to surround and swarm <br> the now vulnerable targets.

>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Cornered Fury.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, it may make a bite attack with disadvantage against that creature if it is within range. Whether it makes the attack or not, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
>
> ***Devious Adversary.*** When a creature the ratfolk has been frightened of by its Scurry Away feature since the start of its last turn misses an attack against it, any fear it has of the creature ends. It can then moves up to half its movement speed towards the attacking creature. If this movement brings it within 5 feet of the creature, or if it is already within 5 feet of it, the ratfolk makes a bite attack against it with advantage as part of the reaction.
