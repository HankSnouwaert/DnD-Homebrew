## Night Runners
While most ratfolk are known for <br> employing sneaky, underhanded <br>  tactics, night runners make a career of <br> it.  These skirmishing soldiers fight in <br>  mobile packs that utilize stealth and <br> guerilla tactics to harry their foes.  Once <br> foes look sufficiently weakened and <br> vulnerable, night runners move in for <br> the kill, using a flurry of throwing stars <br> and flashing blades to quickly dispatch <br> their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, <br> night runners serve as light skirmisher <br> infantry who utilize their mobility to <br> harass and disrupt enemies ahead of <br> attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a <br> dangerous task with a low survival rate, <br> ensuring that only the most skilled night <br> runners advance far in their careers.

> ___
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The ratfolk can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The ratfolk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (1).*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 1 damage per each ally within 5 feet of the target that isn't incapacitated, up to a maximum of 3 extra damage.
>
> ***Unarmored Defense*** While the ratfolk is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.
>
> ### Bonus Action
> ***Cunning Action.*** The ratfolk takes the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The ratfolk makes two attacks.
>
> ***Shortsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.
>
> ***Throwing Star.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 piercing damage. If the target is a creature and the attack did not have disadvantage, the next melee weapon attack the ratfolk makes against the target this turn has advantage.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
