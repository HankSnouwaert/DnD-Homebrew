## Poisoned Wind Globes

#### Poisoned Wind Globes
___
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Poisoned wind globes are orbs made of glass or crystal and filled with deadly gas. When shattered, the spheres release billowing toxic clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 20 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t poisoned.

### New Feat: Poisoned Wind Fumigator
You've become a master of crafting and utilizing poisoned wind globes to maximum effect, and you can even implement globes with gases specialized in poisoning creatures normally resistant or immune to such effects. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kits, or glassblower's tools

* You may have the saving throw for a poisoned wind globe you throw become 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, and you may add your Intelligence modifier to the poison damage its gas cloud deals.

* At the end of each long rest, choose a creature type other than construct. Creatures of the chosen creature type don't benefit from resistance or immunity to poison damage from poisoned wind globes you throw unless they are under the effect of the *protection from poison* spell.

* If you are proficient with glassblowers tools and either alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kits, and you have them in hand, you can create a new poisoned wind globe from the remains of one that has shattered within the last hour. To do so, you must expend 25 gp worth of alchemist's supplies or poisons over the course of 1 minute to turn the shattered globe into a new poisoned wind globe.
