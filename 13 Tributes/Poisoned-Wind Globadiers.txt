## Poisoned-Wind <br> Globadiers

This insidious ratfolk infantry specializes in the <br> use of poisoned wind globes. These glass orbs <br> unleash clouds of toxic gas when they shatter, <br> overwhelming groups of foes with choking fumes. <br> A squad of these ratfolk can bring down entire <br> enemy formations with poison gas, and they are <br> especially adept at fumigating foes trapped in <br> enclosed spaces. As such, poisoned-wind <br> globadiers are often used to deal with enemies <br> bunkered within rooms or enclosed fortifications.

Poisoned-wind globadiers wear heavy robes <br> and gas masks made to protect them from their <br> poisons, though in combat, this gear can be <br> damaged, leaving them vulnerable to their own <br> gases. This, combined with the fragility of the <br> poisoned wind globes they carry, makes heavy <br> combat hazardous for these ratfolk, and many a <br> globadier has died to the same gases that slew its <br> foes. As such, most globadiers stay out of the fray, <br> dropping poisoned globes in the path of  pursuers.

> ***Devious Globadier.*** The ratfolk can use its action to throw a poisoned wind globe while frightened by its Scurry Away feature.
>
> ***Fragile Cargo.*** Whenever ratfolk suffers a critical hit or is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters a poisoned wind globe centered on itself.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The ratfolk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (1).*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 1 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The ratfolk can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.
>
> ***Ripped Gear.*** The ratfolk loses immunity to poison damage and poisoned condition when reduced to half hit points or less. This immunity loss lasts until it completes a short or long rest.
> 
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The ratfolk makes two dagger attacks. It can replace one attack with poisoned wind globe throw.
>
> ***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2)
piercing damage.
>
> ***Poisoned Wind Globe.*** The ratfolk throws a poisoned wind globe up to 20 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
>
>When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12 (2d8 + 3) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.
>
>The ratfolk can carry up to 6 poisoned wind globes at once. 
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
