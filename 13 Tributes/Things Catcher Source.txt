## Things Catchers

***Things Catcher.***  A large or smaller creature you hit with a things catcher is automatically grappled by you. Until the grapple ends, you can't attack any other targets with the things catcher. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice), freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. If a creature has multiple attacks with the Attack action, it can replace any number of them with these checks. The grapple also ends if you drop the things catcher.
