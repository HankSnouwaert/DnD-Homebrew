## Lore of Life
This type of magic draws on the power of life, growth, and the natural world. It is most commonly utilized by druids who are able to attune themselves to the cycles of nature and the magical life force that flows through the world. Their magic can direct this flow to heal other living beings. These magic users have a particular kinship with plants, and when directing the flow of life, they can use it to animate and weaponize the plant life around them to deadly effect. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Life often wield.

#### Barkskin (Revised)

*2nd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (A handful of oak bark)
- **Duration:** 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Druid, Ranger

You touch a willing creature who isn't wearing armor, and the target’s skin takes on a rough, bark-like appearance.
The target's base AC becomes 15 + Dex modifier (max 2), and it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage and may do so even if it is only lightly obscured while hiding this way. The spell ends if the target dons armor or if you dismiss the spell as an action.

#### Dwellers Below
*9th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid

Grasping limbs made of vines and branches sprout from the ground in a 30-foot square that is at least 10 feet deep, centered on a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. You can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the spell.

**Grabbing Creatures With The Limbs.** When the limbs first appear, each creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of the spell's origin point must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (its choice) or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 30 feet toward the center of the area and become restrained. 

Subsequently, any creature that ends its turn in the spell's area or ends its turn restrained by the spell must also make this saving throw.

**Being Restrained By The Limbs.** A creature restrained by this spell cannot use teleportation or interplanar travel. If damage from the spell reduces a target to 0 hit points while it is in the difficult terrain, the creature is pulled underground, and its body is destroyed along with everything it is wearing and carrying, leaving no trace except for magic items, which come to the surface after the spell ends. 

Any creature, including the restrained one, can use its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a Strength check against your spell save DC.

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (Water inside a gold-inlaid vial worth at least 400 gp)

You choose a nonmagical plant of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. The plant comes to life at your command, and you may also have the plant grow up to Huge size if it is smaller. The plant uses the Animated Plant stat block while affected. When you cast the spell, you can choose to imbue the plant with one of the following features: Toxic, Grasping, or Smashing, which determines certain traits in its stat block. If the plant drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the plant reverts to its normal form and replants itself in the ground if it is able to.

The plant is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the plant shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.
