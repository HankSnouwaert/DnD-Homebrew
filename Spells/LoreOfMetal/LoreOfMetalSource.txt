## Lore of Metal

This brand of magic specializes in manipulating metals and mechanical objects. It is favored by alchemists, artificers, and those specializing in transmutation magic. Spells from this lore can conjure metal for offensive and defensive purposes, alter the properties of objects to hinder their use, or even transmute creatures into gold. 

#### Commandment of Inertia

*3rd -level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of glue)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Artificer

You touch a construct creature or an object with moving parts that weighs no more than 4,000 pounds and is no larger than a 20-foot cube. 

**Construct.** A construct targeted this way must make a Dexterity saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

**Object.** An object targeted this way becomes jammed, and its internal parts are sealed together. For instance, a chest cannot be opened, a catapult cannot be fired, and a clock will stop turning. (If there is ever any doubt as to how an object will be impeded, imagine what would happen if glue were poured into all the crevices of the object; the spell should have the same effect.)

#### Final Transmutation

*9th -level transmutation*


- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bar of lead)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

You speak a word of power that transforms a creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is petrified, turning to gold until the spell ends. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

**Ending The Effect.** A petrified target can make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell (including the initial failed save), it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed* with the petrified creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

**Damaging A Petrified Creature.** If a petrified creature is physically damaged or broken during this state, it will manifest the same damage upon being reverted to its original form.

**Condition described at end of document*

####  Hunting Hound

*5th -level conjuration*


- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A golden whistle worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Ranger
___

Choose a creature that is familiar to you and that you have seen within the last 30 minutes. You then call forth a mechanical hound, which manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This **hunting hound** uses the stat block below. The hound is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the hound shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

**Detecting The Target.** The hound senses the direction to the chosen creature’s location and can see the creature as if it had truesight, as long as the creature is within 1,000 feet of the hound. If the creature is moving, the hound knows the direction of its movement. The hound cannot locate a creature if it is covered in or wearing wolfsbane.

**The Hound's Behavior.** On its turn, the hound moves towards the chosen creature, avoiding any damaging terrain. If it ends its movement more than 5 feet away from the chosen creature, the hound takes the Dash action, moving towards it. If it is within 5 feet of the chosen creature at the end of its movement, the hound takes the Attack action and attacks it. You can give limited commands to the hound (no action required by you) to slow down, stop, return to you, or continue its normal behavior.

If the hound cannot locate the creature, it returns to you. If the creature is dead, it sits by the creature’s remains and follows them if they are moved.

#### Law of Negation

*2nd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A nugget of fool's gold)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger

Choose one non-wondrous magic item you can see within range. The properties and powers of that magic item are suppressed for the duration of the spell—for example, a +1 longsword functions as a nonmagical longsword. If the item is a potion or other consumable, it does nothing upon being consumed. An item under the effect of this spell still counts as a magic item for the purposes of other spells and abilities, such as the *disintegrate* spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional magic item for each slot level above 2nd. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you may choose one wondrous magic item as one of your targets.

#### Molten Silver

*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A small piece of sliver)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Artificer
___

A line of searing liquid silver up to 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. At the end of the line, the silver spreads out into a 30-foot cone emanating in the direction of the line. Each creature in the line or cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

#### Plague of Rust

*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of gold thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.


***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Searing Shard

*1st -level conjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** S, M (A small piece of sliver)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Artificer

You send a sizzling jagged silver shard from your fingertips flying at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing damage, and the shard embeds in the creature. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it takes 2d8 fire damage if the shard is still embedded.

**Removing The Shard.** A creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the shard. On a success, the shard is removed, and on a failure, the shard is still removed, but the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the piercing, fire, and slashing damage each increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.




#### Transmutation of Lead

*1st -level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of lead)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Artificer

You choose a Medium or Small manufactured metal object that weighs 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. (NOTE: Can you target metal creatures?) The object's weight is increased by up to 10 times your spellcasting ability modifier in pounds.

Additionally, a creature can no longer add its Dexterity modifier to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. If the creature's Strength score is lower than your spell save DC, it has disadvantage on all attacks made with the weapon. If the targeted item is armor, its Strength requirement becomes equal to your spell save DC if it is lower.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional object for each slot level above 1st. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

> ##### New Condition: Obsessed 
> The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:

> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.
