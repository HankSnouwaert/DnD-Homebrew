# Lore of Vermin
There are a wide variety of ratfolk across <br> various fantasy settings, all with their <br> own unique abilities and interpretations <br> of the rat trope.  However, there are <br> many common themes across these <br> varied ratfolk, especially when it <br> comes to the form their magic <br> typically takes.  Many ratfolk utilize magic that <br> plays into their reliance on stealth and cunning. <br>  When this fails, and they are backed into a <br> corner, ratfolk may use magic to drive their <br> allies into a desperate self-destructive frenzy. <br>  They also favor magic that emphasizes their <br> kinship with rats and other verminous <br> creatures.  And in settings where ratfolk <br> are more sinister in nature, they often <br> wield dark magic that helps them bring <br> disease and ruin upon other civilizations.


#### Death Frenzy
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sharp tooth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You send a creature into a frenzy that pushes <br> its body beyond its limits. Choose a willing creature <br> you can see within range. Until the spell ends, it takes <br> 1d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and has advantage on weapon and unarmed strike attack rolls until that turn ends. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Fissure
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S,
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Druid
___

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt out from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long.  The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep.  If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure.  Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side it moves to.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The fissure deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with it when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the length by 20 feet and its depth by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

#### Smoke Shroud
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** S, M (a pitch of ash)
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Ranger
___

A 20-foot-radius sphere of smoke appears centered on yourself, and you may immediately move up to 30 feet. While inside the smoke, you may move through the space of other creatures. If you end your movement inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.   After you end your movement, you may immediately take the hide action as part of this bonus action. The smoke lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.  

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can move an additional 15 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Summon Swarm
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded cage worth at least 300 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You call forth a swarm of tiny creatures that manifest in <br> an unoccupied space you can see within range.  This <br> swarm uses the Swarm Spirit stat block*.  When you cast <br> the spell, choose a type of creature: Bats, Insects, Rats, or Snakes.  The creatures of the swarm resemble the chosen creature, which determines some of its traits in its stat <br> block.  The swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points <br> or when the spell ends.

The swarm is an ally to you and your companions.  In combat, the swarm shares your initiative count, but it <br> takes its turn immediately after yours.  It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don’t issue <br> any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.  Additionally, increase the swarm's size by one category for every two slot levels above 3rd level.

**Stat blocks found later in document*

#### World Sore
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You cause a boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see.  The boil occupies a 5-foot sphere centered on the chosen space.  The surface where a boil appears must be wide enough to accommodate its size.

The boil has AC 10, 20 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to piercing damage.  When reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into puss, and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity save.  Creatures take 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

On each of your turns, while you are within 100 feet of the boil and can see it, you can use your bonus action to either cause the boil to explode, as described above, or grow it.  Growing it increases its radius by 5 feet, increases the damage it deals when it blows up by 1d8, and extends the range of its explosion by 5 feet.  If there is no room for the boil to expand when you attempt to grow it, which includes being blocked by a creature, it remains its current size and explodes instead.  
The boil immediately explodes when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage when the boil explodes increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

> ***Scurry Away.*** When an enemy the swarm can see ends its turn, the swarm can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the swarm can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

> ##### Alternative Swarms
> The names of the swarm stat blocks represent suggested descriptions for the type of animal likely to have the abilities of that stat block.  However, you're free to describe the swarms as being composed of different creatures that might have similar abilities.  For example, the swarm of bats could alternately be described as a swarm of biting locusts.
