## Lore of Change
Spellcasters wielding magic of change favor spells of transformation, trickery, and chaos. While many existing D&D spells can represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this unpredictable style of sorcery into your campaigns.

#### Act of Treason
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Choose one creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While charmed in this way, the creature is overcome by the fires of treachery.

On each of the charmed target’s turns, it must move up to its speed toward a creature you mentally choose, by the safest available route, and use its action to make a melee attack against that creature if it can. If you choose no creature, the target can act normally on its turn.

The target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.

- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation (condition described at end of document).


#### Burning Hands
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 you may increases the cone's size is increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Chaos Bolt (NOTE: There were 2)
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d12 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

| d8  |  Damage Type  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  1  | Acid |
|  2  | Cold|
|  3  | Fire|
|  4  | Force|
|  5  | Lightning|
|  6  | Poison | 
|  7  | Psychic |
|  8  | Thunder |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 60 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d12 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

#### Chaos Storm
*9th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of demon ichor)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
You open a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction.  A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered on a point within range that lasts for the spell's duration.  This sphere is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away.  No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration outside of your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.

#### Gift of Chaos
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A bit of clay)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You unleash the power of chaos to warp a creature’s body. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or suffer a mutation (condition described at end of document).

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the target suffers an additional mutation for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

#### Scorching Stream
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

A line of roaring flame 50 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and you may increases line's length by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.


### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
