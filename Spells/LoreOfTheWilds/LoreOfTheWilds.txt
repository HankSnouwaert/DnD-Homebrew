## Lore of The Wild
This magic taps into the savage and primeval <br> aspects of nature that have plagued humanity <br> since the dawn of time. Some of these spells <br> conjure the most monstrous aspects of the wild, <br> while others undo the thin veneer of civility that <br> separates humans and their "domestic" creatures <br> from barbaric savagery. This magic is often wielded <br> by those who wish to undo civilization and return <br> everything to a  state of primitive barbarism. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore <br> of The Wild often wield.


#### Devolve
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of lizard brain)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Druid, Sorcerer

You choose a creature you can see within range. It must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be overwhelmed by the primal aspects of its psyche for the duration of the spell. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. 

While affected, the creature:
* Has disadvantage on Intelligence and Charisma checks
* Cannot cast or concentrate on spells
* Cannot activate magic items
* Cannot speak or understand any language
* Is treated as a beast with an Intelligence score of 4 when targeted by spells and abilities that normally only target beasts, such as *dominate beast* or *beast bond* (This doesn't change its actual Intelligence score)

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, the affected creature takes 1d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns while under this spell's effects before it makes the saving throw. When cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Mad Rampage

*4th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a stinger)
- **Duration:**  1 minute
- **Classes:**   Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You plunge a willing creature within range that you can see into a frenzied state, making it reckless and heedless of danger. 

For the duration of the spell:
* The creature incurs a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature becomes quickened.
* When the creature hits with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, it deals an additional die of its damage. If the creature moves at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making the attack, the attack deals two additional dice of its damage, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

If the creature is charmed or frightened, these effects are suspended for the duration of this spell.

#### Mystic Signal

*5th-level transmutation (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** self
- **Components:**  V, S, M (A focus worth at <br> least 500 gp, such as a war horn, marble <br> bird, or a gem encrusted jaw bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
___

This spell enables you to broadcast a brief message, no longer than four seconds in length, to each creature within 3 miles of your location. Recipients of the message hear it in their minds and, if they know you, recognize you as the sender. Additionally, they discern your distance and direction at the time of casting. The spell ensures that creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 1 can comprehend the message's meaning. 

A sleeping creature can hear the message and may choose to awaken upon hearing it.

You can tailor the spell to target specific types of creatures only, such as humans, giants, unicorns, etc.

The message cannot be received by any creature if there is any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocking a direct path between you and the creature.

#### Primal Scream
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A goat hair)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Bard
___

You or a willing creature of your choice within range is filled with primal vigor and releases a powerful howling roar in a 30-foot cone. If the target is prone, it can immediately stand up without using any movement. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

Additionally, the creature releasing the roar regains 3d8 hit points. Constructs and undead cannot regain hit points from this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the damage and healing increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Savage Dominion

*7th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Warlock
___

You call forth a formidable creature of your choice: a **Stone Hurling Giant**, a **Madding Jabberwocky**, or a **Hungering Behemoth**. It materializes in an unoccupied space within range and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

This primitive creature is allied with you and your companions. It acts on your initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. You can telepathically communicate with the creature while you are on the same plane, and you are both aware of each other's locations. It follows your telepathic commands without requiring an action from you. If not given any commands, it automatically moves toward and attacks the nearest creature it detects.

If the creature moves more than 100 feet from you, your concentration on the spell is broken. Additionally, at the start of its turn, if the creature has taken damage since its last turn, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn't disappear but becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and you lose control over it. The uncontrolled creature cannot be dismissed by you and will disappear 1 hour after it was summoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the summoned creature gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 7th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, the spell's duration extends to 8 hours.

#### Traitor-Kin

*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a stinger)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You choose a beast, monstrosity, giant, dragon, or fey within range that can see and hear you with an Intelligence score of 7 or lower and instill it with a surge of betrayal, compelling it to attack its allies. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed until the end of your next turn. 

While charmed this way, all attack rolls against it have advantage, it cannot take reactions or bonus actions, and on the creature's next turn, you may dictate another creature for it to attack (no action required). On its turn, the charmed creature must move towards the chosen target by the safest route possible if it is aware of where the chosen creature is, and it must use its Attack action to make all its attacks against the target, which are made with advantage. If it is unaware of the chosen creature's location, it does nothing on its turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Vile Tide
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M  (A few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
___

You cause a swarm of insects to erupt from the ground within a 10-foot square area at a point you choose within range. Each creature standing in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 piercing damage, and insects burrow into the creature, remaining there for the spell's duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage, and the insects do not burrow into it. 

While the insects are burrowed in a creature, the creature has disadvantage on checks, cannot regain hit points, and takes 2d4 piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. 

Any creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the insects from a creature. This check must be done using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, and it causes 1d4 damage of its damage type to the target. On a successful check, all the insects are destroyed, and the spell ends for that creature. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the insects, but if it does, the target takes 3d4 damage instead. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

If the target is a Large or smaller and already grappled by the behemoth, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behemoth, and it takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the behemoth's turns. If the behemoth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
