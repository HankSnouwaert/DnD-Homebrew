## Vampiric Spells
The following spells are often utilized by vampires and other practitioners of dark necromantic magic. Some of them tap into decidedly vampiric powers, such as transforming the user into a flying swarm of blood suckers or draining the life from their victim. Others are more generalized forms of necromantic magic that can conjure or empower the dead. 

#### Carrion Swarm
*5th-level Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

You transform into a swarm of blood-sucking pests until the start of your next turn, along with everything you are wearing and carrying. The spell ends early if you drop to 0 hit points.

While in this form:
* You have a Fly Speed of 60 feet and no other movement speeds. 
* You can enter and occupy the space of other creatures and do not provoke opportunity attacks. 
* You can pass through narrow openings as though you were a Tiny creature, but you treat liquids as solid surfaces.
* You have resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
* You can’t be knocked Prone, Grappled, or Restrained.
* You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. 
* You can’t speak or manipulate objects, and any objects you were carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with.
* You can’t cast spells or make attacks other than those granted by this spell.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

During the turn you cast this spell, you can make up to three melee spell attacks. You can make each attack at any point during your turn against a creature whose space you occupy. On a hit, the target takes 5d4 Necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the Necrotic damage dealt.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 5th.

#### Curse of Ages
*9th-level Enchantment (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an hourglass or pocket watch)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You curse a creature to age at an unnatural rate. Choose one creature within range. Until the spell ends, at the end of each of your turns, if the target is still within 90 feet of you, it must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 Necrotic damage, gains one level of Fatigue*, and ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before dying of old age. If it already has 30 days or fewer remaining in its lifespan, it instead ages 2d4 days. 

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not gain Fatigue or age. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell dies of old age and is reduced to dust.

This spell can’t be ended by *Dispel Magic*. Only *Remove Curse* cast with a 9th-level spell slot or a *Wish* spell can end the spell’s effects, restore the target to its previous age, and remove any Fatigue caused by this spell.

#### Dance of Death
*1st-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

Threads of dark power leap from your fingers to an Undead creature you can see within range. Until the start of your next turn, the target’s Speed increases by 20 feet and it becomes Quickened*.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional Undead creature for each spell slot level above 1st.

**New condition found at end of document*

#### Gale of Souls
*6th-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tear a veil into the realm of the dead at a point you can see within range. A line of howling spectral wind 90 feet long and 10 feet wide erupts from that point in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from the point, following the direction of the line. A creature that ends its turn in the line must repeat the saving throw.

**Changing Direction.** As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from the point. after the direction is changed, each creature currently in the line must immediately make the same saving throw.

\columnbreak

**Moving Through The Wind.** A creature moving closer to the point must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves while within the line. In addition, when a creature moves into or within the line, it takes 2d4 Necrotic damage for every 5 feet it travels.

**Interactions With The Wind.** The winds disperse gas or vapor, and they extinguish flames in the area. The wind is not blocked by walls or other solid surfaces and extends into the Ethereal Plane if cast on the Material Plane.


#### Grasp of Dust
*4th-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Your touch causes flesh to wither and crumble. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier Necrotic damage. If the target has hit points equal to 5 × the spell’s level or fewer after taking this damage, it is reduced to 0 hit points and dies. A creature that dies this way is reduced to dust.

You can make this attack again on each of your turns as an Action.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4th.

#### Rite of the Dead
*1st-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded skull worth at least 50 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

This spell creates an Undead servant. Choose a Medium or Small pile of bones or a corpse within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an Undead creature. The target becomes a **Skeleton Warrior** if you chose bones or a **Shambling Zombie** if you chose a corpse (this determines the stat block used). The Undead becomes inanimate again when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br>

Undead created by this spell are allies to you and your companions. In combat, they share your initiative count, but they take their turns immediately after yours. They obey your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, they take the Dodge action and use their movement to avoid danger.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You animate one additional Undead for every two spell slot levels above 1st. Each Undead must be created from a different corpse or pile of bones. If you cast this spell using a 5th-level or higher spell slot, the casting time becomes 1 Action and the range becomes 60 feet.

#### Unholy Fervor
*2nd-level Necromancy (Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (smelling salts)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

A willing creature you can see within range is imbued with unnatural vigor. It gains temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier for the duration. If the creature hits a target with a weapon attack while it has these temporary hit points, it can choose to expend all of them to deal additional Necrotic damage equal to the number of temporary hit points expended.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2nd.


#### Vampiric Touch (Revised)
*3rd-level Necromancy (Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand siphons life force from others to mend your own wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier Necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the Necrotic damage dealt.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 3rd.

#### Withering Gaze
*4th-level Necromancy (Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fixate on two points within range, no more than 40 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of dark magic erupt from your eyes, rotting anything between the two points. Each creature intersected by the beams’ path must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier Necrotic damage. If both points occupy the same space, creatures at that point have disadvantage on the saving throw.

You can cause up to four Undead creatures of your choice within the area to automatically succeed on the saving throw, taking no damage. Instead, they are infused with unholy power, gaining temporary hit points equal to the total Necrotic damage dealt by the spell. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4th.

> ##### New Condition: Fatigue
> The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.
> 
> **Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.
> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue. 

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.
