___


A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. A creature moving through the area (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) must make a Strength saving throw or spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves the area until the start of its next turn. The area is heavily obscured for creatures other than you. Ranged weapon attacks in the area are impossible unless you allow them, and the wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on spells. Gusts of  wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical.

You may choose one of the following additional effects to occur until the start of your next turn. At the start of each of your turns, you can choose a new effect that you have not chosen yet.


|  |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|    | You call 6 bolts of lightning from the cloud to strike 6 creatures or objects of your choice beneath it. A given creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 10d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful on. |
|    | Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. |
|    | Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and object under the cloud takes 3d4 acid damage. |
|   | Thunder booms in the area.  Each creature under the cloud must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes deafened for 1 minute and is stunned until the end of your next turn. |

- **Duration:** Up to 1 minute
- **Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

 When you cast this spell, and as an action on each of your turns for its duration, you can make a ranged spell attack that targets one creature within range.

On each of your turns for the duration, you can use an action to automatically deal 1d10 lightning damage to one target with which you have an arc. The arc ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything other than attack or deal damage using this spell or if you are incapacitated.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage and automatic damage increase by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.
