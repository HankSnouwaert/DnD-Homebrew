## Lore of Stealth


#### Black Whirlwind
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a moth wing)
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:** Druid, Wizard, Warlock
___

You cause a whirlwind of vile smoke and stinging ashes to rush up at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 20-foot radius of that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and loses any darkvision it has until the end of its next turn. On a successful save,  a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its darkvision.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. The spell also snuffs out any non-magical fire in its area.


***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Brittle Bones
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a broken twig)

___

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become brittle for the duration. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Creeping Strike

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V S
- **Duration:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You lash out at an enemy with chilling shadows. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is in darkness. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d12 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

You startle a creature you can see within range with a screech that rips into its mind. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d8 psychic damage. If it is surprised, it has disadvantage on the saving throw, and if it can't see you, it instead takes 1d12 psychic damage.

Creatures immune to fear automatically succeed on this save.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell’s damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

___

A 20-foot-radius sphere of smoke appears centered on yourself, and you may immediately move up to 30 feet. The area within the smoke is heavily obscured. While inside the smoke, you may move through the space of other creatures. If you end your movement inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.   After you end your movement, you may immediately take the hide action as part of this bonus action. The smoke lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.  

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can move an additional 15 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Toxic Coating

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:** Artificer, Druid, Ranger
___
You touch a weapon, piece of ammunition, or component of a mechanical trap, which becomes coated with venom. The next time the coated object deals piercing or slashing damage to a creature during the spell’s duration, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned this way can repeat the Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the poison damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
