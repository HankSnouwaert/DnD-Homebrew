You conjure a chain that bursts from the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range.  The chain immediately lashes out at a creature of your choice within 30 feet of its origin point that you can see.  That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be bound to the chain.

While the creature is bound to the chain, it must make a Strength check against your spell save DC if it attempts to move more than 30 feet away from the chain's origin point; if it succeeds on this check, it breaks free of the chain.

Until the spell ends, you can use your bonus action to direct the chain to lash out at a creature within 30 feet of its origin point that you can see, attempting to bind it as described above.  You can only have one creature bound with any given chain at a time. 

The chain has AC 15 and 20 hit points.  When it is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

You throw back your head and emit an ululating scream.  Each creature within range takes 4d4 thunder damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d4 additional psychic damage and be deafened for 1 minute.

___
You open a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction.  A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered on a point within range that lasts for the spell's duration.  This sphere is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away.  No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting a point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration without your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.

While entombed this way, it gains 40 temporary hit points, is incapacitated, and has resistance to all damage except fire and thunder damage. 

The air within 15 feet of the entombed creature is chilled.

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

On a failed save, the sphere strikes the target and explodes.  When the sphere explodes, each creature within a 20-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d8 fire damage.  Creatures who pass their save take half as much damage, and a creature hit by the sphere fails the save automatically.

A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.
 
On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the spell, or it ends. It also ends if you are incapacitated. You can end the spell at any time.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Summon Swarm (Public)
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded cage worth at least 300 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You call forth a swarm of tiny creatures that manifest in <br> an unoccupied space you can see within range.  This <br> swarm uses the Swarm Spirit stat block*.  When you cast <br> the spell, choose a type of creature: Bats, Insects, Rats, or Snakes.  The creatures of the swarm resemble the chosen creature, which determines some of its traits in its stat <br> block.  The swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points <br> or when the spell ends.

The swarm is an ally to you and your companions.  In combat, the swarm shares your initiative count, but it <br> takes its turn immediately after yours.  It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don’t issue <br> any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.  Additionally, increase the swarm's size by one category for every two slot levels above 3rd level.

This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

___

You begin to build up intense heat, debilitating those around you. Each creature within 15 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws until the end of your next turn. On your next turn, you may use your bonus action to release the heat you've built up. If you do so, each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d6 fire damage on a failure and half as much on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Tranquility

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:** Druid
___
Healing rains wash down around you in a 20-foot radius centered on yourself.  At the end of each of your turns, creatures of your choice within the rain receive its healing.  Each creature healed this way regains hit points equal to 2d4 + your spell casting modifier.  The rains remain centered on the location where you cast the spell until the spell ends.  

The rains can grant healing a number of times equal to 3 plus your spell casting modifier (minimum 4 times).  After granting healing that number of times, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing received increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Water Whip
*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a water skin filled with water)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid

You summon a tendril of water to strike at a creature you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 bludgeoning damage and must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can either knock it prone or pull it up to 25 feet closer to you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

\columnbreak

#### World Sore (Public)
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You cause a boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see.  The boil occupies a 5-foot sphere centered on the chosen space.  The surface where a boil appears must be wide enough to accommodate its size.

The boil has AC 10, 20 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to piercing damage.  When reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into puss, and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity save.  Creatures take 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

On each of your turns, while you are within 100 feet of the boil and can see it, you can use your bonus action to either cause the boil to explode, as described above, or grow it.  Growing it increases its radius by 5 feet, increases the damage it deals when it blows up by 1d8, and extends the range of its explosion by 5 feet.  If there is no room for the boil to expand when you attempt to grow it, which includes being blocked by a creature, it remains its current size and explodes instead.  
The boil immediately explodes when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage when the boil explodes increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
