## Lore of The Crones
This ancient magic of the old world is utilized by the mystic crones who've safeguarded the lore and passed it down through the generations. It taps into the darker forces of nature, which can curse and undo enemies while aiding allies. Wielders of this magic can conjure concoctions that burn enemies and heal allies, summon groves that hinder foes and protect friends, and deal out blessings and curses as they see fit. While the crones have kept the knowledge of spells to themselves, understanding of their use has crept out across the world, and they are sometimes utilized by other spellcasters who've delved into the dark lore of the old world.


#### Bountiful Cauldron
*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a Medium cauldron in an unoccupied space on the ground that you can see within 30 feet. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds, has 90 hit points, AC equal to your spell save DC, and is immune to Acid, Poison, and Psychic damage.

The cauldron has 5 charges and disappears when the spell ends, when it has no charges remaining, or when it is reduced to 0 hit points.

When the cauldron appears, and as a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns, you can expend 1 charge to have the cauldron launch a potent concoction at one or two creatures you can see within 30 feet of it.

 If you choose two creatures, they are both subjected to the same effect, chosen from the following options:

**Broth.** Each target gains 6d6 temporary hit points, which last for 1 minute.

**Brew.** Each target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 6d6 Acid damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much.

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> The creature is consumed by bloodlust, giving it the following effects:
> * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear. 
> * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.



> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default assumption described here is fire, but it could be another source that deals a different type of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.



> ##### Notes on 2024 Burning Rules
> If you're using the rules for burning described in the 2024 edition of D&D, these are the changes that were made in this document:
> * **Sources of Burning Don't Stack.** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
> * **Damage At End of Turn.** Burning damage occurs at the end of a creature's turn rather than the beginning. This gives the creature the chance to try to end the condition before taking the damage, thus giving players more agency when they start burning.
