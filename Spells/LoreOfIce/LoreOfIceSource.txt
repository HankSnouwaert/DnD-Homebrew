## Lore of Ice
This brand of magic draws on the powers of the frigid <br> north and winter itself. Those who practice it often dwell <br> in tundra locals, but others may revere winter and its solstice. Still, others may simply be elemental enthusiasts looking to compliment their magical arsenal with some freezing spells. Most of these spells conjure icey phenomena or unleash blasts of freezing magic capable of encasing targets in ice. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Ice often wield.

#### Deathly Frost
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard.

You cause a creature to be gripped by freezing cold. Until the spell ends, at the end of each of your turns, if the target is within 90 feet of you, it must make Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way. Any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away after the spell ends.

#### Frost Blade
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer

You invoke a sword of sharp ice in your hand or that of another willing creature you can see within range that has a free hand. This magic sword lasts until the spell ends. 

**The Blade's Properties.** It counts as a magical, simple melee weapon with which you and any number of creatures of your choice upon casting the spell are proficient with. It deals 2d10 slashing damage on hit and has the finesse, versatile (2d12), and thrown (range 60/90) properties. 

**Throwing The Blade.** When a creature uses the sword to make a thrown attack, hit or miss, the weapon explodes, and the spell ends. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may create an additional sword for every two levels above 3rd level.

#### Frost Nova
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of water <br> or piece of ice)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You cause a ring of ice and frost to burst out <br> from you to a radius of up to a 15-feet. Each <br> creature other than you in that area must make <br> a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a <br> creature takes 2d10 cold damage, and until the <br> end of your next turn, its speed is reduced by <br> 20 feet, and it has disadvantage on weapon <br> attack rolls. On a successful save, a creature <br> takes half as much damage and suffers no <br> other effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell <br> using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, both the <br> damage increases by 1d10, and the maximum <br> possible radius increases by 5 feet for each slot <br> level above 3rd.


#### Ice Sheet 
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a drop of water or piece of ice)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid
___

A wave of cold 30 feet long and 15 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. The ground in the area is covered with ice, turning it into difficult terrain for the duration. Any surface of a body of water or a liquid that is principally water-based within the area freezes to a depth of 6 inches for the duration. Creatures may move across the frozen surfaces as if they are difficult terrain. 

**Destroying The Ice.** A 5-foot square area of ice can be destroyed by attacking it (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). 

**Slipping On The Ice.** When the ice appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. 

**Being Caught In The Water.** If a creature is swimming in an area where ice appears, it must make a Strength saving throw instead or become restrained by ice for the duration. A creature restrained by the ice or another creature that can reach it can also use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed. The target is also freed if any ice where at its location is destroyed. On a successful save, the creature can move below or above the now frozen surface.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the length of the line increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Icy Tomb
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature you can see within range would take damage or make a death saving throw.
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Ice encases one willing Medium or smaller creature you can see within range. It is trapped inside a Medium-sized ice block object that occupies its space for the duration of the spell or until the ice is reduced to 0 hit points. The ice has an AC equal to your spell save; HP 50; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). A creature trapped inside the ice is blinded, restrained, incapacitated, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ice, and becomes stable if it is at 0 hit points.

**Casting It As An Action.** You can choose to cast this spell as an action on your turn, choosing any creature within range. If the creature is not willing, it may make a Strength saving throw; on success, the spell ends and has no effect on the creature.

**Damaging The Ice From Within.** A creature inside the ice can choose to deal bludgeoning damage to the ice equal to 1d6 + its Strength modifier at the end of each of its turns.

**Casting It On Yourself.** If you cast the spell on yourself, it does not require Concentration, and you can choose to end the spell at the start of your turn. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the ice block gains 10 additional Hit Points for each slot level above 5th.

#### Soul of Winter
*9th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (sapphire worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

A 30-foot-radius sphere of whirling sub-zero cold springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. 

**Creatures In the Sphere When It's First Cast.** Each creature in the sphere, when it first appears, must succeed on a Strength saving. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 cold damage and is restrained by ice for 1 minute. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

**Icy Surfaces.** The surfaces within the sphere are coated in ice, making any ground in the area difficult terrain for one minute. The first time each turn that a creature either moves into or out of any difficult terrain created by the spell, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. 

**Creatures Ending Their Turn In The Sphere.** Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way.

**The Spell's End.** When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the ice in the sphere shatters in an explosion. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes piercing damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on <br> a successful one. The spell's base damage is 2d8. <br> At the end of each of your subsequent turns after <br> the spell has been cast, if the sphere has not yet <br> exploded, the damage increases by 2d8.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 40-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. 

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, while restrained this way, the target takes 2d6 cold damage. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage and the damage at the end of the restrained target's turn are increased by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
