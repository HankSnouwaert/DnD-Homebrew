# Lore of Decay
Within the Warhammer world, the daemon god Nurgle represents disease, decay, and entropy, and there is an entire school of spells devoted to his magic. While many existing D&D spells can represent Nurgle's magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing his putrescent style of sorcery into your campaigns.

####  Inflict Rot
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock
___

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 necrotic damage and is afflicted with a disease that lasts until the spell ends. 

A creature afflicted by this disease takes 3d10 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and must make a Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. 

If a diseased creature drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can end the disease on the creature and cause it to unleash a wave of rot. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. You may choose to have one of the creatures that failed the saving throw become infected with the same disease.

#### Miasma of Pestilence
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V S M (A bit of durian fruit)
- **Duration:** Concentration, Up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A cloud of putrescent vapor appears in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a moderate wind (at least 5 miles per hour) disperses it after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Each creature completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.

#### Puddle of Ooze 
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of slug slime)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Artificer
___

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range is covered in acidic ooze, becoming difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 1d4 acid damage for every 5 feet it travels.

When the ooze appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage.

#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.


***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the necrotic damage dealt to targeted creatures and by the cone of bile by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
