## Lore of Fel Dwarves
This fiendish magic was developed by the devil-worshipping fel dwarves and embodies their ability to dominate not only the will of others but the very earth itself. Many of their spells conjure a brutal mix of fire and earth, incinerating or crushing foes with molten rock. Other spells twist the will of others, instilling deep hatred or fear and subservience. While these spells are most commonly used by fel dwarves, other fiendish spell casters or those with close ties to fire and earth may wield this magic as well.

#### Ash Storm

*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of soot)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You unleash a wave of scalding ash in a 60-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line originating from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 fire damage, is pushed 15 feet away form you, and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d10 and for each slot level above 4th.

#### Breath of Hatred
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Warlock

Your breath fills a creature with obsessive malice. Choose one creature within range. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (it may choose to fail), or it becomes obsessed* with another creature of your choice within range that is hostile to the target. While obsessed, the target has advantage on attack rolls against the chosen creature.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it did not take an action during the turn or the source of its obsession is not within line of sight, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature to become obsessed with the same creature for every two slot levels above 1st.

#### Curse of Stone

*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You attempt to transform one creature that you can see within range into stone. If the target’s body is made of flesh, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified until the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for ever two slots levels above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Divine Hammer
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range and a direction. A giant hammer manifests and slams the ground at the chosen point, impacting everything in a 10-foot cube centered on the point. It then sends a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-wide shockwave in the chosen direction before disappearing.

Each creature in the area of the hammer’s impact or shockwave must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 fire or lighting damage (your choice) and 5d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone; it is also dazed* until the end of its next turn if it is in the area of the impact. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or dazed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the fire or lighting damage and the thunder damage each increase by 1d6 for every slot level above 6th.


#### Elemental Bane (Revised)

*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 90
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Druid, Warlock, Wizard, Artificer

Choose one creature you can see within range and one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, the target loses any resistance to the chosen damage type, and immunity to the damage type is treated as resistance instead. Additionally, the first time each turn the target takes damage of the chosen type, it takes an extra 1d6 damage of that type.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

> #####  Divine Hammer Damage Types
> Depending on the nature of the god the spellcaster worships, it may make more sense for the divine hammer to do damage of a type other than fire or lighting; for example, some gods may be more associated with radiant or necrotic. At the DM's discretion, the damage can be changed this way, in which case the spellcaster should no longer have the option for fire or lighting.

<br>

#### Eruption
*8th-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Wizard, Sorcerer

You choose a point you can see on the ground within range. The ground cracks and a burst of magma erupts in a 60-foot-radius, 120-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature in the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d12 fire damage and 4d12 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

Additionally, the ground in the area becomes superheated for 1 minute. The area becomes difficult terrain, and any creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d12 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save.

After the area cools down, it remains difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

#### Hellfire Weapon
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 20 ft
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Warlock

You conjure a weapon made of hungering fire and hurl or strike with it. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range, or a melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage. If you score a critical hit or reduce a creature to 0 hit points with this attack, you can cast this spell again as a bonus action on this turn. After the attack is made, the weapon vanishes.

The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach certain levels: 2d8 at 5th level, 3d8 at 11th level, and 4d8 at 17th level.

#### Magmatic Stone
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of igneous rock)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

You conjure a molten rock and hurl it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage. Whether the attack hits or misses, the rock explodes on impact, creating a 15-foot-radius sphere of whirling magma centered on the point of impact. The sphere lasts for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The sphere spreads around corners and seeps through openings at least 5 feet in diameter.

When the sphere first appears, and at the start of each of your turns thereafter, it moves 10 feet in the direction you hurled it from. Any creature whose space the sphere enters or passes through must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bludgeoning and fire damage both increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

> ##### New Condition: Obsessed 
> The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the  *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.


#### Subjugation
*2th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You attempt to crush the will of one creature you can see within range. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the spell ends. While frightened in this way, the target is also charmed by you.

The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
