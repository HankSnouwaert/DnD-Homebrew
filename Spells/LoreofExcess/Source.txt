## Lore of Excess
Spellcasters wielding magic of excess <br> favor spells that induce indulgence, pain, <br> pleasure, some perverse combination of <br> all three. While many existing D&D spells <br> can represent this magic, the following <br> new spells provide even more ways of <br> bringing this profane style of sorcery into <br> your campaigns.


#### Acquiescence
*2rd-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** range 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of fine sand, <br>rose petals, or a cricket)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

Choose one creature you can see within range. The <br> target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or <br> become Drowsy* for the duration. At the end of each <br> of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, <br> ending the effect on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when targeted. (NOTE: Do they need to be within this range of each other?)

#### Cacophonic Call
*7th-level Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:**   1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You unleash an ululating scream that radiates from you in a 30-foot radius. The scream can be heard up to 1,000 feet away. Each creature of your choice in the area must make a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (its choice).

**Successful Constitution Save.** The creature takes 4d8 Psychic damage and is Frightened of you until the start of your next turn. While Frightened in this way, it can only cast spells of 1st level or lower.

**Successful Wisdom Save.** The creature takes 4d8 Thunder damage and is Dazed* until the start of your next turn.

**Failed Save (Either Type).** The creature suffers both of the above effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the thunder and Psychic damage is increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.

<br>

**New condition described at end of document*

#### Chaotic Pavane
*3rd-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:**  30 feet
- **Components:** V S M (a bit of catgut)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

Each creature in a 15-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected for the duration.

On a failed save, the creature begins a painful, involuntary dance. While dancing, the creature:

* Can't take reactions or bonus actions.
* Must stand up if Prone, spending 5 feet of movement to do so.
* Must take the Dodge action.
* Must immediately use all its movement in a random direction. Roll 1d4 to determine the direction: 1—north, 2—east, 3—south, 4—west.

At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If it did not move during its turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the creature falls Prone and the effect ends for it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The affected creature takes 1d10 Bludgeoning damage whenever it moves due to the spell. This damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Hysterical Frenzy 
*5th-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** range 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You unleash a torrent of overwhelming emotion—blending agony and euphoria into a maddening storm. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw (a creature can choose to fail).

On a failed save, a creature is affected by the Rampaging* condition for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. The creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if it damaged another creature with an attack during that turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The sphere’s radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.

#### Phantasmagoria
*5th-level Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Warlock
___

You conjure haunting illusions—phantom creatures that swirl and whisper within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. The illusions whisper dark promises and unsettling truths that cloud the minds of your foes.

When you cast the spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. Affected creatures in the area have disadvantage on Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration.

The spell ends early if you move more than 60 feet away from the point where it was cast.

#### Power Word: Pain (Revised)
*7th-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You speak a word of power that wracks a creature you can see within range with excruciating pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it has 100 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails.

\columnbreak

* On a failed save, the target suffers Crippling Pain.
* On a successful save, it suffers Mild Pain instead.

**Crippling Pain.** A creature suffering from Crippling Pain is affected as follows:

* Its speed cannot exceed 15 feet.
* It has disadvantage on all d20 tests not caused by this spell.
* When it attempts to cast a spell, it must first make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If the spell required a slot or resource, that resource is not expended.
* Each time it takes a move, action, bonus action, or reaction, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage. This damage cannot reduce the target's hit points below 1.

**Mild Pain.** A creature suffering from mild pain takes 2d8 Necrotic damage whenever it takes a move, action, bonus action, or reaction. This damage cannot reduce the target's hit points below 1.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature suffering from either type of pain can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

#### Power Word: Stun (Revised)
*8th-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You speak a word of power that overwhelms the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails.

* On a failed save, the creature is Stunned.
* On a successful save, the creature is Dazed*.

A creature Stunned or Dazed by this spell can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### Slashing Shards
*4th-level  Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of broken glass)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a cloud of razor-sharp glass and launch it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 Slashing damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an additional 6d6 Psychic damage, or half as much on a successful one.

If the attack misses, the shards still graze the target, which takes half the Slashing damage and suffers no additional effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the Slashing and Psychic damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Vicious Lash 
*1st-level Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Bard, Warlock
___
You conjure a whip of raw torment and lash it in a 5-foot-wide line extending from you to a creature within range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 Thunder damage.

Hit or miss, the target and each creature in the line between you and it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the Thunder and Psychic damage increase by 1d6, and the spell’s range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Drowsy 
> This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
> * It moves at half speed.<br>
> * It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
> *  It can't concentrate. <br>
> * Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
> * The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
