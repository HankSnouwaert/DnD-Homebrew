## Lore of High Magic
This pure form of spellcraft weaves together every wind of magic in unison, allowing practitioners to directly manipulate the magical weave of existence. Such direct control of the weave makes its wielders especially adept at disrupting enemy spellcasters. Some spells intertwine different winds of magic at random for unpredictable effects, while others strike at the souls of creatures, severing or strengthening their bond to the weave.

High Magic has long been studied by ancient practitioners such as elves, who have uncovered uses ranging from planar travel to the summoning of eldritch phoenixes. Though many believe only these long-lived mages possess the skill to wield it, this esoteric art may yet fall into the hands of other ambitious arcanists.

#### Apotheosis
*4th-level Evocation (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose a creature within range that you can see and infuse it with pure magic, causing it to regain a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier and emit a wave of ascendant authority in a 30-foot emanation. 

Each creature of the target's choice that it can see within the emanation must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of the target until the end of your next turn.

 While Frightened, it can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the source of its fear by the safest available route.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The healing increases by 2d10 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Dampen Magic
*2nd-level Abjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** Reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of yourself casting a spell with verbal, somatic, or material components
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell is dampened. The caster can still choose to cast the spell, but it becomes weakened, and until the end of the your next turn:

* Attack rolls made by the spell have disadvantage.
* Targets have advantage on saving throws made to resist the spell.
* If the spell allows a creature to make a saving throw to take only half damage, a successful save causes no damage, and a failed save causes half damage instead.

If the caster chooses not to cast the spell, the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted, but the spell slot is not expended.

#### Disruptive Pulse
*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a wave of nullifying energy toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Thunder damage.

If the target is concentrating on a spell and must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, you can choose to set the saving throw DC equal to your spell save DC instead of the normal DC.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

#### Eldritch Deliverance
*1st-level Evocation (Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of meteorite)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a sudden pulse of eldritch energy at a point you can see within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 Force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 2d6, the radius increases by 5 feet, and the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

\columnbreak

#### Flames of the Phoenix
*7th-level Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Cction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an egg shell)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a fiery phoenix that blazes across the battlefield. A phoenix made of flame appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and immediately moves up to 60 feet in a straight line, stopping early if it encounters an impassable barrier. The phoenix can pass through openings large enough for a Tiny creature.

At the end of its movement, the phoenix erupts in an explosion of magical fire. All creatures in its path, as well as those within a 15-foot radius of the point where it explodes, must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 7d8 Fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

After the explosion, the phoenix leaves behind a hovering ember at the point where it detonated. The ember remains for the duration of the spell.

***Reviving the Phoenix.*** As an action on your turn, you can command the ember to reconstitute into the phoenix. When you do, the phoenix reforms in the ember’s space, moves up to 60 feet in a straight line, and explodes again, repeating the effects above. The ember then returns to its new detonation point.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Fire damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 7th.

#### Rays of Magic
*6th-level Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (prism glass)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You conjure three random rays of magic and hurl them at targets within range. Roll three times on the table below to determine the types of rays created. You can direct all the rays at one target or distribute them among multiple targets. Each ray requires a separate spell attack roll.

| d8 | Magic | Effect |
|:--:|:-----|:------|
| 1 | **Fire** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 fire damage and starts Burning*, taking 2d8 Fire damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends. |
| 2 | **Beasts** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Piercing damage. You or another willing creature within 60 feet of you can use its reaction to move up to half its speed toward or away from the target, without provoking opportunity attacks. |
| 3 | **Metal** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Bludgeoning damage, and its speed is halved as its limbs become heavy until the end of your next turn. |
| 4 | **Light** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Radiant damage, sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius, can’t benefit from being Invisible, and attack rolls against it have advantage until the end of your next turn. |
| 5 | **Life** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Slashing damage and is either pushed or pulled 20 feet in a straight line (your choice, toward or away from you). |
| 6 | **Heavens** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Lightning damage. You can choose a second creature within 10 feet of the target to take the same damage. |
| 7 | **Shadows** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Cold damage and deals only half damage with weapon attacks until the start of your next turn. A creature immune to Cold damage is unaffected by this secondary effect. |
| 8 | **Death** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Necrotic damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. |

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You create one additional ray for slot level above 6.

#### Soul Quench
*3rd-level Necromancy (Cleric, Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to rip the soul from a creature you can see within range. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or become Incapacitated until the start of your next turn. While Incapacitated, it has a speed of 0. On a successful save, the target has Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes until the start of your next turn. If a creature with 30 or fewer hit points fails the saving throw, it dies.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** A creature with 40 or fewer hit points will die; at 5th level, 50 hit points; at 6th, 60; at 7th, 70; at 8th, 80; at 9th, 90.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (prism glass)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A storm of chaotic magic surges in a 30-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point you choose within range. When you cast the spell, and as an bonus action on each of your turns thereafter, you can move the storm up to 60 feet in any direction. After moving the storm, roll on the table below. Each creature within the cylinder must make the appropriate saving throw or suffer the listed effect. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and suffers no additional effects.

| d8 | Magic | Effect |
|:--:|:-----|:------|
| 1 | **Fire** | Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 6d6 Fire damage and starts Burning*. It takes 2d6 Fire damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends. |
| 2 | **Beasts** | Each creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 6d6 Slashing damage. Until the end of your next turn, attack rolls against the creature have advantage if an ally of yours is within 5 feet of it and isn't Incapacitated. |
| 3 | **Metal** | Each creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 6d6 Force damage and becomes Petrified into metal until the end of your next turn. |
| 4 | **Light** | Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d6 Radiant damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of its next turn. This does not affect creatures that do not rely on sight, such as those with blindsight or immunity to Blindness. |
| 5 | **Life** | Each creature must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d6 Bludgeoning damage and is Restrained by magical vines (AC = your spell save DC, HP 15, immune to Poison and Psychic damage; Escape DC = your spell save DC). |
| 6 | **Heavens** | Each creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d6 Thunder damage and is knocked Prone. |
| 7 | **Shadows** | Each creature must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d6 Psychic damage and is Frightened of you until the start of your next turn. |
| 8 | **Death** | Each creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it takes 6d6 Necrotic damage. You regain 10 hit points for each creature that fails its saving throw. |

#### Walk Between Worlds
*4th-level Transmutation (Artificer, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** Bonus Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round 

You or a willing creature you touch shifts into the Ethereal Plane, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn or until the creature chooses to return early (no action required). The spell fails and the casting is wasted if the target is already on the Ethereal Plane.

While on the Ethereal Plane, the creature can move in any direction. Moving vertically costs an extra foot of movement per foot traveled. It can perceive the plane it left, which appears in shades of gray, but cannot see anything there beyond 60 feet.

While there, the creature can only affect and be affected by creatures, objects, and effects also on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive or interact with it unless they have a special ability that allows them to do so.

When the spell ends, the creature returns to the corresponding location on the plane it left. If that space is occupied, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it was displaced.
