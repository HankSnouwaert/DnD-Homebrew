# New Elemental Spells

#### Acid Rain
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a few pine needles)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard 
___

Acidic rain falls in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 4d4 acid damage and is covered in acid for the spell’s duration or until it, or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. A creature covered in the acid takes 4d4 acid damage at the end of its turns.

***At Higher Levels.*** The initial acid damage, as well as the acid damage dealt at the end of each of the acid-covered creature’s turns, is increased by 1d4 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Acid Wave
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a lemon slice)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, 
___

You conjure up a wave of acid that crashes down on an area within range. The area can be up to 30 feet long, up to 10 feet wide, and up to 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 6d4 bludgeoning damage and 6d4 acid damage, is knocked prone, and is covered in acid until the end of its next turn or until it or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. On a success, a creature takes half the initial damage and isn’t knocked prone or covered in acid.

\columnbreak

A creature covered in the acid takes 6d4 acid damage at the end of its turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the initial acid damage, initial bludgeoning damage, and the acid damage taken at the end of an acid-covered creature’s turn are all increased by 1d4 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Frost Nova

___

You cause a ring of ice and frost to burst out from you to a radius of up to a 20-feet. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.
 On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 cold damage, and until the end of your next turn, its speed is reduced by 20 feet, and it has disadvantage on weapon attack rolls. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the damage increases by 1d8 and the maximum possible radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
