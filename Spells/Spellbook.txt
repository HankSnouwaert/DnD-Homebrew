No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting a point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration without your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.

**Object.** An object targeted this way becomes jammed, and its internal parts are sealed together. For instance, a chest cannot be opened, a catapult cannot be fired, and a clock will stop turning.

You cause a creature to be gripped by freezing cold. Until the spell ends, at the end of each of your turns, if the target is within 90 feet of you, it must make Constitution saving throw.

A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way. Any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away after the spell ends.

Grasping limbs made of vines and branches sprout from the ground in a 30-foot square that is at least 10 feet deep, centered on a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. You can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the spell.

**Grabbing Creatures With The Limbs.** When the limbs first appear, each creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of the spell's origin point must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (its choice) or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 30 feet toward the center of the area and become restrained. 

Subsequently, any creature that ends its turn in the spell's area or ends its turn restrained by the spell must also make this saving throw.

However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell (including the initial failed save), it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with the petrified creature until the start of its next turn.

The foot passes through any Huge or smaller creatures and objects until it descends 500 feet or hits a solid surface, or a Gargantuan creature or object, at which point the foot rises back up into the sky to where its descent started. As an action on your turn, you can move the foot up to 30 feet, rotate it, and then have the foot descend in the same way.

Each creature or object the foot comes in contact with while descending must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so.

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

The hound is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the hound shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

**Detecting The Target.** The hound senses the direction to the chosen creature’s location and can see the creature as if it had truesight, as long as the creature is within 1,000 feet of the hound. If the creature is moving, the hound knows the direction of its movement. The hound cannot locate a creature if it is covered in or wearing wolfsbane.

You can give limited commands to the hound (no action required by you) to slow down, stop, return to you, or continue its normal behavior.

A barrier of mystical glyphs forms a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Up to three creatures of your choice within the sphere gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and lose any vulnerability to these damage types until the start of your next turn.

You choose a nonmagical plant of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. The plant comes to life at your command, and you may also have the plant grow up to Huge size if it is smaller. The plant uses the Animated Plant stat block while affected. When you cast the spell, you can choose to imbue the plant with one of the following features: Toxic, Grasping, or Smashing, which determines certain traits in its stat block. If the plant drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the plant reverts to its normal form and replants itself in the ground if it is able to.

The plant is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the plant shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

Choose one non-wondrous magic item you can see within range. The properties and powers of that magic item are suppressed for the duration of the spell—for example, a +1 longsword functions as a nonmagical longsword. If the item is a potion or other consumable, it does nothing upon being consumed. An item under the effect of this spell still counts as a magic item for the purposes of other spells and abilities, such as the *disintegrate* spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional magic item for each slot level above 2nd. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you may choose one wondrous magic item as one of your targets.

The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a moderate wind (at least 5 miles per hour) disperses it after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Each creature completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

#### Mind Spike (Revised)

Choose one creature that you have seen or heard within the last minute. If that creature is within range, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Additionally, on a failed save, you always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 

This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

___

You envelop a creature of your choice within range in a protective radiant light. Until the start of your next turn, the creature illuminates bright light out to a 10-foot radius and dim light out an additional 10 feet. During this time, attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage. This effect doesn't hinder attackers who don't depend on sight, such as those with blindsight or those who cannot be blinded.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. The chosen creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (A owl feather)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric
___

You release unholy wind in a 60-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line in a direction of your choice. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 cold damage and 4d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, either the cold or the necrotic damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Winter's Kiss

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 40-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. 

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, while restrained this way, the target takes 2d6 cold damage. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage and the damage at the end of the restrained target's turn are increased by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

- **Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

When you cast this spell, and as an action each round for the duration, you can make a ranged spell attack that targets one creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage and a sustained arc of lightning forms between you and it. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use an action to automatically deal 1d12 lightning damage to one target with which you have an arc. The arc ends for a target if it is ever outside the spell's range or if it gains total cover from you. The spell also ends if you use your action to do anything other than attack or deal damage using this spell.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3th level or higher, the initial damage and automatic damage increase by 1d12 for every two slot levels above 1st.



#### Withering Resolve
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard
___

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil. On a failed save, for the duration of the spell, the target has disadvantage on all checks and saving throws not triggered by this spell, and attack rolls against it have advantage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

#### World Sore
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You cause a boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see.  The boil occupies a 5-foot sphere centered on the chosen space.  The surface where a boil appears must be wide enough to accommodate its size.

The boil has AC 10, 20 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to piercing damage.  When reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into puss, and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity save.  Creatures take 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

On each of your turns, while you are within 100 feet of the boil and can see it, you can use your bonus action to either cause the boil to explode, as described above, or grow it.  Growing it increases its radius by 5 feet, increases the damage it deals when it blows up by 1d8, and extends the range of its explosion by 5 feet.  If there is no room for the boil to expand when you attempt to grow it, which includes being blocked by a creature, it remains its current size and explodes instead.  
The boil immediately explodes when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage when the boil explodes increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
