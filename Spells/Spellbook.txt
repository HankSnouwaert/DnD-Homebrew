- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of demon ichor)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
You open a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction.  A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered on a point within range that lasts for the spell's duration.  This sphere is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away.  No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting a point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration without your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.

- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

Each creature in a 15-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected for the duration.

On a failed save, the creature begins a painful, involuntary dance. While dancing, the creature:

* Can't take reactions or bonus actions.
* Must stand up if Prone, spending 5 feet of movement to do so.
* Must take the Dodge action.
* Must immediately use all its movement in a random direction. Roll 1d4 to determine the direction: 1—north, 2—east, 3—south, 4—west.
 
\columnbreak

At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If it did not move during its turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the creature falls Prone and the effect ends for it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The affected creature takes 1d10 Bludgeoning damage whenever it moves due to the spell. This damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

**Object.** An object targeted this way becomes jammed, and its internal parts are sealed together. For instance, a chest cannot be opened, a catapult cannot be fired, and a clock will stop turning. (If there is ever any doubt as to how an object will be impeded, imagine what would happen if glue were poured into all the crevices of the object; the spell should have the same effect.)

At the end of each of the creature's turns while on fire, it takes 4d6 fire damage.

**Extinguishing The Fire.** A creature can use its action to douse the fire by making a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a success, the flames are extinguished. The flames are also extinguished if the creature is fully submerged in water or standing in an area with strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour).

* Attack rolls made by the spell have disadvantage.
* Targets have advantage on saving throws made to resist the spell.
* If the spell allows a creature to make a saving throw to take only half damage, a successful save causes no damage, and a failed save causes half damage instead.

At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Constitution saving throw, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration becomes 24 hours and the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a short or long rest.

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range and a direction. A giant hammer manifests and slams the ground at the chosen point, impacting everything in a 10-foot cube centered on the point. It then sends a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-wide shockwave in the chosen direction before disappearing.

Each creature in the area of the hammer’s impact or shockwave must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 fire or lighting damage (your choice) and 5d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone; it is also dazed* until the end of its next turn if it is in the area of the impact. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or dazed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the fire or lighting damage and the thunder damage each increase by 1d6 for every slot level above 6th.

> #####  Divine Hammer Damage Types
> Depending on the nature of the god the spellcaster worships, it may make more sense for the divine hammer to do damage of a type other than fire or lighting; for example, some gods may be more associated with radiant or necrotic. At the DM's discretion, the damage can be changed this way, in which case the spellcaster should no longer have the option for fire or lighting.

#### Divine Judgment 1.0.0
*9th-level Divination (Cleric)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V

You call down divine judgment upon those around you. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. You gain insight into each creature's thoughts (if it has any), emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind—such as a fear, love, or hatred. You then choose for each creature to be subjected to one of the following effects:

**Guilty.**  The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 Radiant damage, falls Prone, and is Stunned until the start of your next turn. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing or carrying, except magic items, is reduced to a pile of fine salt.

If the creature is a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, it is instead banished to its plane of origin (if it is not already there) and cannot return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *Wish* spell.



\columnbreak

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

**Innocent.** The creature regains 8d6 hit points. In addition, it is cured of all diseases and any conditions causing it to be Blinded, Deafened, or Poisoned.

Grasping limbs made of vines and branches sprout from the ground in a 30-foot square that is at least 10 feet deep, centered on a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. You can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the spell.

**Grabbing Creatures With The Limbs.** When the limbs first appear, each creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of the spell's origin point must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (its choice) or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 30 feet toward the center of the area and become restrained. 

Subsequently, any creature that ends its turn in the spell's area or ends its turn restrained by the spell must also make this saving throw.

**Being Restrained By The Limbs.** A creature restrained by this spell cannot use teleportation or interplanar travel. If damage from the spell reduces a target to 0 hit points while it is in the difficult terrain, the creature is pulled underground, and its body is destroyed along with everything it is wearing and carrying, leaving no trace except for magic items, which come to the surface after the spell ends. 

Any creature, including the restrained one, can use its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a Strength check against your spell save DC.

On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

Additionally, the ground in the area becomes superheated for 1 minute. The area becomes difficult terrain, and any creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d12 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save.

**Ending The Effect.** A petrified target can make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell (including the initial failed save), it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with the petrified creature until the start of its next turn.

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure.  Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side it moves to. 

The fissure deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with it when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

You call forth a massive foot from the heavens to crash down onto the battlefield. You select a point you can see, between 30 to 500 feet above you within range. A 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide foot appears at the chosen point and immediately descends. The foot passes through any Huge or smaller creatures and objects until it descends 500 feet or hits a solid surface, or a Gargantuan creature or object, at which point the foot rises back up into the sky to where its descent started. As an action on your turn, you can move the foot up to 30 feet, rotate it, and then have the foot descend in the same way.

Each creature or object the foot comes in contact with while descending must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so. The creature is also pushed along with the foot until it rises back up. If a creature that fails the saving throw is already prone, it takes an additional 2d12 bludgeoning damage.

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

If it ends its movement more than 5 feet away from the chosen creature, the hound takes the Dash action, moving towards it. If it is within 5 feet of the chosen creature at the end of its movement, the hound takes the Attack action and attacks it. You can give limited commands to the hound (no action required by you) to slow down, stop, return to you, or continue its normal behavior.

If the hound cannot locate the creature, it returns to you. If the creature is dead, it sits by the creature’s remains and follows them if they are moved.

You create a cloud of putrescent vapor that appears in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured.  The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a strong wind (such as the one created by *gust of wind*) disperses it.

Each creature that starts its turn in the sphere must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be Poisoned until the start of its next turn.

Choose one creature that you have seen or heard within the last minute. If that creature is within range, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw.

Additionally, on a failed save, you always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Mirror Dance

You weave a shadowy link between yourself and a willing creature you can see within 30 feet, causing you and the creature to instantly swap places.

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust.

You or a willing creature you touch shifts into the Ethereal Plane, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn or until the creature chooses to return early (no action required).

While on the Ethereal Plane, the creature can move in any direction. Moving vertically costs an extra foot of movement per foot traveled. It can perceive the plane it left, which appears in shades of gray, but cannot see anything there beyond 60 feet.

While there, the creature can only affect and be affected by creatures, objects, and effects also on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive or interact with it unless they have a special ability that allows them to do so.
