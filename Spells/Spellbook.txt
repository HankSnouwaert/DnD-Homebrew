- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d12 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

| d8  |  Damage Type  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  1  | Acid |
|  2  | Cold|
|  3  | Fire|
|  4  | Force|
|  5  | Lightning|
|  6  | Poison | 
|  7  | Psychic |
|  8  | Thunder |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 60 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d12 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

#### Chaos Storm
*9th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of demon ichor)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
You open a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction.  A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered on a point within range that lasts for the spell's duration.  This sphere is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away.  No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting a point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration without your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.

- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

Each creature in a 15-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected for the duration.

On a failed save, the creature begins a painful, involuntary dance. While dancing, the creature:

* Can't take reactions or bonus actions.
* Must stand up if Prone, spending 5 feet of movement to do so.
* Must take the Dodge action.
* Must immediately use all its movement in a random direction. Roll 1d4 to determine the direction: 1—north, 2—east, 3—south, 4—west.
 
\columnbreak

At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If it did not move during its turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the creature falls Prone and the effect ends for it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The affected creature takes 1d10 Bludgeoning damage whenever it moves due to the spell. This damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Comet's Call
*5th-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A piece of iron or nickel ore)
- **Duration:**   1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Wizard, Sorcerer
___

You channel the winds of magic to summon a comet from the heavens to the battlefield. You select a point you can see, 300 feet above you within range, causing a blue pulse to flash in the sky. 

At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, nothing occurs. On a roll of 4-6, a 5-foot-radius comet materializes at the chosen point and immediately descends. The comet passes through any Large or smaller creatures and objects, exploding in a 30-foot-radius sphere when it hits a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. The explosion's effects spread around corners. 

Each creature or object the comet comes in contact with, as well as those within the explosion's area, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the comet's full damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success. The comet's base damage is 5d8 fire damage plus 5d8 bludgeoning damage. Each time you roll to see if the comet appears and it doesn't, the fire and bludgeoning damage it deals each increase by 1d8. The spell ends after the comet lands.

***At Higher Levels.*** Casting this spell using a 6th-level spell slot or higher increases either the fire damage or the bludgeoning damage (your choice) by 1d8 for every slot level above 5th.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action

You touch a construct creature or an object with moving parts that weighs no more than 4,000 pounds and is no larger than a 20-foot cube. 

**Construct.** A construct targeted this way must make a Dexterity saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

**Object.** An object targeted this way becomes jammed, and its internal parts are sealed together. For instance, a chest cannot be opened, a catapult cannot be fired, and a clock will stop turning. (If there is ever any doubt as to how an object will be impeded, imagine what would happen if glue were poured into all the crevices of the object; the spell should have the same effect.)

#### Conflagration

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and it can’t benefit from being invisible.

At the end of each of the creature's turns while on fire, it takes 4d6 fire damage.

**Extinguishing The Fire.** A creature can use its action to douse the fire by making a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a success, the flames are extinguished. The flames are also extinguished if the creature is fully submerged in water or standing in an area with strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour). 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

You curse a creature to age at an unnatural rate. Choose one creature within range. Until the spell ends, at the end of each of your turns, if the target is still within 90 feet of you, it must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 Necrotic damage, gains one level of Fatigue*, and ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before dying of old age. If it already has 30 days or fewer remaining in its lifespan, it instead ages 2d4 days. 

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not gain Fatigue or age. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell dies of old age and is reduced to dust.

This spell can’t be ended by *Dispel Magic*. Only *Remove Curse* cast with a 9th-level spell slot or a *Wish* spell can end the spell’s effects, restore the target to its previous age, and remove any Fatigue caused by this spell.

Each targeted creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be cursed by this spell for its duration.

While cursed:
* If the creature rolls an 18 or higher on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not caused by this spell, it automatically fails.
* When another creature makes an attack against the cursed target and rolls a 3 or lower on the attack roll, the attacking creature automatically hits.

At the end of its turn, an affected creature can attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending the curse's effect on it on a success.

* Attack rolls made by the spell have disadvantage.
* Targets have advantage on saving throws made to resist the spell.
* If the spell allows a creature to make a saving throw to take only half damage, a successful save causes no damage, and a failed save causes half damage instead.

You attempt to drain the vitality of a creature within range, leaving it feeble and vulnerable.

At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Constitution saving throw, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration becomes 24 hours and the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a short or long rest.

Each creature in the area of the hammer’s impact or shockwave must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 fire or lighting damage (your choice) and 5d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone; it is also dazed* until the end of its next turn if it is in the area of the impact. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or dazed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the fire or lighting damage and the thunder damage each increase by 1d6 for every slot level above 6th.

> #####  Divine Hammer Damage Types
> Depending on the nature of the god the spellcaster worships, it may make more sense for the divine hammer to do damage of a type other than fire or lighting; for example, some gods may be more associated with radiant or necrotic. At the DM's discretion, the damage can be changed this way, in which case the spellcaster should no longer have the option for fire or lighting.

#### Divine Judgment 1.0.0
*9th-level Divination (Cleric)*
___

You call down divine judgment upon those around you. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range.

You then choose for each creature to be subjected to one of the following effects:

**Guilty.**  The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 Radiant damage, falls Prone, and is Stunned until the start of your next turn. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing or carrying, except magic items, is reduced to a pile of fine salt.

If the creature is a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, it is instead banished to its plane of origin (if it is not already there) and cannot return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *Wish* spell.

\columnbreak

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

**Innocent.** The creature regains 8d6 hit points. In addition, it is cured of all diseases and any conditions causing it to be Blinded, Deafened, or Poisoned.

- **Classes:**  Druid

Grasping limbs made of vines and branches sprout from the ground in a 30-foot square that is at least 10 feet deep, centered on a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. You can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the spell.

**Grabbing Creatures With The Limbs.** When the limbs first appear, each creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of the spell's origin point must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (its choice) or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 30 feet toward the center of the area and become restrained. 

Subsequently, any creature that ends its turn in the spell's area or ends its turn restrained by the spell must also make this saving throw.

**Being Restrained By The Limbs.** A creature restrained by this spell cannot use teleportation or interplanar travel. If damage from the spell reduces a target to 0 hit points while it is in the difficult terrain, the creature is pulled underground, and its body is destroyed along with everything it is wearing and carrying, leaving no trace except for magic items, which come to the surface after the spell ends. 

Any creature, including the restrained one, can use its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a Strength check against your spell save DC.

On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

Additionally, the ground in the area becomes superheated for 1 minute. The area becomes difficult terrain, and any creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d12 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save.

However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell, it remains Petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Obsessed* with the Petrified creature until the start of its next turn.

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long. The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep. If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure; any fall damage the creature takes is doubled from falling this way.

You call forth a massive foot from the heavens to crash down onto the battlefield. You select a point you can see, between 30 to 500 feet above you within range. A 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide foot appears at the chosen point and immediately descends. The foot passes through any Huge or smaller creatures and objects until it descends 500 feet or hits a solid surface, or a Gargantuan creature or object, at which point the foot rises back up into the sky to where its descent started. As an action on your turn, you can move the foot up to 30 feet, rotate it, and then have the foot descend in the same way.

Each creature or object the foot comes in contact with while descending must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so. The creature is also pushed along with the foot until it rises back up. If a creature that fails the saving throw is already prone, it takes an additional 2d12 bludgeoning damage.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.

- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it can't gain advantage on the roll and it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

You call down visions of bloodlust and delusion that fracture the mind. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw (a creature can choose to fail). 

On a failed save, the creature becomes Berserk* until the spell ends. While Berserk, it is affected by one of the following conditions of your choice:

**Madness.** The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.

**Mania.** The creature has advantage on attack rolls.

At the end of each of its turns, a Berserk creature can repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (Water inside a gold-inlaid vial worth at least 400 gp)

- **Classes:**  Druid, Ranger

You choose a nonmagical plant of Huge size or smaller that you can see within range. The plant comes to life at your command, and you may also have the plant grow up to Huge size if it is smaller. The plant uses the Animated Plant stat block while affected. When you cast the spell, you can choose to imbue the plant with one of the following features: Toxic, Grasping, or Smashing, which determines certain traits in its stat block. If the plant drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the plant reverts to its normal form and replants itself in the ground if it is able to.

The plant is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the plant shares your initiative count but takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

Choose one non-wondrous magic item you can see within range. The properties and powers of that magic item are suppressed for the duration of the spell—for example, a +1 longsword functions as a nonmagical longsword. If the item is a potion or other consumable, it does nothing upon being consumed. An item under the effect of this spell still counts as a magic item for the purposes of other spells and abilities, such as the *disintegrate* spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional magic item for each slot level above 2nd. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you may choose one wondrous magic item as one of your targets.

You conjure a molten rock and hurl it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage. Whether the attack hits or misses, the rock explodes on impact, creating a 15-foot-radius sphere of whirling magma centered on the point of impact. The sphere lasts for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The sphere spreads around corners and seeps through openings at least 5 feet in diameter.

When the sphere first appears, and at the start of each of your turns thereafter, it moves 10 feet in the direction you hurled it from. Any creature whose space the sphere enters or passes through must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

Additionally, on a failed save, you always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 

This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

Then, each diseased creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is no longer infected by the disease and can't become infected by the spell for 24 hours. All diseases disappear when the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3.

- If you use a **3rd-level or higher** spell slot, choose an ability from the **Plague Symptom** table when you cast the spell. Creatures infected by this spell have Disadvantage on D20 Tests of the chosen ability not triggered by this spell.
- If you use a **6th-level or higher** spell slot, the diseased creatures have the Severe Symptom associated with the ability as well.

##### Plague Symptom  
| d6  |Ability  | Severe Symptom |
|:---:|:-----------|:-----------|
|  1  | **Wisdom.** | **Rabid.** The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to take actions that allow it to make one or more attacks. |
|  2  | **Charisma.** | **Rotted Flesh.** Any attack that hits the creature scores a critical hit on a roll of 15-20 |
|  3  | **Constitution.** | **Nauseous.** The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and checks. |
|  4  | **Intelligence.** | **Befuddled.** The creature is dazed (see condition below). |
|  5  | **Strength.** | **Atrophied** The creature deals only half damage with attacks. |
|  6  | **Dexterity.** |**Dizzy.** The creature cannot benefit from the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Additionally, if the creature chooses to move more than 5 feet on its turn, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of gold thread)

- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

- **Duration:** 1 round

You conjure three spinning blades of returning and launch them outwards. Each blade appears in an unoccupied 5-foot cube adjacent to you and immediately flies up to 100 feet in a straight line in a direction of your choice. The blades hover at their destinations until the start of your next turn, at which point they move back toward you in straight lines. A blade disappears when it reaches you or after it has traveled a total of 100 feet.

The first time a blade enters a creature’s space (other than yours) during its initial flight or return, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d10 Slashing damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 2d10 for every slot level above 8.

#### Regrowth

- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V S M (a diamond <br>worth at least 1,000 gp)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Cleric

As you call out words of restoration, up to six <br> creatures of your choice that you can see within range <br> regain hit points equal to 3d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. 

If you target a creature that has died within the last minute, that creature returns to life with 3d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier hit points. This spell can’t return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

Any creature targeted by the spell can immediately stand up without using any movement.

If you return one or more creatures to life with this spell, the diamond used to cast the spell is consumed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Rite of the Dead
*1st-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded skull worth at least 50 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

This spell creates an Undead servant. Choose a Medium or Small pile of bones or a corpse within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an Undead creature. The target becomes a **Skeleton Warrior** if you chose bones or a **Shambling Zombie** if you chose a corpse (this determines the stat block used). The Undead becomes inanimate again when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

Undead created by this spell are allies to you and your companions. In combat, they share your initiative count, but they take their turns immediately after yours. They obey your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, they take the Dodge action and use their movement to avoid danger.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You animate one additional Undead for every two spell slot levels above 1st. Each Undead must be created from a different corpse or pile of bones. If you cast this spell using a 5th-level or higher spell slot, the casting time becomes 1 Action and the range becomes 60 feet.

#### Savage Fists
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Druid, Ranger

Your fists become as hard as iron, and you are filled with fighting fury. When you cast this spell, you make an unarmed strike and gain the following benefits for the duration of the spell:

* You can use your spellcasting modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

* You can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

* You may use your spellcasting modifier when making Strength checks instead of your Strength modifier.

#### Searing Shard
*1st-level conjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** S, M (A small piece of sliver)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Artificer

You send a sizzling jagged silver shard from your fingertips flying at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 piercing damage, and the shard embeds in the creature. At the end of each of the creature's turns, it takes 2d8 fire damage if the shard is still embedded.

**Removing The Shard.** A creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the shard. On a success, the shard is removed, and on a failure, the shard is still removed, but the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the piercing, fire, and slashing damage each increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

___

Guided by an astral prophecy, your sight extends beyond the present moment. Until the spell ends, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, you can end the spell prematurely, allowing the creature to roll an additional d20. This decision can be made after the original roll but before the outcome is determined. The creature then chooses which of the d20s to use for the attack roll or saving throw.

Alternatively, if an attack is made against you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can end the spell to roll a d20 and then decide whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.

If multiple effects, such as another instance of this spell or a feature like the Lucky feat, attempt to modify a single roll, they negate each other, resulting in no additional dice being rolled.

On a hit, a creature takes 2d6 Fire damage and starts Burning*. A Burning creature takes 2d6 Fire damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends.

While Burning, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, it becomes Frightened of you until the start of its next turn and must use its movement to flee from you by the safest available route. If there is nowhere to move, it drops Prone and uses its action to try to extinguish the flames.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You create one additional ray for each spell slot level above 3.

#### Shield of Thorns

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

Additionally, whenever the bramble-covered creature hits a target with a melee attack or shoves a creature while within 5 feet of it, the target takes 5 piercing damage.

The line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

This whirlwind lasts for the spell's duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The tempest spreads around corners, seeping through openings large enough for a tiny creature.

When you cast the spell, choose a direction. When the storm first appears, and at the start of each of your turns afterward, the swirling skulls move 30 feet in the chosen direction. Any creature the storm passes though when moving must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct a cluster of skulls from the storm to streak toward a point you can see within 30 feet of the sphere. Once the skulls reach their destination or hit a solid surface, they lash out, biting at everything nearby. Every creature within 5 feet of where they stopped must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The skulls then return to the storm.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, damage dealt by the storm and the skull clusters increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

**Creatures Ending Their Turn In The Sphere.** Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way.

**The Spell's End.** When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the ice in the sphere shatters in an explosion. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes piercing damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on <br> a successful one. The spell's base damage is 2d8. <br> At the end of each of your subsequent turns after <br> the spell has been cast, if the sphere has not yet <br> exploded, the damage increases by 2d8.

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round 

You or a willing creature you touch shifts into the Ethereal Plane, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn or until the creature chooses to return early (no action required). The spell fails and the casting is wasted if the target is already on the Ethereal Plane.

While on the Ethereal Plane, the creature can move in any direction. Moving vertically costs an extra foot of movement per foot traveled. It can perceive the plane it left, which appears in shades of gray, but cannot see anything there beyond 60 feet.

While there, the creature can only affect and be affected by creatures, objects, and effects also on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive or interact with it unless they have a special ability that allows them to do so.

When the spell ends, the creature returns to the corresponding location on the plane it left. If that space is occupied, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it was displaced.

A Restrained creature can attempt to escape on its turn with a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC.

These restraining vines remain until they are destroyed or the spell ends. A creature can’t be restrained by more than one vine at a time. The vines have an AC equal to your spell save DC, 15 hit points, and are immune to Poison and Psychic damage. 

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You create one additional vine for each slot level above 7th.

This effect doesn't hinder attackers who don't depend on sight, such as those with blindsight or those who cannot be blinded.

*7th-level Conjuration (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure an animated weapon infused with magical power. Choose Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage when you cast the spell. The weapon appears in an unoccupied space within range and lasts for the duration.

When the weapon appears, you may immediately make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 damage of the chosen type and suffers an additional effect based on the type selected:

* **Bludgeoning:** You can move the target up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space.

* **Piercing:** Treat any 1 or 2 rolled on the damage dice as a 3.

* **Slashing:** The target’s speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.

___

You summon a sphere of pure nightmares that warps the minds of those caught within. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it.

A 20-foot-radius sphere of nightmares appears, centered on a point of your choice within range. When a creature enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. 

On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes Frightened of the sphere for the duration. While Frightened in this way, it can’t take reactions and must use the Dash action to move away from the sphere by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. At the end of each of its turns, the Frightened creature takes 5d10 Psychic damage and can then repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature that succeeds on its initial saving throw is immune to this spell for the rest of its duration.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet to a point you can see.

You release unholy wind in a 60-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line in a direction of your choice. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 5d6 Cold damage and 5d6 Necrotic damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Cold damage and the Necrotic damage increase by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 5.

#### Winter's Kiss
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 40-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. 

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, while restrained this way, the target takes 2d6 cold damage. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage and the damage at the end of the restrained target's turn are increased by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Witch Bolt (Revised)
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S M (a twig from a tree that has been struck by lightning)
- **Duration:** Up to 1 minute
- **Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

When you cast this spell, and as an action each round for the duration, you can make a ranged spell attack that targets one creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage and a sustained arc of lightning forms between you and it. On each of your turns for the duration, you can use an action to automatically deal 1d12 lightning damage to one target with which you have an arc. The arc ends for a target if it is ever outside the spell's range or if it gains total cover from you. The spell also ends if you use your action to do anything other than attack or deal damage using this spell.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3th level or higher, the initial damage and automatic damage increase by 1d12 for every two slot levels above 1st.

#### Witch's Broth and Brew
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of rotten food)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Bard, Druid
___

You hurl a potent concoction at one or two creatures you can see within range. If you target two creatures, they must be within 5 feet of each other. For each target, choose one of the following effects:

**Brew.** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or begin Burning*. While Burning, it takes 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier acid damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends.

**Broth.** The target regains 1d4 + your spellcasting modifier hit points.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage and healing increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Withering Gaze
*4th-level Necromancy (Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fixate on two points within range, no more than 40 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of dark magic erupt from your eyes, rotting anything between the two points. Each creature intersected by the beams’ path must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier Necrotic damage. If both points occupy the same space, creatures at that point have disadvantage on the saving throw.

You can cause up to four Undead creatures of your choice within the area to automatically succeed on the saving throw, taking no damage. Instead, they are infused with unholy power, gaining temporary hit points equal to the total Necrotic damage dealt by the spell. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4th.

#### Withering Heat
*7th-level Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of baked clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature to be gripped by blistering heat. Choose one creature within range. Until the spell ends, at the end of each of your turns, if the target is still within 90 feet of you, it must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes 7d10 Fire damage and gains one level of Fatigue*. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not gain Fatigue.

A creature that is immune to Fire damage cannot gain Fatigue from this spell.

Any levels of Fatigue caused by this spell are removed when the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 2d10 for every slot level above 7.

#### Withering Resolve
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard
___

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil. On a failed save, for the duration of the spell, the target has disadvantage on all checks and saving throws not triggered by this spell, and attack rolls against it have advantage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

\pagebreakNum

#### World Sore
*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You cause a festering boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see. The boil is a Medium object, and the surface must be wide enough to accommodate its size. When the spell ends, the boil shrivels and disappears.

The boil has AC 10, 30 hit points, immunity to psychic, poison, and necrotic damage, and vulnerability to piercing and slashing damage. It cannot regain hit points.

When the boil is reduced to 0 hit points, it bursts in a spray of toxic pus, creating a 20-foot-radius emanation centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The spell then ends.

At the start of each of your turns, while the spell is active, the boil swells with more pus, the damage it deals increases by 1d12, and it takes 3d6 force damage as it strains under its own pressure.

You can use your action to rupture the boil, reducing it to 0 hit points.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The hit points of the boil are increased by 10, and the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3.

#### Wrath of the Four Winds
*8th-level Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small leaf)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon the might of the four winds to buffet your enemies. Choose up to four creatures within range. Each creature must make a Strength saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature is pushed up to 60 feet in a direction of your choice (you may choose a different direction for each creature). If it is pushed into a solid surface or into another creature that also failed its saving throw, the pushed creature takes 6d8 Bludgeoning damage, is knocked Prone, and is Dazed* until the end of your next turn.

If a pushed creature would collide with another creature that did not fail its saving throw, that second creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, both it and the pushed creature take 6d8 Bludgeoning damage, are knocked Prone, and become Dazed* until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, both take half damage and suffer no other effects.

On a successful Strength save, a creature is pushed up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice and suffers no further effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 2d8 for every slot level above 8.
