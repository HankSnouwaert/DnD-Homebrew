A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 4d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd

#### Compelled Duel
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:** Up to 1 minute
- **Classes:** Paladin
___

You attempt to compel a creature into a duel.  One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw.  The creature fails the saving throw automatically if it hasn't been the target of harmful effects from creatures friendly to you within the last hour.  On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand.  For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.

The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

___
One creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and its eyes glow with madness. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.

On each of its turns, the charmed target must move up to its speed and use its action to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature. The charmed creature won't move into obviously dangerous hazards.

On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Additionally, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of the spell on a success.

The spell’s magic ends on the piece of ammunition when it hits or misses a target, and the spell ends when all the ammunition has lost its magic.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of pieces of ammunition you can affect with this spell increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.

The blade remains for the spell's duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. You can make the two attacks with the blade again on each of your turns as an action. The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

Any creature that observes you can attempt a Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature becomes aware that you are using magic to influence others. The consequences of this are at the DM’s discretion, but most creatures do not take kindly to such magical trickery, and whatever benefits you might have gained from your successful Charisma checks are usually reversed.

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S

You conjure a vine that sprouts from the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range.  When you cast this spell, you can direct the vine to lash out at a creature within 30 feet of it that you can see.  That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, which it can choose to fail, or be pulled up to 30 feet directly toward the vine and you may have the vine grapple it until the end of your next turn.  

A creature grappled by the vine can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC, freeing itself on a success.

Until the spell ends, as a bonus action on each of your turns, you can direct the vine to lash out at a creature or maintain its grapple on a creature until the end of your next turn, which deals 3d6 piercing damage to the grappled creature.

The vine has AC 14, 80 hit points, and vulnerability to slashing damage.  When it is reduced to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

Any given creature or object can't be struck by more than one bolt.  A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.

You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of nightmares centered on a point of your choice within range.  When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 4d10 psychic damage, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw.  On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration on any spells or abilities it is concentrating on, and becomes frightened for the duration.  While frightened by this spell, the creature can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the sphere by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.   A creature frightened this way dakes 4d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns.  It can then make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell's effect on it on a success.  The creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it has line of sight of the sphere.

Once a creature succeeds on its save against the spell, it can't be affected by it again for the remainder of the spell's duration.
