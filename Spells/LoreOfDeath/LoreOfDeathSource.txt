## Lore of Death

This brand of magic plays on the nature of mortality and fragility of life, though it is strictly distinct from traditional necromancy, as it embraces the inevitability of death rather than attempting to deny it. Its users can manipulate negative energy, sap the vitality of foes, and instill mortal terror in those around them. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Death often wield.

#### Aspect of Dread
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A white feather)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard 
___

A wave of terrifying specters spills out from a creature you can see within range in a 10-foot emanation. Every other creature within the emanation must make a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of the target for the duration.

A creature Frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot*** The emanation increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 3rd.



#### Crippling Pain
*3rd-level necromancy*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric Warlock, Wizard

You cause a creature within you can see within range to be wracked with pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, before the start of your next turn, it takes 4d8 Necrotic damage.

On a successful save, it takes 2d8 Necrotic damage instead.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3rd.


#### Horrifying Laughter
*6th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny tart and a feather waved in the air)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Wizard
___

You unleash a fit of deranged, magical laughter upon a creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or suffer the following effects:
* Take 3d10 Force damage.
* Fall prone.
* Become Incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration.

On a successful save, the target takes half damage, and the spell ends immediately.

While the target remains under the spell's effect, any other creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the laughing target and can hear it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of the laughing creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the start of each of your turns, the target repeats the Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it takes 3d10 Force damage again. On a success, the spell ends.

If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this spellâ€™s damage, it stabilizes but continues laughing, and can no longer attempt saving throws to end the spell. If the spell ends while the target has 0 hit points, it dies.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot*** The initial and recurring Force damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Impending Doom 
*4th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black feather)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it can't gain advantage on the roll and it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

####  Purple Sun
*9th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of lime, water, and earth)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a grim sphere of purple light at a point you designate within range. The sphere has a maximum radius of 60 feet and illuminates its area with dim light.

Any creature that either enters the sphere's area for the first time on its turn or begins its turn inside the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified for the duration. At the end of <br> each of its turns, the target can make another <br> Constitution saving throw. On a success, the <br> spell ends on the target. However, if a creature <br> accumulates three failed saves against this <br> spell (including the initial failed save), it <br> remains petrified indefinitely until the <br> condition is cured by other means.

If a petrified creature is physically <br> damaged or broken during this state, it <br> will manifest the same damage upon <br> being reverted to its original form.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot*** The Necrotic damage increases by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 1st.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The cold damage and the necrotic damage increase by 1d6 for each spell slot level above 5.
