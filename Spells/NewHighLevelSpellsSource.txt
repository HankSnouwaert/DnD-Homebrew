## New High Level Spells
The following is a list of new spells of 7th level or higher for a variety of classes and themes. They are intended to help fill gaps for certain themes at higher levels, allowing DMs to create high CR spellcasting creatures with those themes, and high-level players to have more options that fit their characters as they progress to higher levels.

#### Divine Judgment
*9th-level Divination (Cleric)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous

You call down divine judgment upon those around you. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. You gain insight into each creature's thoughts (if it has any), emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind—such as a fear, love, or hatred. You then choose for each creature to be subjected to one of the following effects:

**Guilty.**  The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 Radiant damage, falls Prone, and is Stunned until the start of your next turn. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing or carrying, except magic items, is reduced to a pile of fine salt.

\columnbreak

  If the creature is a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, it is instead banished to its plane of origin (if it is not already there) and cannot return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *Wish* spell.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

**Innocent.** The creature regains 8d6 hit points. In addition, it is cured of all diseases and any conditions causing it to be Blinded, Deafened, or Poisoned.

#### Meteor Swarm (Revised)
*9th-level Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous

You call down four blazing meteors at separate points you can see within range. Each meteor explodes in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on its impact point. The spheres spread around corners.

Each creature in an affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 Fire damage and 12d6 Bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. A creature caught in multiple areas of effect is only affected once.

The spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or carried.

#### Path of Shadows 
*7th-level Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon swirling shadows to whisk away up to six willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range. Each creature is teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you, and must appear within 15 feet of at least one other teleported creature.

Upon arriving, each creature becomes Invisible until the end of your next turn and may immediately take the Hide action (no action required).

#### Rebounding Blades 
*8th-level Conjuration (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small magnet)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You conjure three spinning blades of returning and launch them outwards. Each blade appears in an unoccupied 5-foot cube adjacent to you and immediately flies up to 90 feet in a straight line in a direction of your choice. The blades hover at their destinations until the start of your next turn, at which point they move back toward you in straight lines. A blade disappears when it reaches you or after it has traveled a total of 90 feet.

The first time a blade enters a creature’s space (other than yours) during its initial flight or return, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7d10 Slashing damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 2d10 for every slot level above 8.

#### Storm of Renewal
*8th-level Conjuration (Druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon a healing storm that takes the form of a raincloud in a 30-foot-radius, 10-foot-tall cylinder, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The cloud persists for the duration, releasing restorative rain that extinguishes exposed flames and washes away acid or slime covering the area.

When you cast the spell, and again at the start of each of your turns for the duration, you can choose up to three creatures within the cylinder. Each selected creature regains 4d8 hit points, and you can end one disease or one condition affecting it. The condition can be Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, or Poisoned.

#### Summon Stampede
*9th-level Conjuration (Druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of cattle feed)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a stampede of creatures that manifest in an unoccupied space you can see within range. These creatures use the Stampede stat block. The stampede disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The stampede is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the stampede shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.



___

>
> ***Unstoppable.*** The swarm’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither reduce the swarm’s speed nor cause it to be teleported or moved against its will.
>
> ### Actions

>
> ***Trample.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* Your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  6d10 + 20 Bludgeoning damage, or 3d10 + 10 Bludgeoning damage if the stampede has less than half its hit points. If the stampede moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 4d10 Bludgeoning damage or 2d10 if the stampede has less than half its hit points. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked Prone.

___

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a seed)

#### Warden's Wrath
*7th-level Conjuration (Druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (the stem of a plant with thorns)
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You are enveloped in thick, thorn-covered vines, gaining 50 temporary hit points for the duration of the spell.

Immediately after, three thorny vines lash out from you toward creatures within range. You can hurl the vines at one target or divide them among multiple creatures. 

Make a melee spell attack for each vine. On a hit, a target takes 4d6 Piercing damage, is pulled up to 20 feet closer to you, and becomes Restrained by conjured vines. A Restrained creature can attempt to escape on its turn with a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against your spell save DC.

These restraining vines remain until they are destroyed or the spell ends. A creature can’t be restrained by more than one vine at a time. The vines have an AC equal to your spell save DC, 15 hit points, and are immune to Poison and Psychic damage. 

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You create one additional vine for each slot level above 7th.

#### Weapon of Power
*7th-level Conjuration (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure an animated weapon infused with magical power. Choose Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage when you cast the spell. The weapon appears in an unoccupied space within range and lasts for the duration.

When the weapon appears, you may immediately make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 damage of the chosen type and suffers an additional effect based on the type selected:

* **Bludgeoning:** You can move the target up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space.

* **Piercing:** Treat any 1 or 2 rolled on the damage dice as a 3.

* **Slashing:** The target’s speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the weapon up to 20 feet to a space you can see and repeat the attack against the same or a different target within 5 feet.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 1d10 for every slot level above 7.


#### Weird (Revised) 1.0.0
*9th-level Illusion (Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___

You summon a sphere of pure nightmares that warps the minds of those caught within. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it.

A 20-foot-radius sphere of nightmares appears, centered on a point of your choice within range. When a creature enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. 

On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes Frightened of the sphere for the duration. While Frightened in this way, it can’t take reactions and must use the Dash action to move away from the sphere by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. At the end of each of its turns, the Frightened creature takes 5d10 Psychic damage and can then repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature that succeeds on its initial saving throw is immune to this spell for the rest of its duration.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet to a point you can see.

#### Withering Heat
*7th-level Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of baked clay)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You cause a creature to be gripped by blistering heat. Choose one creature within range. Until the spell ends, at the end of each of your turns, if the target is still within 90 feet of you, it must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes 7d10 Fire damage and gains one level of Fatigue*. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not gain Fatigue.

A creature that is immune to Fire damage cannot gain Fatigue from this spell.

Any levels of Fatigue caused by this spell are removed when the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 2d10 for every slot level above 7.


<br>

> ##### New Condition: Fatigue
> The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.
> 
> **Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.
> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue.

#### Wrath of the Four Winds
*8th-level Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small leaf)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon the might of the four winds to buffet your enemies. Choose up to four creatures within range. Each creature must make a Strength saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature is pushed up to 60 feet in a direction of your choice (you may choose a different direction for each creature). If it is pushed into a solid surface or into another creature that also failed its saving throw, the pushed creature takes 6d8 Bludgeoning damage, is knocked Prone, and is Dazed* until the end of your next turn.

If a pushed creature would collide with another creature that did not fail its saving throw, that second creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, both it and the pushed creature take 6d8 Bludgeoning damage, are knocked Prone, and become Dazed* until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, both take half damage and suffer no other effects.

On a successful Strength save, a creature is pushed up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice and suffers no further effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 4d6 for every slot level above 8.
