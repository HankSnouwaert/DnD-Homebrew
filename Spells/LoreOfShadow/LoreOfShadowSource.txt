## Lore of Shadow
This magic specializes in trickery, illusion, <br> and twisting the minds of its targets. Its <br> users primarily rely on illusory magic, though <br> they also wield spells that manipulate shadows <br> and even the nature of space and time as others <br> are able to perceive it, constantly leaving their <br> foes seconding guessing what they're seeing. <br> The following spells are examples of the types <br> of magic users of the Lore of Shadow often wield.

#### Creeping Strike 
*Evocation cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V S
- **Duration:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You lash out at an enemy with chilling shadows. <Br> Make a melee spell attack against the target. You <Br> have  advantage on the attack roll if the target is in <Br> darkness. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** This spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Mindrazors
*5th-level illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock, Bard
___

You envelop up to three weapons you can see within <Br> range in phantasmal shadows, allowing them to slice <Br> through the minds of their targets. For the duration, <Br> when a creature is hit by an attack from one of these <Br> infused weapons, it takes an additional 1d12 psychic damage.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

#### Mirror Dance
*2nd-level conjuration*

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

The creature must be no more than one size category larger than you. The spell fails if either of you would appear in a space that cannot accommodate your size.

#### Mystifying Miasma
*2nd-level illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Ranger, Bard
___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 


 This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Penumbral Pendulum
*4th-level illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You conjure a spectral pendulum that swings through a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, and 5-foot-tall line of your choice within range. Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot.

#### Pit of Shadows
*6th-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black cloth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

#### Shroud of Dusk

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (A drop of pitch or piece of coal)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You release a surge of chilling shadows in a 15-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 1d10 cold damage, and on a failed save, and half as much on a success.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The the line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:**  Ranger

Choose a willing creature you can see within range. The chosen creature becomes enveloped in a shroud of mist, enabling it to move with unseen swiftness. Until the start of your next turn, the creature's movement speed is doubled, it's quickened, and it becomes invisible along with everything it's wearing or carrying.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 3rd.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

___

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
