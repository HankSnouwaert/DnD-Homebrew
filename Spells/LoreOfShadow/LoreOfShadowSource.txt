## Lore of Shadow
This magic specializes in trickery, illusion, <br> and twisting the minds of its targets. Its <br> users primarily rely on illusory magic, though <br> they also wield spells that manipulate shadows <br> and even the nature of space and time as others <br> are able to perceive it, constantly leaving their <br> foes seconding guessing what they're seeing. <br> The following spells are examples of the types <br> of magic users of the Lore of Shadow often wield.

#### Creeping Strike
*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___

You lash out at an enemy with chilling shadows. <br> Make a melee spell attack against the target. You <br> have Advantage on the attack roll if the target is in <br> Darkness. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Cold damage.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

#### Mindrazors

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  
___

You envelop up to three weapons you can see within range in phantasmal shadows, allowing them to slice through the minds of their targets. For the duration, when a creature is hit by an attack from one of these infused weapons, it takes an additional 1d12 Psychic damage.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional Psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional weapon for each spell slot level above 5.

#### Mirror Dance

___

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

The creature must be no more than one size category larger than you. The spell fails if either of you would appear in a space that cannot accommodate your size.

#### Mystifying Miasma 
*2nd-level Illusion (Ranger, Bard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 

This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area Heavily Obscured for all creatures lacking True Sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls Prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The radius of the fog increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2.

#### Penumbral Pendulum 
*4th-level Illusion (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___

You conjure a spectral pendulum that swings through a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, and 5-foot-tall line of your choice within range. Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 Psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

At the end of each of your subsequent turns during the duration, the pendulum swings back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4.

#### Pit of Shadows

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The size of the square increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2.

___

You release a surge of chilling shadows in a 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 1d10 Cold damage, and on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The line's area is then plunged into magical Darkness until the end of your next turn. This Darkness is impenetrable to Darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 10 for each slot level above 1.

On a success, the creature has Disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
