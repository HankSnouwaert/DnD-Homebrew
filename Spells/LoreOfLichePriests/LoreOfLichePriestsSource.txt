## Lore of <Br> Liche-Priests
This ancient lore of magic was <br> developed by the liche-priests of <br> the long-gone Tomb Kingdom <br> empire. The undying liche-priests <br> are still its primary practitioners, but <br> the secrets of this lore have slipped out <br> into the hands of other desert peoples <br> and arcane archeologists. Its magic <br> focuses on incantations designed to bolster <br> the effectiveness of soldiers, magic that <br> harnesses the power of the desert, and curses <br> that conjure the underworld spirits and punish <br> trespassers. The following spells are examples <br> of the types of magic users of the Lore of <br> Liche-Preists often wield.

#### Cursed Blades
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You imbue a weapon within range with the essence of death. When this weapon hits a creature, the target becomes cursed for the spell's duration. At the start of your turn, each creature cursed this way within 90 feet of you takes 1d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional weapon for each slot level above 1st. Using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher increases the damage by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.

#### Decrepify
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A handful of shriveled weeds)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You attempt to drain the vitality of a creature within range, leaving it feeble and vulnerable. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and its Strength and Dexterity scores reduced to 1. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Constitution saving throw, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration becomes 24 hours and the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a short or long rest. If you use an 8th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled and no longer requires Concentration; the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a long rest.

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

#### Guiding Wind
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A legume seed)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Cleric
___

You summon a potent gust of wind, forming a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This wind then moves in a straight line up to 30 feet in a direction you choose. When the sphere initially forms, any Medium or smaller creature or unsecured object within its area is lifted and carried by the wind for the distance it travels. Creatures can choose to resist and remain stationary instead of being carried by the wind.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the sphere can travel an additional 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Incantation of Protection
*2nd level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Bard, Paladin
___

A barrier of mystical glyphs forms a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Up to three creatures of your choice within the sphere gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage and lose any vulnerability to these damage types until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Incantation of Zeal

*2nd level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  1 round.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Bard, Paladin
___

A brilliant light emanates from a point within range, forming a 10-foot-radius sphere. Up to three creatures of your choice within the sphere are quickened until the start of your next turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Skull Storm
*6th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tooth)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock
___

You summon a swirling tempest of skulls in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This whirlwind lasts for the spell's duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The tempest spreads around corners and adheres to the contours of the terrain, seeping through openings large enough for Small creatures.
When you cast the spell, choose a direction. When the storm first appears, and at the start of each of your turns afterward, the swirling skulls move 30 feet in the chosen direction.

Any creature the storm moves into, or that ends its turn within the storm, must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct a cluster of skulls from the storm to streak toward a point you can see within 30 feet of the sphere. Once the skulls reach their destination or hit a solid surface, they lash out, biting at everything nearby. Every creature within 5 feet of where they stopped must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The skulls then return to the storm.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage dealt by the storm and the skull clusters increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
