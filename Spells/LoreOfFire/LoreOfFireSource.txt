## Lore of Fire

This brand of magic draws on the power of elemental fire. This arcane fire is often fueled by powerful emotions, and those who wield it are often known for their reckless and headstrong behavior. By channeling their fiery nature into their magic, these pyromancers can unleash an array of devastating spells capable of burning foes to cinders. These spells all tend to conjure and manipulate fire in some way and are very aggressive in nature. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Fire often wield.

#### Burning Bolts
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A burnt stick)
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose up to three directions. A line of flames 100 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in each direction you choose. Each creature in a line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one line is affected only once.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create one additional line of flames for each slot level above 6th.

#### Burning Head
*5th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

A 5-foot-diameter flaming head appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. When the head appears, it lets out a terrifying screech. Creatures of your choice that can see and hear the head within 100 feet of it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the head until the spell ends. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the head, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Contact With The Head.** Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the head must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

**Moving The Head.** As a bonus action, you can move the head up to 30 feet. If you ram the head into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the head’s damage, and the head stops moving this turn. When you move the head, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The head ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Conflagration

*4th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose one creature you have seen within the last minute. If the creature is within range, it is engulfed in an inferno. The target takes 4d6 fire damage and is set on fire for the spell’s duration. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and it can’t benefit from being invisible.

At the end of each of the creature's turns while on fire, it takes 4d6 fire damage.

**Extinguishing The Fire.** A creature can use its action to douse the fire by making a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a success, the flames are extinguished. The flames are also extinguished if the creature is fully submerged in water or standing in an area with strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour). 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.


#### Flame Arrows
*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:** Artificer, Druid, Ranger, Sorcerer, Wizard, 
___

You touch up to twelve arrows or bolts. When a target is hit by a ranged weapon attack using one of these pieces of ammunition, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage, and if it is a flammable object, it is ignited. The spell’s magic ends on the piece of ammunition when it hits or misses a target, and the spell ends when all the ammunition has lost its magic.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the number of pieces of ammunition you can affect with this spell increases by two for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Flame Blade
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S M (leaf of sumac)
- **Duration:** Up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:** Druid, Sorcerer
___

You evoke a fiery blade, similar in size and shape to a scimitar, in your free hand. When you cast this spell, you may make two melee spell attacks with the blade against any targets within your reach. On a hit, a target takes fire damage equal to 1d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The blade remains for the spell's duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. You can make the two attacks with the blade again on each of your turns as an action. The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may make one additional attack with the blade per action for every two slot levels above 2nd.


#### Flame Cage
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small piece of phosphorus)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

You choose a point on a solid surface within range, causing a cage made of opaque flames in the shape of a cube to appear. The cube can be up to 30 feet on each side, and it lasts for the duration. 

**Creatures Caught Partially Within the Cage.** When the cage is created, creatures only partially within the cube's area, or those too large to fit inside the area, must choose to be pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area or move into the cage if they can fit. 

**Creatures In The Cage When It Forms.** Any creature fully within the cage when it forms (including those that chose to move inside it) must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 7d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

**Moving Through The Cage.** A creature takes the 7d8 fire damage when it passes through a side of the cube for the first time on a turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
