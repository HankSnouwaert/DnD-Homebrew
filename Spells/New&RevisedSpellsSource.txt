You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A cloud of putrescent vapor appears in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a moderate wind (at least 5 miles per hour) disperses it after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Each creature completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.



#### Mindrazors 1.0.0

___

- **Range:** 30 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock, Bard
___

You envelop up to three weapons you can see within range in phantasmal shadows, allowing them to slice through the minds of their targets. For the duration, when a creature is hit by an attack from one of these infused weapons, it takes an additional 1d12 psychic damage.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

#### Molten Sphere 0.0.0
*6th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a smooth piece of igneous rock)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer
___

You summon forth a 10-foot-diameter sphere of magma in an unoccupied space of your choice within range.  The sphere then rolls along the ground in a straight line up to 60 feet in a direction you choose before exploding.  The sphere explodes early if it impacts a solid surface or falls more than 10 feet.  If the sphere would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.  On a failed save, the sphere strikes the target and explodes.  When the sphere explodes, each creature within a 20-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d8 fire damage.  Creatures who pass their save take half as much damage, and a creature hit by the sphere fails the save automatically. 

Any surface the sphere rolls across or in the range of its explosion is covered in 3-inch-thick lava until the spell ends.  The lava is difficult terrain, and when a creature moves into or within an area with lava, it takes 4d4 fire damage for every 5 feet it travels.  The creature also takes this damage if it ends its turn touching the lava. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage and fire damage from the explosion both increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Monstrous Transformation 1.1.0

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

The sphere then rolls along the ground in a straight line up to 60 feet in a direction you choose before exploding.  The sphere explodes early if it impacts a solid surface or falls more than 10 feet.  If the sphere would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.

This spell enables you to broadcast a brief message, no longer than four seconds in length, to each creature within 3 miles of your location. Recipients of the message hear it in their minds and, if they know you, recognize you as the sender. Additionally, they discern your distance and direction at the time of casting. The spell ensures that creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 1 can comprehend the message's meaning. 

A sleeping creature can hear the message and may choose to awaken upon hearing it.

You can tailor the spell to target specific types of creatures only, such as humans, giants, unicorns, etc.

The message cannot be received by any creature if there is any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocking a direct path between you and the creature.

___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 

This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Components:** V S M (A white thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.

Should a creature inside the web attempt to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. A successful save allows the creature to utilize its spell or ability to exit the web, while a failure causes the spell or ability to be expended without effect. Notably, this net of light also extends into the Ethereal Plane, preventing ethereal escape.

A restrained creature can take an action on its turn to attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending its restrained condition on a success.

You conjure a spectral pendulum that swings through a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, and 5-foot-tall line of your choice within range. Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot.

The creatures whisper dark promises of fulfillment, seducing and bewildering hapless foes.  You can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the spell.  An affected creature in the area of the spell suffers disadvantage on Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws and checks to maintain concentration.  The spell ends if you move more than 60 feet away from the area under its effect.

On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

\columnbreak

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

On a failed save, the creature is petrified for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell (including the initial failed save), it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

If a petrified creature is physically damaged or broken during this state, it will manifest the same damage upon being reverted to its original form.

A creature afflicted by this disease takes 4d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of your turns and must then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. 

If a diseased creature drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can end the disease on the creature and cause it to infect a new creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it. The new creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be infected with the same disease for the remainder of the spell's duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, each time it would deal damage, it deals an additional 1d10 necrotic damage for each slot level above 4th.

___

You call forth a formidable creature of your choice: a **Stone Hurling Giant**, a **Madding Jabberwocky**, or a **Hungering Behemoth**. It materializes in an unoccupied space within range and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

This primitive creature is allied with you and your companions. It acts on your initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. You can telepathically communicate with the creature while you are on the same plane, and you are both aware of each other's locations. It follows your telepathic commands without requiring an action from you. If not given any commands, it automatically moves toward and attacks the nearest creature it detects.

If the creature moves more than 100 feet from you, your concentration on the spell is broken. Additionally, at the start of its turn, if the creature has taken damage since its last turn, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn't disappear but becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and you lose control over it. The uncontrolled creature cannot be dismissed by you and will disappear 1 hour after it was summoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the summoned creature gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 7th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, the spell's duration extends to 8 hours.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the behemoth can't bite another target. If the target is a Large or smaller and already grappled by the behemoth, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behemoth, and it takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the behemoth's turns. If the behemoth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

#### Second Sight 0.0.0
*2nd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

Guided by an astral prophecy, your sight extends beyond the present moment. Until the spell ends, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, you can end the spell prematurely, allowing the creature to roll an additional d20. This decision can be made after the original roll but before the outcome is determined. The creature then chooses which of the d20s to use for the attack roll or saving throw.

Alternatively, if an attack is made against you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can end the spell to roll a d20 and then decide whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.

If multiple effects, such as another instance of this spell or a feature like the Lucky feat, attempt to modify a single roll, they negate each other, resulting in no additional dice being rolled.

You attempt to trigger a mad frenzy in a creature you can see within range.

You summon a swirling tempest of skulls in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This whirlwind lasts for the spell's duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The tempest spreads around corners, seeping through openings large enough for a tiny creature.
When you cast the spell, choose a direction. When the storm first appears, and at the start of each of your turns afterward, the swirling skulls move 30 feet in the chosen direction. Any creature the storm passes though when moving must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct a cluster of skulls from the storm to streak toward a point you can see within 30 feet of the sphere. Once the skulls reach their destination or hit a solid surface, they lash out, biting at everything nearby. Every creature within 5 feet of where they stopped must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The skulls then return to the storm.

The rains can grant healing a number of times equal to 3 plus your spell casting modifier (minimum 4 times).  After granting healing that number of times, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing received increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 5th.

Choose a willing creature you can see within range. The chosen creature becomes enveloped in a shroud of mist, enabling it to move with unseen swiftness. Until the start of your next turn, the creature's movement speed is doubled, it's quickened, and it becomes invisible along with everything it's wearing or carrying.

___

You cause a swarm of insects to erupt from the ground within a 10-foot square area at a point you choose within range. Each creature standing in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 piercing damage, and insects burrow into the creature, remaining there for the spell's duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage, and the insects do not burrow into it. 

While the insects are burrowed in a creature, the creature has disadvantage on checks, cannot regain hit points, and takes 2d4 piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. 

Any creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the insects from a creature. This check must be done using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, and it causes 1d4 damage of its damage type to the target. On a successful check, all the insects are destroyed, and the spell ends for that creature. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the insects, but if it does, the target takes 3d4 damage instead. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

___

You envelop a creature of your choice within range in a protective radiant light. Until the start of your next turn, the creature illuminates bright light out to a 10-foot radius and dim light out an additional 10 feet. During this time, attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage. This effect doesn't hinder attackers who don't depend on sight, such as those with blindsight or those who cannot be blinded.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. The chosen creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

___
You create a 30-foot-radius sphere of nightmares centered on a point of your choice within range.  When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 4d10 psychic damage, and it must make a Wisdom saving throw.  On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration on any spells or abilities it is concentrating on, and becomes frightened for the duration.  While frightened by this spell, the creature can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the sphere by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.   A creature frightened this way dakes 4d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns.  It can then make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the spell's effect on it on a success.  The creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it has line of sight of the sphere.

\columnbreak

Once a creature succeeds on its save against the spell, it can't be affected by it again for the remainder of the spell's duration.

As an action on your subsequent turns, you can move the sphere up to 60 feet to a point you can see.

Medium or smaller objects in this area that aren't secured and aren't being worn or carried are pushed up to 15 feet in the chosen direction. Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed in the chosen direction and knocked prone. The wind also disperses gas and vapor and extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in its area.

When you cast this spell, and as an action each round for the duration, you can make a ranged spell attack that targets one creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage and a sustained arc of lightning forms between you and it. 

On each of your turns for the duration, you can use an action to automatically deal 1d12 lightning damage to one target with which you have an arc. The arc ends for a target if it is ever outside the spell's range or if it gains total cover from you. The spell also ends if you use your action to do anything other than attack or deal damage using this spell.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You cause a boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see.  The boil occupies a 5-foot sphere centered on the chosen space.  The surface where a boil appears must be wide enough to accommodate its size.

The boil has AC 10, 20 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to piercing damage.  When reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into puss, and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity save.  Creatures take 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

On each of your turns, while you are within 100 feet of the boil and can see it, you can use your bonus action to either cause the boil to explode, as described above, or grow it.  Growing it increases its radius by 5 feet, increases the damage it deals when it blows up by 1d8, and extends the range of its explosion by 5 feet.  If there is no room for the boil to expand when you attempt to grow it, which includes being blocked by a creature, it remains its current size and explodes instead.  
The boil immediately explodes when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage when the boil explodes increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
