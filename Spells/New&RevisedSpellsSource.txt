___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a wolf tooth)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Warlock

You attempt to encase a creature you can see within range in ice. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (the target can choose to fail), or it becomes entombed in ice for the spell's duration. While entombed this way, it gains 40 temporary hit points, is incapacitated, and has resistance to all damage except fire and thunder damage. 

The air within 15 feet of the entombed creature is chilled. When a creature other than the entombed creature enters this chilled area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 cold damage, and its speed is halved until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed is not halved.

The spell ends early if the entombed creature loses all the temporary hit points granted by the spell. The creature also loses these temporary hit points when the spell ends.

If you cast this spell on yourself, you do not lose concentration on it as a result of taking damage or being incapacitated. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the entombed creature gains 10 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 5th.

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.

Should a creature inside the web attempt to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. A successful save allows the creature to utilize its spell or ability to exit the web, while a failure causes the spell or ability to be expended without effect.

When reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into puss, and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity save.

On each of your turns, while you are within 100 feet of the boil and can see it, you can use your bonus action to either cause the boil to explode, as described above, or grow it.  Growing it increases its radius by 5 feet, increases the damage it deals when it blows up by 1d8, and extends the range of its explosion by 5 feet.
