- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d12 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

| d8  |  Damage Type  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  1  | Acid |
|  2  | Cold|
|  3  | Fire|
|  4  | Force|
|  5  | Lightning|
|  6  | Poison | 
|  7  | Psychic |
|  8  | Thunder |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 60 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d12 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

#### Chaos Storm 1.0.0
*9th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of demon ichor)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
You open a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction.  A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered on a point within range that lasts for the spell's duration.  This sphere is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away.  No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration outside of your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.

#### Chaotic Pavane 1.0.0

- **Components:** V S M (a bit of catgut)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

Each creature in a 15-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected for the duration.

On a failed save, the creature begins a painful, involuntary dance. While dancing, the creature:

* Can't take reactions or bonus actions.
* Must stand up if Prone, spending 5 feet of movement to do so.
* Must take the Dodge action.
* Must immediately use all its movement in a random direction. Roll 1d4 to determine the direction: 1—north, 2—east, 3—south, 4—west.

\columnbreak

At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If it did not move during its turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the creature falls Prone and the effect ends for it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The affected creature takes 1d10 Bludgeoning damage whenever it moves due to the spell. This damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Compelled Duel (Revised) 0.0.0
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:** Up to 1 minute
- **Classes:** Paladin
___

You attempt to compel a creature into a duel.  One creature that you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw.  The creature fails the saving throw automatically if it hasn't been the target of harmful effects from creatures friendly to you within the last hour.  On a failed save, the creature is drawn to you, compelled by your divine demand.  For the duration, it has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you, and must make a Wisdom saving throw each time it attempts to move to a space that is more than 30 feet away from you; if it succeeds on this saving throw, this spell doesn't restrict the target's movement for that turn.

The spell ends if you attack any other creature, if you cast a spell that targets a hostile creature other than the target, if a creature friendly to you damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if you end your turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

- **Components:** V, S, M (A piece of iron or nickel ore)
- **Duration:**   1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Wizard, Sorcerer
___

You channel the winds of magic to summon a comet from the heavens to the battlefield. You select a point you can see, 300 feet above you within range, causing a blue pulse to flash in the sky. 

At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, nothing occurs. On a roll of 4-6, a 5-foot-radius comet materializes at the chosen point and immediately descends. The comet passes through any Large or smaller creatures and objects, exploding in a 30-foot-radius sphere when it hits a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. The explosion's effects spread around corners. 

Each creature or object the comet comes in contact with, as well as those within the explosion's area, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the comet's full damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success. The comet's base damage is 5d8 fire damage plus 5d8 bludgeoning damage. Each time you roll to see if the comet appears and it doesn't, the fire and bludgeoning damage it deals each increase by 1d8. The spell ends after the comet lands.

***At Higher Levels.*** Casting this spell using a 6th-level spell slot or higher increases either the fire damage or the bludgeoning damage (your choice) by 1d8 for every slot level above 5th.

- **Classes:**  Artificer

You touch a construct creature or an object with moving parts that weighs no more than 4,000 pounds and is no larger than a 20-foot cube. 

**Construct.** A construct targeted this way must make a Dexterity saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

**Object.** An object targeted this way becomes jammed, and its internal parts are sealed together. For instance, a chest cannot be opened, a catapult cannot be fired, and a clock will stop turning. (If there is ever any doubt as to how an object will be impeded, imagine what would happen if glue were poured into all the crevices of the object; the spell should have the same effect.)

The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and it can’t benefit from being invisible.

At the end of each of the creature's turns while on fire, it takes 4d6 fire damage.

**Extinguishing The Fire.** A creature can use its action to douse the fire by making a Dexterity check against your spell save DC. On a success, the flames are extinguished. The flames are also extinguished if the creature is fully submerged in water or standing in an area with strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour). 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

* Cannot speak or understand any language
* Is treated as a beast with an Intelligence score of 4 when targeted by spells and abilities that normally only target beasts, such as *dominate beast* or *beast bond* (This doesn't change its actual Intelligence score)

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, the affected creature takes 1d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns while under this spell's effects before it makes the saving throw.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range and a direction. A giant hammer manifests and slams the ground at the chosen point, impacting everything in a 10-foot cube centered on the point. It then sends a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-wide shockwave in the chosen direction before disappearing.

\columnbreak

Each creature in the area of the hammer’s impact or shockwave must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 fire or lighting damage (your choice) and 5d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone; it is also dazed* until the end of its next turn if it is in the area of the impact. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or dazed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the fire or lighting damage and the thunder damage each increase by 1d6 for every slot level above 6th.

> #####  Divine Hammer Damage Types
> Depending on the nature of the god the spellcaster worships, it may make more sense for the divine hammer to do damage of a type other than fire or lighting; for example, some gods may be more associated with radiant or necrotic. At the DM's discretion, the damage can be changed this way, in which case the spellcaster should no longer have the option for fire or lighting.



#### Divine Judgment 1.0.0
*9th-level Divination (Cleric)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action

You call down divine judgment upon those around you. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. You gain insight into each creature's thoughts (if it has any), emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind—such as a fear, love, or hatred. You then choose for each creature to be subjected to one of the following effects:

**Guilty.**  The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 Radiant damage, falls Prone, and is Stunned until the start of your next turn. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing or carrying, except magic items, is reduced to a pile of fine salt.

If the creature is a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, it is instead banished to its plane of origin (if it is not already there) and cannot return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *Wish* spell.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

**Innocent.** The creature regains 8d6 hit points. In addition, it is cured of all diseases and any conditions causing it to be Blinded, Deafened, or Poisoned.

- **Classes:**  Druid

Grasping limbs made of vines and branches sprout from the ground in a 30-foot square that is at least 10 feet deep, centered on a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. You can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the spell.

**Grabbing Creatures With The Limbs.** When the limbs first appear, each creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of the spell's origin point must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (its choice) or take 10d6 bludgeoning damage and be pulled 30 feet toward the center of the area and become restrained. 

Subsequently, any creature that ends its turn in the spell's area or ends its turn restrained by the spell must also make this saving throw.

**Being Restrained By The Limbs.** A creature restrained by this spell cannot use teleportation or interplanar travel. If damage from the spell reduces a target to 0 hit points while it is in the difficult terrain, the creature is pulled underground, and its body is destroyed along with everything it is wearing and carrying, leaving no trace except for magic items, which come to the surface after the spell ends. 

Any creature, including the restrained one, can use its action to free the restrained creature by succeeding on a Strength check against your spell save DC.

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.

* Take 3d10 Force damage.
* Fall prone.
* Become Incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration.

On a successful save, the target takes half damage, and the spell ends immediately.

While the target remains under the spell's effect, any other creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the laughing target and can hear it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of the laughing creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the start of each of your turns, the target repeats the Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it takes 3d10 Force damage again. On a success, the spell ends.

If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell’s damage, it stabilizes but continues laughing, and can no longer attempt saving throws to end the spell. If the spell ends while the target has 0 hit points, it dies.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot*** The initial and recurring Force damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.


####  Hunting Hound 1.0.0

*5th-level conjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A golden whistle worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Ranger
___

Choose a creature that is familiar to you and that you have seen within the last 30 minutes. You then call forth a mechanical hound, which manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This **hunting hound** uses the stat block below. The hound is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the hound shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

**Detecting The Target.** The hound senses the direction to the chosen creature’s location and can see the creature as if it had truesight, as long as the creature is within 1,000 feet of the hound. If the creature is moving, the hound knows the direction of its movement. The hound cannot locate a creature if it is covered in or wearing wolfsbane.

**The Hound's Behavior.** On its turn, the hound moves towards the chosen creature, avoiding any damaging terrain. If it ends its movement more than 5 feet away from the chosen creature, the hound takes the Dash action, moving towards it. If it is within 5 feet of the chosen creature at the end of its movement, the hound takes the Attack action and attacks it. You can give limited commands to the hound (no action required by you) to slow down, stop, return to you, or continue its normal behavior.

If the hound cannot locate the creature, it returns to you. If the creature is dead, it sits by the creature’s remains and follows them if they are moved.

A wave of cold 30 feet long and 15 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. The ground in the area is covered with ice, turning it into difficult terrain for the duration.

**Destroying The Ice.** A 5-foot square area of ice can be destroyed by attacking it (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). 

**Slipping On The Ice.** When the ice appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. 

**Being Caught In The Water.** If a creature is swimming in an area where ice appears, it must make a Strength saving throw instead or become restrained by ice for the duration. A creature restrained by the ice or another creature that can reach it can also use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed. The target is also freed if any ice where at its location is destroyed. On a successful save, the creature can move below or above the now frozen surface.

When the ice storm initially appears or if a creature is inside its area at the end of your next turn, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

When you cast the spell, you can choose to imbue the plant with one of the following features: Toxic, Grasping, or Smashing, which determines certain traits in its stat block. If the plant drops to 0 hit points or the spell ends, the plant reverts to its normal form and replants itself in the ground if it is able to.

When the sphere explodes, each creature within a 20-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d8 fire damage.  Creatures who pass their save take half as much damage, and a creature hit by the sphere fails the save automatically.

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

___

You summon forth a 10-foot-diameter sphere of mud in an unoccupied space of your choice within range.  The sphere then rolls along the ground in a straight line up to 60 feet in a direction you choose before exploding.  The sphere explodes early if it impacts a solid surface or falls more than 10 feet.  If the sphere would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.  On a failed save, the sphere strikes the target and explodes.  When the sphere explodes, each creature within a 10-foot radius must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn.  A creature hit by the sphere fails the save automatically.   Any surface the sphere rolls across or in the range of its explosion is covered in 3-inch-thick mud.

This spell enables you to broadcast a brief message, no longer than four seconds in length, to each creature within 3 miles of your location. Recipients of the message hear it in their minds and, if they know you, recognize you as the sender. Additionally, they discern your distance and direction at the time of casting. The spell ensures that creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 1 can comprehend the message's meaning. 

A sleeping creature can hear the message and may choose to awaken upon hearing it.

- **Classes:**  Ranger, Bard
___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 

This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.

Should a creature inside the web attempt to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. A successful save allows the creature to utilize its spell or ability to exit the web, while a failure causes the spell or ability to be expended without effect. Notably, this net of light also extends into the Ethereal Plane, preventing ethereal escape.

A restrained creature can take an action on its turn to attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending its restrained condition on a success.

At the end of each of your subsequent turns during the duration, the pendulum swings back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Warlock
___

You call forth a formidable creature of your choice: a **Stone Hurling Giant**, a **Madding Jabberwocky**, or a **Hungering Behemoth**. It materializes in an unoccupied space within range and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

This primitive creature is allied with you and your companions. It acts on your initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. You can telepathically communicate with the creature while you are on the same plane, and you are both aware of each other's locations. It follows your telepathic commands without requiring an action from you. If not given any commands, it automatically moves toward and attacks the nearest creature it detects.

If the creature moves more than 100 feet from you, your concentration on the spell is broken. Additionally, at the start of its turn, if the creature has taken damage since its last turn, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn't disappear but becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and you lose control over it. The uncontrolled creature cannot be dismissed by you and will disappear 1 hour after it was summoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the summoned creature gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 7th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, the spell's duration extends to 8 hours.

Guided by an astral prophecy, your sight extends beyond the present moment. Until the spell ends, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, you can end the spell prematurely, allowing the creature to roll an additional d20. This decision can be made after the original roll but before the outcome is determined. The creature then chooses which of the d20s to use for the attack roll or saving throw.

Alternatively, if an attack is made against you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can end the spell to roll a d20 and then decide whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.

If multiple effects, such as another instance of this spell or a feature like the Lucky feat, attempt to modify a single roll, they negate each other, resulting in no additional dice being rolled.

You or a willing creature you touch shifts into the Ethereal Plane, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, until the start of your next turn or until the creature chooses to return early (no action required). The spell fails and the casting is wasted if the target is already on the Ethereal Plane.

While on the Ethereal Plane, the creature can move in any direction. Moving vertically costs an extra foot of movement per foot traveled. It can perceive the plane it left, which appears in shades of gray, but cannot see anything there beyond 60 feet.

While there, the creature can only affect and be affected by creatures, objects, and effects also on the Ethereal Plane. Creatures not on the Ethereal Plane cannot perceive or interact with it unless they have a special ability that allows them to do so.

When the spell ends, the creature returns to the corresponding location on the plane it left. If that space is occupied, it is shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it was displaced.
