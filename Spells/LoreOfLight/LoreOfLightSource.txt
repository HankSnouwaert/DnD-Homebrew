## Lore of Light
This magic taps into the power of light and its <br> many aspects. Its users not only conjure literal <br> light but can ignite the light in the souls of others, <br> healing or inspiring them. Some magic from this lore <br> even blesses creatures with the ability to move at light <br> speed. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Light often wield.

#### Burning Gaze
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric
___

You fixate on two points within the spell's range, no more than 10 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of searing light erupt from your eyes, blazing between the two points. Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 radiant damage on a failed save. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6, the radiant damage increases by 1d6, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Dazzling Light
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 fee
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Bard

You unleash a burst of radiant light at a point you choose within range. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 Radiant damage and become Blinded until the end of your next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t Blinded.
 
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Holy Nova
*4th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

A burst of divine light emanates from you, enveloping all creatures within 30 feet. Each creature in this area must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 3d6 + your spell modifier radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

You and up to four creatures of your choice within the area automatically succeed on this saving throw, taking no damage. Instead, you and the chosen creatures are bathed in the healing radiance, regaining hit points equal to the total radiant damage dealt.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

#### Mass Haste
*8th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose up to six willing creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, each chosen creature has its speed doubled, gains a +2 bonus to AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and is quickened.


#### Net of Light
*5th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (A white thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Should a creature inside the web attempt to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. A successful save allows the creature to utilize its spell or ability to exit the web, while a failure causes the spell or ability to be expended without effect. Notably, this net of light also extends into the Ethereal Plane, preventing ethereal escape.

A restrained creature can take an action on its turn to attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending its restrained condition on a success.

#### Warding Light
*1st level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (sliver coin)
- **Duration:**  1 round.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin
___

You envelop a creature of your choice within range in a protective radiant light. Until the start of your next turn, the creature illuminates bright light out to a 10-foot radius and dim light out an additional 10 feet. During this time, attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage. This effect doesn't hinder attackers who don't depend on sight, such as those with blindsight or those who cannot be blinded.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. The chosen creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
