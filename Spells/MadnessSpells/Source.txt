## Madness Spells

Some spells test the limits of their caster, potentially driving them to insanity. Spells that have the **Madness** tag have a bonus effect you can choose to benefit from when casting the spell. If you chose to gain this benefit, then when the spell ends, you must roll on the Madness Table to determine what consequence you suffer from.  

A creature can automatically cure itself of one madness effect it is suffering from over a long rest. For each other madness effect the creature is still suffering from, it may make a Wisdom or Charisma save (its chooses which) against the spell save DC of the spell casting feature it used to cast the spell that resulted in that madness effect. On a successful save, that madness effect ends.

The *calm emotions* spell can suppress any ongoing madness effects a creature is suffering from, and the *remove curse*, *greater restoration*, and *dispel magic* spells can end a madness effect on a creature.

- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Paladin
___
Your weapon becomes swathed in purple light, and the next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your attack deals an extra 2d4 psychic damage. If the target creature has no allies within 5 feet of it, you deal an extra 3d4 psychic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the baseline damage and the extra damage increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

***Madness.*** The duration of the spell becomes 10 minutes. Additionally, you become invisible, and while invisible this way, you don't suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks due to armor you are wearing until the spell ends, you make a damage roll, or you force someone to make a saving throw.  The spell continues even if your invisibility ends early

#### Crown of Madness
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
One creature of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and its eyes glow with madness. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or less isn't affected.

On each of its turns, the charmed target must move up to its speed and use its action to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that you mentally choose. The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no creature. The charmed creature won't move into obviously dangerous hazards.

On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Additionally, the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of the spell on a success.

***Madness*** You can use your bonus action to maintain control over the target.

***Madness.*** If the spell is cast on yourself, you gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage, and you cannot drop concentration on the spell.
