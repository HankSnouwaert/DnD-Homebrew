## Stealth Spells


#### Toxic Coating
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** S, M (An apple seed)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:** Artificer, Druid, Ranger
___
You touch a weapon, piece of ammunition, or component of a mechanical trap, which becomes coated with venom. The next time the coated object deals piercing or slashing damage to a creature during the spell’s duration, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned this way can repeat the Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the poison damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

- **Components:** S, M 
- **Duration:** 120 feet
- **Classes:** Druid, Ranger, Warlock
___

You cause a whirlwind of vile smoke and stinging ashes to rush up at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 20-foot radius of that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d10 necrotic damage and loses any darkvision it has until the end of its next turn. On a successful save,  a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its darkvision.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. The spell also snuffs out any non-magical fire in its area.

___

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become brittle for the duration. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.
