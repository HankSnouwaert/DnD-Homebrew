## Lore of Heavens
This brand of magic draws on the power of the wilds and the animals that inhabit them. Those who practice it avoid civilization and live hermitic lives in the savage and untamed wilderness. Their magic harnesses the power of the beasts they dwell alongside, often by summoning wild spirits or unleashing the inner savagery of themselves and others to transform them into primeval creatures. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Beasts often wield.

#### Comet's Call
*5th-level evocation* (NOTE: Should this be conjuration?)
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A piece of iron or nickel ore)
- **Duration:**   1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Wizard, Sorcerer
___

You channel the winds of magic to summon a comet from the heavens to the battlefield. You select a point you can see, 300 feet above you within range, causing a blue pulse to flash in the sky. 

At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, nothing occurs. On a roll of 4-6, a 5-foot-radius comet materializes at the chosen point and immediately descends (NOTE: Can it not fall from the sky?). The comet passes through any Large or smaller creatures and objects, exploding in a 30-foot-radius sphere when it hits a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. The explosion's effects spread around corners. 

Each creature or object the comet comes in contact with, as well as those within the explosion's area, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the comet's full damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success. The comet's base damage is 5d8 fire damage plus 5d8 bludgeoning damage. Each time you roll to see if the comet appears and it doesn't, the fire and bludgeoning damage it deals each increase by 1d8. The spell ends after the comet lands.

***At Higher Levels.*** Casting this spell using a 6th-level spell slot or higher increases either the fire damage or the bludgeoning damage (your choice) by 1d8 for every slot level above 5th.

#### Curse of the Midnight Wind
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (Pinch of salt)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

A chilling wind emanates from you, affecting an area within range that can be up to 40 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall (NOTE: How does this emanate from you if it has a 150-foot range?). Up to six creatures of your choice within this area feel their fortune wane. Each targeted creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be cursed by this spell for its duration.

While cursed:
* If the creature rolls an 18 or higher on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not caused by this spell, it must reroll and take the new result.
* When another creature makes an attack against the cursed target and rolls a 3 or lower on the attack roll, the attacking creature may reroll and must use the new result.

At the end of its turn, an affected creature can attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending the curse's effect on it on a success.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Lighting Strike
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid
___

You summon a bolt of lightning to strike a point you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can summon an additional lightning bolt for each slot level above 2nd. These bolts can target the same or different points. If a creature is in the area of more than one lightning bolt, it is affected only once.

#### Ice Strom (Revised)
*4th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)
- **Duration:**  1 Round
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A barrage of rock-hard ice plummets from the sky, forming a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. The area becomes difficult terrain until the start of your next turn, and any creature within it has disadvantage on ranged attack rolls.

When the ice storm initially appears or if a creature is inside its area at the start of your next turn, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, both the bludgeoning and cold damage increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Wind Blast
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A legume seed)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You summon a powerful gust of wind emanating from a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range and blasting out in the direction of your choice. Medium or smaller objects in this area that aren't secured and aren't being worn or carried are pushed up to 20 feet in the chosen direction. Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed in the chosen direction and knocked prone. The wind also disperses gas and vapor and extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in its area.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the wind pushes creatures and objects an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Harmonic Convergence
*1st-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V S M (A piece of string)
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:**   Bard, Cleric, Druid
___

Divining auspicious omens, you grant a creature you can see within range a brief insight into the immediate future. Until the start of your next turn, if the chosen creature misses with an attack roll or fails a Dexterity saving throw, it can end the spell early to reroll the d20 and must use the new result. Similarly, when an attack roll is made against the chosen creature, it can end the spell early to force the attacker to reroll the d20, and the attacker must use the new result.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

#### Second Sight 
*2nd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

Guided by an astral prophecy, your sight extends beyond the present moment. Until the spell ends, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, you can end the spell prematurely, allowing the creature to roll an additional d20. This decision can be made after the original roll but before the outcome is determined. The creature then chooses which of the d20s to use for the attack roll or saving throw.

Alternatively, if an attack is made against you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can end the spell to roll a d20 and then decide whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.

If multiple effects, such as another instance of this spell or a feature like the Lucky feat, attempt to modify a single roll, they negate each other, resulting in no additional dice being rolled.
