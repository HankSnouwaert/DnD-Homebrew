# Smith's Tools
Smith’s tools allow you to work metal, heating it to
alter its shape, repair damage, or work raw ingots into
useful items.  Smith's tools include hammers, tongs, charcoal, rags, and a whetstone. 

Having proficiency in smith's tools allows you to forge a variety of different types of weapons, armor, and other metal objects.  Unless stated otherwise, crafting these items requires access not only to your tools, but to an open flame hot enough to make metal pliable as well as an anvil.

As your proficiency bonus increases, so does your mastery with your tools.  There are five tiers of experience tied to the proficiency bonus you have with your tools.  At each tier, your capabilities with the tool increase, and you learn new crafting methods.  For the purposes of tool use and crafting, these proficiency levels are referred to as Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, Master, and Legend. If a character has expertise in a tool, their Proficiency Level with that tool is twice their Prof. Bonus, maxing out at Legend.

#### Labor Cost
If none of the player characters in your party have proficiency with smith's tools, they may be able to find an NPC with this skill.  NPCs with higher Proficiency Levels will generally be harder to find, and at the DM's discretion, the players may have to travel to large cities or remote locations to find especially skilled artisans.

The payment required for the services of a smith is dependent on the skill level of the NPC and how many hours they are being hired for.  See the table below for the hourly cost of a smith based on their proficiency. 

##### Proficiency Levels and Labor Costs
| Proficiency Level |  Prof. Bonus  | Level Range| Labor Cost <br> (gp per hr.)
|:-----------------:|:-------------:| :---------:| :-----------------:|
|  Apprentice       |      +2       |     1-4    |  4 |
|  Journeyman       |      +3       |     5-8    |  12 |
|  Expert           |      +4       |     9-12   |  28 |
|  Master           |      +5       |    13-16   |  60 |
|  Legend           |      +6       |    17-20   |  120 |

#### Crafting Magic Items

If you are using the rules for crafting magic items, proficiency with Smith's Tools allows you to use ingredients to forge magic items made of metal.  Magic items have recipes that describe how they can be crafted.  As your proficiency in Smith's Tools increases, you can learn recipes for different magic items, choosing from a list of options presented at each tier of proficiency.  At the DM's discretion, you may be able to learn other recipes through research, learning from other craftsmen, or as uncovered knowledge during your adventures.  

The details of the recipes listed here can be found at the end of this document, along with descriptions for the items not found in the DMG.

### Metal Repair
With access to your tools and an open flame hot enough to make metal pliable, you can restore 10 hit points to a damaged metal object for each hour of work.

### Forging Metal Items
With access to your tools and an open flame hot enough to make metal pliable, you can forge mundane items made primarily out of metal.  Forging the item requires metal ingredients or crafting supplies worth at least 80% of the item’s total market value.  

If the item is a pole weapon such as a spear or a weapon with the Reach property, half the metal ingredients may be substituted with wood or bone ingredients.  If ingredients are being used, no more than 10 may be used to craft the item.  Crafting the item requires a number of work hours equal to the item's market value divided by 10 (rounded up).

For every hour that you work on the item, subtract from the remaining hours a number of hours equal to your proficiency modifier.  You may have up to one other individual with proficiency in Smith’s Tools assist you in the item’s creation.  When working together, combine both your proficiency modifiers when subtracting from the remaining hours.

> ##### Ingredients and Crafting Supplies
> Ingredients and crafting supplies are explained in more detail in the Custom Crafting document.  If you're not using ingredients in your adventures, you can just assume metal and wood ingredients are any items you find made of that material with a significant gold value.  
Crafting supplies just represent generic supplies, such as metal ingots or lumber, that you can buy from a vendor.

### Whetstones
As part of your smith's training, you know how to make magical whetstones that can be used to temporarily enhance a melee weapon.  These whetstones can only be used once, afterwards they crumble into dust.  As your proficiency increases, you learn to create more types of whetstones.  The different types of whetstones you can create are listed later in this document.

### Secrets of Metal: <br> True Silver and Cold Iron
You've learned the specialized training needed to work with either true silver or cold iron metals.  When you become an apprentice, pick one of those two metals.  You can now craft weapons, armor, shields out of that metal.  Any item made from one of these metals is worth 200gp more than its normal version.   True silver and cold iron cannot be combined in a single item.

\pagebreakNum


##### True Silver
Silvered items are known for their effectiveness against devils and lycanthropes.  However, crafting silver into an item while maintaining its utility is a delicate process requiring specialized training.  

Creatures bound with shackles made of true silver cannot shape shift unless they pass a DC 16 Strength Saving throw.  This save can be repeated once per day.

**Weapons.** Attacks made with silvered weapons overcome any damage resistances or immunities possessed by devils and lycanthropes.  A shapeshifter struck by a silvered weapon must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or revert to its true form and be unable to shapeshift until the start of your next turn.

**Armor.**  While wearing silvered armor, you have resistance to damage the from natural weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities possessed by devils and lycanthropes.

**Shields.** If you are wearing a silvered shield you are proficient with, taking a dodge action gives you advantage on all saving throws caused by devils and lycanthropes until the start of your next turn.

##### Cold Iron
Cold Iron items are known for their effectiveness against fey and demons.  

Cold iron items are not crafted using an open flame, making them extremely difficult to craft.  

Creatures bound with shackles made of cold iron cannot turn invisible or teleport unless they pass a DC 16 Strength Saving throw.  This save can be repeated once per day.

**Weapons.** Attacks made with cold iron weapons overcome any damage resistances or immunities possessed by demons and fey.  A creature struck by a cold iron weapon must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or or be unable to turn invisible or teleport until the start of your next turn.

**Armor.**  While wearing cold iron armor, you have resistance to damage the from natural weapons, spells, and spell-like abilities possessed by demons and fey.

**Shields.** If you are wearing a cold iron shield you are proficient with, taking a dodge action gives you advantage on all saving throws caused by demons and fey until the start of your next turn.

### Harvesting
You can apply your proficiency with smith's tools to checks made to harvest metal from creatures made primarily of metal (such as **iron golems**).

### Secrets of Magical Metal: Adamantine and Mithril
You've learned the specialized training needed to work with either mithral or adamantine metals.  When you become a journeyman, pick one of those two metals.  You can now craft weapons, armor, shields out of that metal.  Any item made from one of these metals is worth 500gp more than its normal version.   Adamantine and mithral cannot be combined in a single item.

##### Adamantine
An extremely dense and robust metal favored by dwarves.  Adamantine confers the following attributes to items.

**Weapons.** Attacks made with adamantine weapons against objects or structures automatically score a critical hit. See *Xanathar's Guide to Everything* pg.78 for rules on adamantine weapons.

**Armor.**  While wearing adamantine armor, critical hits against you become normal hits.  See the *Dungeon Master's Guide* pg.150 for more information.

**Shields.** If you are wearing a shield made of adamantine and you are proficient with it, you can use it to make an off hand attack for 1d6 + your Strength Modifer worth of bludgeoning damage.  A strike with this attack against an object or structure automatically scores a critical hit.

##### Mithral
An extremely light and malleable metal favored by elves.  Mithral confers the following attributes to items.

**Weapons.** Mithral weapons with the Heavy property lose the Heavy property.  Mithral weapons without the Heavy property gain the Thrown property with a range of (15/30).  If the weapon has the Light property, this range increases to (20/60).  If the weapon already has the Thrown property, its range increases by (+10/+20).  

**Armor.** If armor would normally impose disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, the mithral version does not.  See the *Dungeon Master's Guide* pg.182 for more information.

**Shields.** Mithral shields can be equipped and unequipped as an object interaction rather than an action.  If you have proficiency with shields, you may also attack with it as though it were a Light Hammer.  If you throw the shield and it doesn't have some way to automatically return to you, you lose its AC bonus until you equip it again.

> ##### Magic Metals in Crafting
> Any item crafted with adamantine or mithral is considered magical.  When you find metal items and ingredients during your adventures, it is up to the DM whether or not they are composed of one of these magical metals.  
In the case of ingredients, this does not effect its other properties or how much it contributes to Supply Cost of an item being crafted with it.  Any item crafted with any amount of a special metal, gains the property of that metal.  Gaining that property does not count against the number of magical effects that item has.

\pagebreakNum

## Expert (Prof. 4)
As an expert, you are now accustomed to working rare, supernatural metals.  If you are using the Custom Crafting rules, you gain access to the Expert level effects available to smiths.  You also know the following skills.

### Expert Smith's Recipes
As an expert, you learn more advanced item crafting techniques.  Choose a number of recipes from the following list equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).  You now know the recipes for those items as a part of your smith's training.

### Energy Mastery
As you become an expert smith, you also gain expertise in working with a specific type of magical energy.  Choose one of the following energy types to gain mastery of. 

* Fire
* Water
* Earth
* Air
* Fey
* Shadow
* Celestial
* Fiendish
* Orderly
* Chaotic
* Primeval
* Psychic

Whenever you use an ingredient with this energy property in a crafting recipe, the ingredient's energy property contributes double to the recipe's energy requirements.  

For example, if you chose to gain expertise fire energy and you are using a recipe which requires two rare ingredients with the fire property, than one rare ingredient with the fire property will meet this requirement.  

Note that this does not cause the ingredient to count doubly towards any other requirements.

\pagebreakNum

### Mystic Metallurgy
As a master, you now have the ability to melt down and divide magical metals.  You can melt down an ingredient of one rarity into multiple ingredients of a lower rarity.  The ingredients yielded in this division retain their material and energy properties.

When melting down a metal, you can choose to do a major division or a minor division, each of which yields ingredients of differing quantity and quality as shown in the table below.  

Ingredients resulting from the split, cannot be further split.

 ##### Metal Division Yields
| Metal Rarity |  Minor Division <br> Yield | Major Division <br> Yield  | 
|:------------:|:---------:|:---------:| 
|  Mundane     |  2 Poor   | None      |
|  Common      |  5 Mundane| 10 Poor   |

### Artifact Crafting
As a legendary smith, you now have the ability to forge an equally legendary artifact that can last through the ages.  An artifact must be created using the custom crafting rules as it's design is uniquely your own.  

An artifact must incorporate an ingredient of mythic rarity into its crafting and have a gp value of at least 100,000 gp.  

Other than this requirement, it is up to the crafter to determine if the forged item will be an artifact or not.  The DM may also require the player to undergo a specific quest or craft the item in a specific way or at a special location in order to create an artifact.  

Once an artifact is forged, it has the following properties

#### Special Means of Destruction
The artifact can only be destroyed in a specific way determined by its creator.  This is something the player should work with the DM to determine. Below are some examples.

##### Example Methods of Destruction:
* Cast into the volcano where the artifact was forged
* Can only be destroyed by a certain type of creature, such as a **terrasque**
* Can only be destroyed during a once in a century cosmic event that occurred at the time of its creation
* Can only be destroyed by the closest living relative of its creator
* By completing a herculean quest, such as freeing a soul from the bottom lair of the Nine Hells

#### A Will of Its Own
The artifact posses some level of sentience.  Its alignment matches that of its creator at the time of its forging, and the creator determines the way in which way it can communicate with others.  Its creator may also imbue the item with a special purpose at the time of its creation.  See pages 214 and 216 of the DMG for examples of how an item can communicate with others and what special purposes it might have, as well as what can happen if it comes into conflict with its owner.

#### Unique Attunement
Artifacts always require attunement, and they often have special requirements for their attunement.  At the time of its creation, the crafter may determine the means by which someone can attune to the artifact.  This often requires having the same alignment as the artifact, but attunement can also be more involved.

##### Example Attunement Requirements
* Must be of a certain race
* Must share the item's purpose
* Must attune after slaying a certain type of creature
* Must attune during a certain time of day
* Must complete a quest dictated by the item

# Smith Crafting
Smith's tools can be used to craft magic items using magical ingredients that adventure's find during their adventures.  These items can be crafted by following specific recipes or by crafting custom items with a combination of magical effects.  This section describes the different items and recipes specifically available to smiths.  For information on custom item crafting, see the Custom Crafting document.


#### Ingredients
Ingredients are magical materials that players find and harvest during their adventures.  Though they can come in many forms, for the purposes of crafting, the three descriptors that matter are: 

* <b>Rarity:</b> Determines the value in terms of gp
* <b>Material:</b> Determines how it can be used by different tools
* <b>Energy:</b> Different item effects require specific energies

No more than 10 Ingredients can be used at a time when crafting an item. For more information on these properties and harvesting Ingredients in general, see <b> Part 1 </b> of the Custom Crafting Document.

#### Crafting Supplies
Crafting Supplies refer to anything with a gp value that contributes towards the magic item's creation.  Every recipe has a Supply Cost, representing the gp value worth of Crafting Supplies that must be included in the item's creation.  

Crafting Supplies can include any magic Ingredients that are usable by the artisan's tools being used to create the item. They can also include more abstract tools and reagents that can be purchased from vendors in larger towns and cities. Crafting Supplies bought this way are not considered to be magical Ingredients, and the DM may rule that a particular settlement does not have the means to provide such magical Crafting Supplies to players.  

Additionally, if the item being crafted is a magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor, the non-magical equivalent item, or enough supplies to create it, must be provided.  This is in addition to the Supply Costs dictated by the magic effect recipes.

All Crafting Supplies used in an item's creation are consumed once the item is completed.

#### Substituting Ingredients 
Magic effect recipes specify requirements for specific types of Ingredients at specific rarities.  When crafting, you may substitute a required Ingredient with a number of lesser Ingredients that have the same required properties and at least the same combined value in gp.
* For example, a requirement for an Uncommon Metal could be met with two Common Metal

* A requirement for an Uncommon Ingredient with Fire Energy could be met with two Common Ingredients that both have Fire Energy

Additionally, an Ingredient of greater value can replace a number of Ingredients with the same properties as it that are equal to or less than its gp value.
* For example, one Rare Fire Metal used in a recipe would be equivalent to using five Uncommon Fire Metals

<div class='classTable wide'>

##### Ingredient Exchange Rates
| Rarity | Poor | Mundane | Common | Uncommon | Rare | Very Rare | Epic | Legendary | Mythic | 
|:---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Poor  | 1 | 1/2 | 1/10 | 1/20 | 1/100 | 1/200 | 1/1000 | 1/2000 | 1/10000 | 
| Mundane | 2 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/500 | 1/1000 | 1/5000 | 
| Common | 10 | 5 | 1 | 1/2 | 1/10 | 1/20 | 1/100 | 1/200 | 1/1000 | 
| Uncommon| 20 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/500 | 
| Rare   | 100 | 50 | 10 | 5 | 1 | 1/2 | 1/10 | 1/20 | 1/100 | 
| Very Rare| 200 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/50 |

## Whetstones

Magical whetstones can be used to enhance a melee weapon or weapon with the thrown property by either sliding it along its edge or crushing it against its surface, causing the whetstone to crumble to dust as its magic passes to the weapon.  

An attack made with a weapon enhanced by a whetstone applies an additional magic effect to the weapon attack.  This magical effect is determined by the type of whetstone and occurs in addition to effects of the weapon's normal attack.

#### Material Types

The primary materials for creating whetstones are gems, metals, and stones.  When creating a whetstone, you must chose which of these materials will be the stone's primary material, which will make in the most important type of ingredient needed for crafting. Other types of materials can used to aid in the whetstone's crafting unless they are one of the invalid material types listed below.

**Primary Whetstone Materials:** Gem, Metal, Stone

**Invalid Whetstone Materials:** Bone, Cloth, Hide, Parchment, Wood


#### Crafting Time
The time it takes to craft any item is dependent of the skill of the crafters.  The Base Crafting Time is a baseline for how many working hours it will take to craft an item, and is shown in the <b>Crafting Time</b> table below.  However, the actual crafting time is dependent on the Proficiency Level of the crafter.  For each hour spent working on the item, subtract a number of hours equal to the crafter’s Prof. Bonus from the Base Crafting Time. Subtract twice their Prof. Bonus if they have expertise in the tool.  When the Base Crafting Time reaches zero, the item is complete.

A character may spend up to 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week working on an item.  Two characters with the relevant tool proficiencies can work on together on an item to add their Prof. Bonuses and speed up crafting. 

The crafting can also be started before you have all your Crafting Supplies.  You can complete a percentage of your crafting equal to the percentage of the Crafting Supplies you have provided.  For example, if your item requires 300gp worth of Crafting Supplies, and you have 200gp worth of Crafting Supplies, you can complete up to two thirds of the crafting.  

##### Crafting Time
| Whetstone Level | Base Crafting Time  (Hrs.)  | 
|:-----------------:|:-------------:| 
|  Apprentice       |      5       | 
|  Journeyman       |      8       |

## Whetstone Recipes
This section provides the descriptions of the different whetstone crafting recipes. Each description contains a recipe and often a description of how the more powerful versions of the whetstone can be created.

#### Recipe
The recipe lists the required gp value of Crafting Supplies and what types of Ingredients are needed to craft the whetstone.  Most recipes include requirements for: 
* Crafting Supplies equal to a certain amount of gp
* Ingredients with of the Primary Material.  
* Ingredients with a specific Magic Energy.  

These requirements are independent of each other and can be met separately with the same Ingredients.

##### Recipe Example
Assume a smith is making an Acidic Stone, which has the following recipe
___
- **Recipe:** 160gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 Uncommon Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 1 Common Ingredient with Fiendish, Primeval or Water Energy

If you decide to make your whetstone out of metal, the Primary Material would be metal.  If the smith used an Uncommon Metal with the Fire property (worth 100gp), this would meet the Primary Material requirement and pay for 100gp of the 160gp Crafting Supply requirement.  If the smith then provided a Common Liquid with the Primeval property (worth 50gp), this would satisfy Energy requirement and leave 10gp left that would need to be paid for using other purchasable Crafting Supplies.

Alternatively, if the smith has an Uncommon Metal with the Primeval property, that could be used to simultaneously meet the requirement for the Primary Material and the needed Energy.  The remaining 60gp worth of needed Crafting Supplies could then be met using gold to purchase supplies.

#### Higher Ranks
Most whetstones can be crafted at higher ranks, boosting their potency.  When crafting a whetstone at a higher rank, the recipe for that rank replaces base recipe entirely.

The recipes for the different ranks are listed in an abbreviated format.

\columnbreak

### Whetstone Descriptions
The whetstones are presented here in alphabetical order.

#### Acidic Stone
*Apprentice*
___
- **Recipe:**  180gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 Uncommon Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 1 Common Ingredient with Fiendish, Primeval, or Water Energy
___

This whetstone is infused with acidic energy.  Its effect lasts for 1 minute or until an attack is made with the enhanced weapon. 

After hitting a creature with an attack using the enhanced weapon, the target is sprayed with acid, causing it to take an additional 2d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the target is splashed with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

At higher ranks, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 per rank.

**At Higher Levels:**

- **Recipe:**  500gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 3 Uncommon Ingredients of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 1 Uncommon Ingredient with Fiendish or Shadow Energy
___

This whetstone infuses weapons with the ability to drain the life of their victims. Its effect lasts for 1 minute or until a successful attack is made with the enhanced weapon.

\pagebreakNum

After hitting a creature with an attack using the enhanced weapon, if the target is not a construct or undead, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a non magical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

___

This whetstone is infused with planar magic.  Its effect lasts for 1 minute or until the weapon is used to make a successful attack. 

\pagebreakNum

After hitting a creature with an attack using the enhanced weapon, your weapon crackles with force, and the attack deals an extra 5d10 force damage to the target.

Additionally, if this attack reduces the target to 50 hit points of fewer, you banish it. If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you’re on, the target disappears, returning to its home plane. If the target is native to the plane you’re on, the creature vanishes into a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. It remains there for 1 minute, at which point the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.

#### Chaos Stone
*Apprentice*
___
- **Recipe:**  90gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 Common Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 2 Mundane Ingredient with Chaotic Energy
___

This whetstone is infused with elemental chaos.  Its effect lasts for 1 minute or until the weapon is used to make a successful attack. 

After hitting with a melee attack with the enhanced weapon, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

| d8 |  Damage Type  | 
|:--:|:-------------:|
| 1  |      Acid     |
| 2  |      Cold     | 
| 3  |      Fire     |
| 4  |      Force    |
| 5  |      Lightning|
| 6  |      Poison   |
| 7  |      Psychic  |
| 8  |      Thunder  |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by each use of this effect. 

At higher levels, the enhanced weapon deals an additional 1d6 damage of type rolled per additional level.

___

This whetstone can enhance your weapon with the ability to deliver a terrible curse to its target.  Its effect lasts for 1 minute or until an attack is made with the enhanced weapon. When you use it to enhance your weapon, choose the nature of the curse from the following option:

* Choose one ability score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving throws made with that ability score.
* While cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
* While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that turn doing nothing.
* While the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target.

The curse lasts for 1 minute. A *remove curse* ends the effect on the creature.  At the DM's option, you may choose an alternative curse effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM has final say on such a curse's effect.


At higher ranks, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 per rank.

#### Freezing Stone
*Apprentice*
___
- **Recipe:**  80gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 Common Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 1 Mundane Ingredient with Water Energy
___

This whetstone is infused with icy power.  Its effect lasts for one minute or until the weapon is used to make a successful attack. 

After hitting a creature with melee attack using the enhanced weapon, the target must make a DC 13 Strength save or be rooted to the ground and restrained by ice for 1 minute.  A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving throw.  If the target succeeds on this save, the ice melts away.  

While restrained by this effect, the target takes 1d6 cold damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature restrained by the ice or one that can touch the creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check. On a success, the target is freed.
