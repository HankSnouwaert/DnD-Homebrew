# Carver's Tools
The Players Handbook contains a description for Woodcarver's tools, which players can gain proficiency in.  This document refers to these tools as Carver's Tools as they can also be used to work wood, bone, and stone. These materials can be crafted into intricate and useful objects such as weapons, ammunition, and figurines.  Carver's Tools includes a knife, a gouge, a small saw, and sometimes a small mallet and chisel. 

As your proficiency bonus increases, so does your mastery with your tools.  There are five tiers of experience tied to the proficiency bonus you have with your tools.  At each tier, your capabilities with the tool increase, and you learn new crafting methods.  For the purposes of tool use and crafting, these proficiency levels are referred to as Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, Master, and Legend. If a character has expertise in a tool, their Proficiency Level with that tool is twice their Prof. Bonus, maxing out at Legend.

#### Labor Cost
If none of the player characters in your party have proficiency with carver's tools, they may be able to find an NPC with this skill.  NPCs with higher Proficiency Levels will generally be harder to find, and at the DM's discretion, the players may have to travel to large cities or remote locations to find especially skilled artisans.

The payment required for the services of a carver is dependent on the skill level of the NPC and how many hours they are being hired for.  See the table below for the hourly cost of a carver based on their proficiency. 

##### Proficiency Levels and Labor Costs
| Proficiency Level |  Prof. Bonus  | Level Range| Labor Cost <br> (gp per hr.)
|:-----------------:|:-------------:| :---------:| :-----------------:|
|  Apprentice       |      +2       |     1-4    |  4 |
|  Journeyman       |      +3       |     5-8    |  12 |
|  Expert           |      +4       |     9-12   |  28 |
|  Master           |      +5       |    13-16   |  60 |
|  Legend           |      +6       |    17-20   |  120 |

#### Crafting Magic Items

If you are using the rules for crafting magic items, proficiency with carver's tools allows you to use ingredients to forge magic items made of bone, stone, and wood.  Magic items have recipes that describe how they can be crafted.  As your proficiency in carver's tools increases, you can learn recipes for different magic items, choosing from a list of options presented at each tier of proficiency.  At the DM's discretion, you may be able to learn other recipes through research, learning from other craftsmen, or as uncovered knowledge during your adventures.  

The details of the recipes listed here can be found at the end of this document, along with descriptions for the items not found in the DMG.

### Wood Repair
With access to your tools you can restore 10 hit points to a damaged wood, stone, or bone object for each hour of work.

### Carving Items
With access to your tools, you can craft mundane items made primarily out of bone, stone, or wood.  Crafting the item requires bone, stone, or wood ingredients (depending on what the item will be made of) or crafting supplies worth at least 80% of the item’s total market value.  

If the item is a pole weapon such as a spear or a weapon with the Reach property, half the ingredients may be substituted with metal ingredients.  If ingredients are being used, no more than 10 may be used to craft the item.  Crafting the item requires a number of work hours equal to the item's market value divided by 10 (rounded up).

For every hour that you work on the item, subtract from the remaining hours a number of hours equal to your proficiency modifier.  You may have up to one other individual with proficiency in Carver’s Tools assist you in the item’s creation.  When working together, combine both your proficiency modifiers when subtracting from the remaining hours.

> ##### Ingredients and Crafting Supplies
> Ingredients and crafting supplies are explained in more detail in the Custom Crafting document.  If you're not using ingredients in your adventures, you can just assume metal and wood ingredients are any items you find made of that material with a significant gold value.  
Crafting supplies just represent generic supplies, such as metal ingots or lumber, that you can buy from a vendor.

### Arrows
As part of your carver's training, you know how to make magical arrows that produce special effects on hit.  These arrows can only be used once, afterwards they crumble into dust.  As your proficiency increases, you learn to create more types of arrows.  The different types of arrows you can create are listed later in this document.

### Harvesting
You can apply your proficiency with carver's tools to checks made to harvest wood from creatures made primarily of wood (such as **treants**) or stone from creatures primarily made of stone (such as **stone golems**).

## Journeyman (Prof. 3)
As a journeyman, you have advanced in your skill to the point where you've learned more sophisticated carving techniques.  If you are using the Custom Crafting rules, you gain access to the Journeyman level effects available to smiths.  You also know the following skills.

### Material Specialization
You've learned specialized techniques for working with one of the following materials: bone, stone, wood.  You learn one of the following techniques corresponding to the material you specialized in.

##### Bone: Skeletal Harvester
You've learned the techniques necessary for harvesting bone from dead creatures.  You can apply your proficiency with carvers tools to checks made to harvest bone from creatures.  If you already have proficiency on the harvesting check from another source, double your proficiency for that check.

##### Stone: Rapid Petrification
You learn a special technique for quickly fossilizing organic material.  Over the course of a long rest, you can petrify organic ingredients such as flesh, bone, plant, and wood.  Doing so requires reagents worth at least 1/10 the value of the ingredient being petrified.  These regents can be purchased alchemical goods or other stone ingredients.

##### Wood: Reusable Shavings
You learn how to prevent any spare scraps of wood from going to waste.  Whenever you craft an item primarily made out of wood, you generate a leftover wooden ingredient.  This ingredient has a rarity two ranks lower than the most expensive wood ingredient used to the craft the item, and it also share's that ingredient's energy type.

### Journeyman Carver's Recipes
As a journeyman, you learn more advanced item crafting techniques.  Choose a number of recipes from the following list equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).  You now know the recipes for those items as a part of your carver's training.

### Expert Carver's Recipes
As an expert, you learn more advanced item crafting techniques.  Choose a number of recipes from the following list equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).  You now know the recipes for those items as a part of your carver's training. 

The recipes for these items can be found at the end of the document.

* +2 Weapon
* Animated Shield
* Armor of Resistance
* Arrow Catching Shield

### Energy Mastery
As you become an expert carver, you also gain expertise in working with a specific type of magical energy.  Choose one of the following energy types to gain mastery of. 

* Fire
* Water
* Earth
* Air
* Fey
* Shadow
* Celestial
* Fiendish
* Orderly
* Chaotic
* Primeval
* Psychic

Whenever you use an ingredient with this energy property in a crafting recipe, the ingredient's energy property contributes double to the recipe's energy requirements.  

For example, if you chose to gain expertise in fire energy and you are using a recipe which requires two rare ingredients with the fire property, than one rare ingredient with the fire property will meet this requirement.  

Note that this does not cause the ingredient to count doubly towards any other requirements.

\pagebreakNum

### Mystic Carving
As a master, you now have the ability to split down ingredients of the material you specialized in as a Journeyman.  You can split down one ingredient of your specialized material type down into multiple ingredients of a lower rarity.  The ingredients yielded in this division retain their material and energy properties.

When splitting down an ingredient, you can choose to do a major division or a minor division, each of which yields ingredients of differing quantity and quality as shown in the table below.  

Ingredients resulting from the split, cannot be further split.

 ##### Material Division Yields
| Material Rarity |  Minor Division <br> Yield | Major Division <br> Yield  | 
|:------------:|:---------:|:---------:| 
|  Mundane     |  2 Poor   | None      |

### Artifact Crafting
As a legendary smith, you now have the ability to forge an equally legendary artifact that can last through the ages.  An artifact must be created using the custom crafting rules as it's design is uniquely your own.  

An artifact must incorporate an ingredient of mythic rarity into its crafting and have a gp value of at least 100,000 gp.  

Other than this requirement, it is up to the crafter to determine if the forged item will be an artifact or not.  The DM may also require the player to undergo a specific quest or craft the item in a specific way or at a special location in order to create an artifact.  

Once an artifact is forged, it has the following properties

#### Special Means of Destruction
The artifact can only be destroyed in a specific way determined by its creator.  This is something the player should work with the DM to determine. Below are some examples.

##### Example Methods of Destruction:
* Cast into the volcano where the artifact was forged
* Can only be destroyed by a certain type of creature, such as a terrasque
* Can only be destroyed during a once in a century cosmic event that occurred at the time of its creation
* Can only be destroyed by the closest living relative of its creator
* By completing a herculean quest, such as freeing a soul from the bottom lair of the Nine Hells

#### A Will of Its Own
The artifact posses some level of sentience.  Its alignment matches that of its creator at the time of its forging, and the creator determines the way in which way it can communicate with others.  Its creator may also imbue the item with a special purpose at the time of its creation.  See pages 214 and 216 of the DMG for examples of how an item can communicate with others and what special purposes it might have, as well as what can happen if it comes into conflict with its owner.

#### Unique Attunement
Artifacts always require attunement, and they often have special requirements for their attunement.  At the time of its creation, the crafter may determine the means by which someone can attune to the artifact.  This often requires having the same alignment as the artifact, but attunement can also be more involved.

##### Example Attunement Requirements
* Must be of a certain race
* Must share the item's purpose
* Must attune after slaying a certain type of creature
* Must attune during a certain time of day
* Must complete a quest dictated by the item

# Carver Crafting
Carver's tools can be used to craft magic items using magical ingredients that adventure's find during their adventures.  These items can be crafted by following specific recipes or by crafting custom items with a combination of magical effects.  This section describes the different items and recipes specifically available to smiths.  For information on custom item crafting, see the Custom Crafting document.


#### Ingredients
Ingredients are magical materials that players find and harvest during their adventures.  Though they can come in many forms, for the purposes of crafting, the three descriptors that matter are: 

* <b>Rarity:</b> Determines the value in terms of gp
* <b>Material:</b> Determines how it can be used by different tools
* <b>Energy:</b> Different item effects require specific energies

No more than 10 Ingredients can be used at a time when crafting an item. For more information on these properties and harvesting Ingredients in general, see <b> Part 1 </b> of the Custom Crafting Document.

#### Crafting Supplies
Crafting Supplies refer to anything with a gp value that contributes towards the magic item's creation.  Every recipe has a Supply Cost, representing the gp value worth of Crafting Supplies that must be included in the item's creation.  

Crafting Supplies can include any magic Ingredients that are usable by the artisan's tools being used to create the item. They can also include more abstract tools and reagents that can be purchased from vendors in larger towns and cities. Crafting Supplies bought this way are not considered to be magical Ingredients, and the DM may rule that a particular settlement does not have the means to provide such magical Crafting Supplies to players.  

Additionally, if the item being crafted is a magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor, the non-magical equivalent item, or enough supplies to create it, must be provided.  This is in addition to the Supply Costs dictated by the magic effect recipes.

All Crafting Supplies used in an item's creation are consumed once the item is completed.

#### Substituting Ingredients 
Magic effect recipes specify requirements for specific types of Ingredients at specific rarities.  When crafting, you may substitute a required Ingredient with a number of lesser Ingredients that have the same required properties and at least the same combined value in gp.
* For example, a requirement for an Uncommon Wood could be met with two Common Metal

* A requirement for an Uncommon Ingredient with Fire Energy could be met with two Common Ingredients that both have Fire Energy

Additionally, an Ingredient of greater value can replace a number of Ingredients with the same properties as it that are equal to or less than its gp value.
* For example, one Rare Fire Wood used in a recipe would be equivalent to using five Uncommon Fire Metals

<div class='classTable wide'>

##### Ingredient Exchange Rates
| Rarity | Poor | Mundane | Common | Uncommon | Rare | Very Rare | Epic | Legendary | Mythic | 
|:---: |:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Poor  | 1 | 1/2 | 1/10 | 1/20 | 1/100 | 1/200 | 1/1000 | 1/2000 | 1/10000 | 
| Mundane | 2 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/500 | 1/1000 | 1/5000 | 
| Common | 10 | 5 | 1 | 1/2 | 1/10 | 1/20 | 1/100 | 1/200 | 1/1000 | 
| Uncommon| 20 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 1/100 | 1/500 | 
| Rare   | 100 | 50 | 10 | 5 | 1 | 1/2 | 1/10 | 1/20 | 1/100 | 
| Very Rare| 200 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 1/5 | 1/10 | 1/50 | 
| Epic   | 1,000 | 500 | 100 | 50 | 10 | 5 | 1 | 1/2 | 1/10 | 
| Legendary| 2,000 | 1,000 | 200 | 100 | 20 | 10 | 2 | 1 | 1/5 |

## Magic Arrows

Magical arrows possess a built in magic effect that is triggered after using them to make a successful ranged weapon attack.  When you fire the arrow, you designate its target.  The target is generally a creature or object, but if the arrow unleashes a magical effect with an area of effect, the target could be an empty space.  Once the arrow strikes its target, the magic effect is triggered and the arrow is destroyed.

If the target is a creature or object, and the arrow misses, the magical effect will not trigger unless its description says otherwise.  In this case, the arrow may not be destroyed, and at the DM's discretion, the player may be able to recover it for later use.

Magic arrows are inert until they are activated as part of a ranged weapon attack.  No more than one magic arrow can be activated per turn.

#### Material Types

The primary materials for creating arrows are bone, metals, stones, and wood.  When creating a whetstone, you must chose which of these materials will be the stone's primary material, which will make in the most important type of ingredient needed for crafting. Other types of materials can used to aid in the whetstone's crafting unless they are one of the invalid material types listed below.

**Primary Whetstone Materials:** Bone, Metal, Stone, Wood

**Invalid Whetstone Materials:** Cloth, Flesh, Hide, Parchment, Plant, Wood


#### Crafting Time
The time it takes to craft any item is dependent of the skill of the crafters.  The Base Crafting Time is a baseline for how many working hours it will take to craft an item, and is shown in the <b>Crafting Time</b> table below.  However, the actual crafting time is dependent on the Proficiency Level of the crafter.  For each hour spent working on the item, subtract a number of hours equal to the crafter’s Prof. Bonus from the Base Crafting Time. Subtract twice their Prof. Bonus if they have expertise in the tool.  When the Base Crafting Time reaches zero, the item is complete.

A character may spend up to 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week working on an item.  Two characters with the relevant tool proficiencies can work on together on an item to add their Prof. Bonuses and speed up crafting. 

The crafting can also be started before you have all your Crafting Supplies.  You can complete a percentage of your crafting equal to the percentage of the Crafting Supplies you have provided.  For example, if your item requires 300gp worth of Crafting Supplies, and you have 200gp worth of Crafting Supplies, you can complete up to two thirds of the crafting.  

##### Crafting Time
| Arrow Level | Base Crafting Time  (Hrs.)  | 
|:-----------------:|:-------------:| 
|  Apprentice       |      5       | 
|  Journeyman       |      8       |  
|  Expert           |      10      | 
|  Master           |      12      |

## Arrow Recipes
This section provides the descriptions of the different magic arrow crafting recipes. Each description contains a recipe and often a description of how the more powerful versions of the arrow can be created.

#### Recipe
The recipe lists the required gp value of Crafting Supplies and what types of Ingredients are needed to craft the arrow.  Most recipes include requirements for: 
* Crafting Supplies equal to a certain amount of gp
* Ingredients with of the Primary Material.  
* Ingredients with a specific Magic Energy.  

These requirements are independent of each other and can be met separately with the same Ingredients.

##### Recipe Example
Assume a carver is making an Acidic Arrow, which has the following recipe
___
- **Recipe:** 160gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 Uncommon Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 1 Common Ingredient with Fiendish, Primeval or Water Energy

If you decide to make your arrow out of wood, the Primary Material would be wood.  If the cover used an Uncommon Wood with the Fire property (worth 100gp), this would meet the Primary Material requirement and pay for 100gp of the 160gp Crafting Supply requirement.  If the carver then provided a Common Liquid with the Primeval property (worth 50gp), this would satisfy Energy requirement and leave 10gp left that would need to be paid for using other purchasable Crafting Supplies.

Alternatively, if the smith has an Uncommon Wood with the Primeval property, that could be used to simultaneously meet the requirement for the Primary Material and the needed Energy.  The remaining 60gp worth of needed Crafting Supplies could then be met using gold to purchase supplies.

#### Higher Ranks
Most arrows can be crafted at higher ranks, boosting their potency.  When crafting an arrow at a higher rank, the recipe for that rank replaces base recipe entirely.

The recipes for the different ranks are listed in an abbreviated format.

\columnbreak

### Arrow Descriptions
The whetstones are presented here in alphabetical order.

#### Arrow of Horrid Wilting
*Legend*
___
- **Recipe:**  7,500gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 Epic Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 2 Very Rare Ingredients with Shadow or Water Energy
___

This magical arrow drains the moisture of all creatures within range of a targeted area. When firing it, you may choose to target an unoccupied space.

After hitting a creature or reaching its target area, the arrow draws the moisture from all creatures within 30ft. of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. Constructs and undead aren’t affected, and plants and water elementals make this saving throw with disadvantage. A creature takes 6d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Nonmagical plants in the area that aren’t creatures, such as trees and shrubs, wither and die instantly.

**At Higher Levels:**
|    Level   | Proficiency|  Recipe |  Damage  | Save DC |
|:---------:|:----------:|:-----------------:| :----------------:|:-----------:| 
|   8th       | Legend     | 7,500gp: <br> 1 Epc Prmry, <br> 2 VRr Shdw, Wtr|   6d8   |  18 |
|   9th       | Legend     | 12,000gp: <br> 1 Epc Prmry, <br> 3 VRr Shdw, Wtr|   7d8 | 19 |

#### Acidic Arrow
*Apprentice*
___
- **Recipe:**  180gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 Uncommon Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 1 Common Ingredient with Fiendish, Primeval, or Water Energy
___

This magical arrow explodes with a spray of acid upon reaching its target

After hitting a creature with an attack using the enhanced arrow, the target is sprayed with acid, causing it to take an additional 2d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the target is splashed with acid for half as much of the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.  Hit or miss, the arrow is destroyed.

At higher ranks, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 per rank.

**At Higher Levels:**
|    Level   | Proficiency|  Recipe |  Damage <br> Increase  | 
|:---------:|:----------:|:-----------------:| :----------------:|

___

This magical arrow drains the life from its victim.

After hitting a creature with an attack using the enhanced arrow, if the target is not a construct or undead, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a non magical plant that isn’t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies.

#### Chaos Arrow
*Apprentice*
___
- **Recipe:**  90gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 Common Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 2 Mundane Ingredient with Chaotic Energy
___

This arrow is infused with elemental chaos.

After striking a target with the magic arrow, the target takes 2d8 + 1d6 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

| d8 |  Damage Type  | 
|:--:|:-------------:|
| 1  |      Acid     |
| 2  |      Cold     | 
| 3  |      Fire     |
| 4  |      Force    |
| 5  |      Lightning|
| 6  |      Poison   |
| 7  |      Psychic  |
| 8  |      Thunder  |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 30 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again. A creature can be targeted only once by each use of this effect. 

At higher levels, the magic arrow deals an additional 1d6 damage of type rolled per additional level.
