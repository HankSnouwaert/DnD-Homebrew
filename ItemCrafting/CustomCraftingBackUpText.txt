# Magic Item Crafting

An elven smith looks proudly over the newly completed sword as it lays amongst the remains of the various ingredients used forge it to her own custom design.  She raises out her hand and it flies into her grip, electricity dancing along its edge.

A bloodied, but determined dwarf, carefully skins a section of undamaged hide from a defeated dragon. The battle nearly cost him everything, but the enchanted scales will bring him a fortune. 

A human wizard searches through the musty tomes of a long forgotten library until he finds it at last.  The designs for the fabled Robe of the Archmagi.

The Magic Item Crafting System allows players to create magic items from the Dungeon Master Guide as well as their own custom creations using magical ingredients that are found through adventuring.  These ingredients serve as an alternate form of treasure DMs can provide to their players.  Player characters with the appropriate tools proficiencies can craft items from the ingredients they find, or they can find NPCs with the skills needed to craft the items they desire. Players with no intention of crafting can simply sell the ingredients they find.
## Using The Crafting System

The Magic Item Crafting System is broken up into three main parts.  Parts 1 & 2 can be implemented independently of the other parts of this document, but Part 3 assumes Parts 1 & 2 are both being used.

<b>Part 1</b> covers the ways in which you can add magical ingredients as a form of treasure into your games.  These are similar to gems and art objects from the DMG, and can be used to create more flavorful and engaging treasure as players harvest and discover strange magical materials.

<b>Part 2</b> is specific to DMs and includes revised Magic Item Tables as well as new magic items suitable for low level characters.  These alternative Magic Item Tables sort magic items based on their perceived in game value rather the rarity listed in the DMG.  This creates a more consistent power scale in terms of the magic items players will receive as they level up.

<b>Part 3</b> includes rules that allow players to convert harvested ingredients into magic items of their own design.  This is followed by a section listing all the available magic effects that can be incorporated into an item.

# Chapter 1: Magic Ingredients
Throughout their adventures, players acquire vast amounts of wealth.  Aside from magical items, this generally takes the form of gold and a handful of gems and random art objects.  This section details how players can acquire more unique wealth in the form of Magic Ingredients.  

Magic Ingredients are items and materials players can find during their adventures that have a gp value they can be sold for, similar to the gems and art objects in the DMG, but also have properties that potentially make them useful for crafting.  Magic Ingredients can come in many forms, from enchanted roses and hydra blood, to dragon hide and fiendish scrap metal.

Despite the fact that they are innately magical in nature, Magic Ingredients generally have little to no use in their current state and are mostly useful for the gold they can fetch on the open market, or their use in crafting more functional magic items.

## Ingredient Properties
Whatever form they take, there are three general properties that determine a Magic Ingredient's value and utility: Rarity, Material, and Energy.

### Rarity
Rarity determines the gp value of the Ingredient.  Rarer Ingredients are generally found in more dangerous settings and are worth more gp.  

##### Ingredient Rarity Values
| Ingredient Rarity |  Value (gp)    | 
|:-----------------:|:-------------:|
|  {Rarity 1}       |      5        |
|  {Rarity 2}       |      10       | 
|  {Rarity 3}       |      50       |
|  {Rarity 4}       |      100      |
|  {Rarity 5}       |      500      |
|  {Rarity 6}       |      1,000    |
|  {Rarity 7}       |      5,000    |
|  {Rarity 8}       |      10,000   |
|  {Rarity 9}       |      50,000   |

### Material
Material describes what sort of physical substance makes up the majority of the Ingredient, such a metal, bone, or wood.  The material helps determines who is likely to carry them and what sorts of creatures they can be harvested from.  

The material is also important for determining what sorts of items the Ingredient can be use to craft and what types of tool proficiencies are need to know how to work with the Ingredient. For example, a magic sword will generally require metal to craft, and proficiency with Smith's Tools will be needed to know how to work the metal into the sword.

#### Bone
Bone Ingredients include shells, coral, and carapaces from the creatures with exoskeletons. It can most often be found through harvesting slain creatures.  In this document Woodcarver's Tools have been renamed Carver's Tools as those tools can also be used to carve bone into various types of items.

#### Cloth
Cloth Ingredients include any materials that can be used as a fabric, which includes animal products such as silks and furs.  The animal products can be harvest from the associated creatures, otherwise cloth is generally found in the possession of creatures that have use for it.  Cloth is primarily useful to Weavers.

#### Essence
Essence Ingredients include ethereal substances, and it is often left behind by supernatural beings that are expelled from the material plane, especially incorporeal creatures. Due to its magical and incorporeal nature, it must be harvested in vials for later use.  Though there isn't any type of craftsman that specifically needs Essence for their crafting, their formless nature means that they can be incorporated into nearly any type of craftable item.

#### Flesh
Flesh includes any form of meat or organs and is typically harvest from slain creatures.  Flesh can be used as an aid when crafting certain types of items, but is primarily useful for crafting consumable items and as such is sought after by those with Alchemist's Tools and Cook's Tools. Flesh generally needs to be preserved for long term storage to prevent rotting.

#### Fluid
Fluid can include any form of liquid Ingredient from enchanted water to magical blood, and can be used as an aid in crafting many types of items.  Harvesting and storing it usually requires access to a vial or some other container that can hold liquid. 

#### Gem
Gems are often kept by creatures that understand their inherent value, and can be found in many treasure stashes.  They can be incorporated into most types of items and are primary type of Ingredient needed by Jewelers.

\pagebreakNum

#### Hide
Hides can be made into many types of wearable equipment and can be harvested from most types of beasts, dragons, and monstrosities.  It can also be found in the form a wearable goods found on many types of humanoids. Hides are the primary type of Ingredient used by Leatherworkers.

#### Metal
Metals are most often found in the form of weapons and gear.  While this equipment may be usable in its current state, it generally won't have any magical functionality as is.  Crafters can break down this equipment to utilize it in the creation of magic items, and metals such as these serve as the primary material needed by Smiths.

#### Parchment
Parchment includes other flexible materials uses for writing and drawing such as canvas and paper.  Parchment rarely appears in the wild and is more often found in the possession of intelligent creatures and scattered through locations such as temples and libraries. Parchment is the primary material needed by Calligraphers, Cartographers, and Painters.

#### Plant
Plants include most forms of fungus and vegetation other than carvable wood. Other than being harvested off of plant creatures, plants are usually found through foraging.  Plants have limited usage in the creation of weapons and gear, but are useful crafting consumable items.  As such they are useful for Alchemists, Chefs, and Herbalists. 

#### Stone
Stone includes any non-metal and non-gemstone minerals.  It can be harvested from stone based constructs and elementals and found in mountainous or subterranean environments.  Stone can be used as a component in many types of items, especially those created by  carvers.  Glassblowers can also turn stone into glass, making it the primary material needed for their crafting.

#### Wood
Wood includes all carvable, plant based material.  It can be harvest through foraging in wooded environments and found in the form of weapons and equipment.  While this equipment may be usable in its current state, it generally won't have any magical functionality as is.  Crafters can break down this equipment to utilize it in the creation of magic items, and wood such as this serves as the primary material needed by Carvers.

### Energy
All Magic Ingredients have some sort of magical property which is referred to as that Ingredient's Energy.  There are different types of Energies which correspond to the different supernatural forces present in the world.  Ingredients found in close proximity to those forces are more likely to have its associated Energy.  For example, Ingredients found near a crossing to the Feywild are more likely to have Fey Energy.  

The Energy of an Ingredient dictates what sorts of magical effects it can add to the item it is being crafted into.  Different types of Energies allow access to different types of magical item effects. 

#### Fire
Fire Energy stems primarily from the Elemental Plane of Fire.  Ingredients with Fire Energy are most often found in locations bordering that plane, or any other that has abundant sources of flame, such as the Nine Hells. 

It can also be found in areas of intense heat such as near volcanos or in desserts. Ingredients carried by creatures that wield magical flames also tend to have Fire Energy.

\pagebreakNum 

## Gathering Ingredients
Outside of the treasure hoards uncovered throughout their adventures, the most common ways players will acquire Magic Ingredients will be by harvesting them from slain creatures, foraging for them in the wilderness, and finding them through the investigation.

After overcoming dangerous enemies or other encounters, players will usually have the chance to collect some amount of wealth afterwards in the form of money or valuable Ingredients. Ingredients can be gained by either harvesting them from slain creatures, foraging for them in the surrounding area, or using investigation to discover the Ingredients hidden nearby or on the bodies of defeated foes.

For more information on how these Ingredients should be made available to players, see <b>Part 2</b>.

### Harvesting
Slain creatures often provide an opportunity for players to harvest their remains for valuable Ingredients.  The type of creature that has been slain dictates what types of Ingredients can be harvested from it and what skills will be needed to do the harvesting. The following list provides guidelines for what types of skills will normally be required to harvest Ingredients from different types of creatures, though the DM may make different rulings.
___
- **Beast:** Survival, Nature
- **Celestial:** Survival, Religion
- **Construct:** Arcana
- **Dragon:** Survival, Nature 
- **Elemental:** Nature, Arcana
- **Fey:** Nature, Survival
- **Fiend:** Survival, Religion
- **Giant:** Survival, Medicine
- **Humanoid:** Survival, Medicine
- **Ooze:** Nature, Arcana
- **Plant** Nature, Survival
- **Undead (Corporeal):** Same as Equivalent Living Creature
- **Undead (Incorporeal):** Arcana, Religion
___

The character making the harvesting check does not need proficiency in the required skill and may receive help from another character to gain advantage on the check.  If all characters involved in the harvesting both have proficiency with the required skill, they may choose what type of material they harvest, assuming it is a material they can harvest from the creature using the chosen skill.  Characters have no control over the type of energy the harvested Ingredient has.

If a character has proficiency with tools capable of crafting items, those tools may be used to harvest Ingredients of that tool's **Primary Material Type**.  For example, Smith's tools can be used to harvest metal Ingredients.  See **Part 3** for more information on the **Primary Material Type** for each tool.

For more information on the types of Ingredients that can be harvested and setting the harvesting DCs, see **Part 3**.

\columnbreak

### Foraging and Investigation
Sometimes Ingredients are found in the surrounding environment rather than harvested from slain foes.  When facing encounters with creatures that can't be harvested or encounters that don't involve an creatures at all, Ingredients will often be found by foraging or investigating the adventure locale.  In these cases, the players have no control over the types of Ingredients that are collected, even if they have proficiency in the skills being used.

##### Foraging
During wilderness based adventures where the environment itself is the challenge the players must overcome, the DM may call for Wisdom (Survival) checks to find Ingredients in the environment.

##### Investigating
Humanoid creatures generally can't be harvested for Ingredients, but they often keep valuable items hidden on their person or in their territory.  In these cases, the DM may call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find hidden Ingredients rather than harvesting them.

## Buying Ingredients

Players may attempt to shop for and purchase Ingredients in between their adventures.  Due to their exotic nature and rarity, Ingredients are usually not readily available in the open market, and players will have to spend time and gold to make contacts and find Ingredients available for purchase.  

**Resources.** The cost and difficulty of finding Ingredients depends on the rarity of the Ingredients the player wishes to purchase. There are four tiers of rarity at which the player can shop, detailed below. Shopping for Ingredients requires one work week, and an amount of gp dependent on the Expense Cost for the tier of rarity the player has chosen. The player may spend more time and money to increase the odds of finding the desired Ingredient. At the DM's discretion, shopping may take less time or some areas may not have access to higher tiers of Ingredients.

**Resolution.** The character seeking Ingredients for purchase makes a Charisma (Persuasion) check to determine the quantity and quality of the Ingredients found.  The character may add a +1 to the roll for every additional week spent searching for Ingredients and an additional +1 for every additional expenditure of gp equal to the Expense Cost.  The total of these bonuses may not exceed +10.  

When shopping for an Ingredient, the character determines a type of Ingredient being searched for, either by specifying a desired Material (such as Metal), or a specific Energy (such as Fire).  The non specified attribute is determined at random by the DM. In the character's search, other random Ingredients will usually turn up for purchase as shown in the Shopping Tables below.  The properties of these Ingredients are determined randomly by the DM.  All Ingredients found can be purchased by the character at their gp value. See **Ingredient Rarity Values** (pg.2) for the gp values of different Ingredient rarities.

The player may specify both the Material and the Energy of the desired Ingredient when shopping (such as Fire Metal).  However, doing so causes the Charisma (Persuasion) check to be made with disadvantage.  Conversely, the character may choose not to specify any attribute of the desired Ingredient, and make the check with advantage.

### Random Property Tables
The DM may use these tables to determine the random attributes of Ingredients found while shopping.  These tables assume all Material and Energy types are equally likely to be found.  Depending on the area where the characters are shopping, the DM may modify these tables to favor some properties or exclude others.  Players should be made aware if some types of Ingredients are unavailable before they begin shopping.

## Breaking Down Items

Players can break down magic items they have no use for and salvage them for Ingredients.  Doing so requires proficiency with the tools that would be used to craft the item being broken down and an amount of time dependent on the complexity and rarity of the item.  

The Rarity of the salvaged Ingredients is dependent on the power of the item's magic effects.  

The Material of the salvaged Ingredients is dependent on the materials the item is made of.  If the item is made of multiple materials, the player can generally chose the type material that is salvaged.  Though, if the player is harvesting multiple Ingredients, the GM may limit the amounts of some types of material that are salvaged.

The Energy of the salvaged Ingredients is dependent on the Energy types associated with the item's effects.  For example, an item with an effect associated with Air or Fey Energy can be salvaged for an Ingredient with one of those Energy types.

If the effect can have multiple Energy types associated with it, the DM can determine which of these Energy types the salvaged Ingredient has randomly, or choose the Energy type that best matches the item.

A permanent item with multiple effects can be broken down into one Ingredient per effect, and consumable items can be broken down into a single Ingredient as shown in the table below.

##### Rarity of Salvaged Ingredients
| Item Effect Level  | Permanent Item             | Consumable Item    | 
|:-------------:|:--------------------------:| :-----------------:|
| Apprentice    |  Uncommon <br> Ingredient  |      Mundane <br> Ingredient       | 
| Journeyman    |  Rare <br> Ingredient      |     Common <br> Ingredient        |  
| Expert        |  Very Rare <br> Ingredient |     Uncommon <br> Ingredient      |  
| Master        |  Epic <br> Ingredient      |     Rare <br> Ingredient         |    
| Legend        |  Legendary <br> Ingredient |     Very Rare <br> Ingredient     | 

The amount of time it takes to break down an item is dependent on the the amount of effects the item has, and the level of those effect.  The table below lists the Base Crafting Time for breaking down an item based on the effects it has.  The rules for the amount of time it takes to break down an item are the same as they are for crafting an item.  See **Crafting Time** on page 10 for more details.

##### Base Time to Break Down Magic Items

| Effect Level  | Permanent Item Effect      | Consumable Item    | 
|:-------------:|:--------------------------:| :-----------------:|
| Apprentice    |      10 hrs                |     2 hrs          | 
| Journeyman    |      15 hrs                |     3 hrs          |  
| Expert        |      20 hrs                |     4 hrs          |  
| Master        |      25 hrs                |     5 hrs          |

# Chapter 2: Magic Item Tables 

This section contains the information needed for GMs to run sessions with magic Ingredients as an alternative form of loot.  It contains alternative versions of the treasure tables and magic item tables found in the DMG that account for magic ingredients as treasure.


## Treasure Hoards
The following treasure hoard tables are alternatives to those found in the DMG and replace gems and art objects with magic ingredients.  These tables only list the rarity and quantity of ingredients found.  The material and energy properties can be determined randomly or you can pick out properties that suit the location where they are found.

## Individual Treasure Tables

The following treasure tables can be used as alternatives to the individual treasure tables found in the DMG.  These tables can be used to provide magic ingredients as treasure rather than gold.  If these ingredients are being harvested or found using Investigation or Survival, the tables can also be used to set the DCs for these checks and determine how many ingredients are found based on how well the player did on the check.  

These tables only inform you how many ingredients should be harvested and at what rarity.  The material and energy properties are dependent on nature of the encounter.  

### Harvesting: Challenge 0-4 
|Harvesting DC| Ingredients Harvested|
|:-----------:|:--------------------:|
|     10      |     Poor x1          |
|     20      |     Poor x2          |

### Harvesting: Challenge 5-10

|     15      |     Common  x1       |
|     20      |     Common  x2       |

## Encounter Ingredient Tables

The Individual Harvesting tables describe the quantity and quality of the ingredients found by players for encounters of a given challenge, but they don't determine the material or energy type.  These are dependent on the specifics of the encounter.  

When planning an encounter that will yield ingredients as a form of treasure, you can create Ingredient Tables that will dictate the types of ingredients that encounter can yield.  

As an example, lets assume we're planning an encounter with a Giant Crocodile from the Monster Manual.

##### Step 1: Determine Harvesting Method

If the encounter involves creatures that can be slain and harvested for ingredients, determine what types of skills are needed to harvest the creature.  The section on Harvesting in **Part 1** goes provides guidelines as to what skills are generally used for different creature types.  

If the players are not likely to be slaying any harvestable creatures, consider placing the ingredients in the immediate environment.  If they have been hidden, an Intelligence (Investigation) check may be needed to find them.  If they are located in the wilderness, a Wisdom (Survival) check may be used instead.  

The section on Gathering Ingredients in **Part 1** gives more details on how ingredients can be gathered.

For the Giant Crocodile example, we can assume an Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival) check can be used when harvesting the materials from the crocodile.

##### Step 2: Determine Rarity

Rarity is dependent on the challenge rating of the encounter.  Simply match the challenge rating to the appropriate Harvesting table from the Individual Treasure Tables to determine the possible rarities for the ingredients.

A Giant Crocodile has a CR 5, so the Challenge 5-10 table would be used.  This means the players could either harvest ingredients with a rarity of Mundane or Common.

##### Step 3: Determine Material Types

Determine what types of materials the players are likely to harvest or find for the given encounter.  The materials found should be intuitive for the players, so it is recommended you pick 1 to 4 materials that make sense for the given encounter.

When harvesting a beast, like the Giant Crocodile, Bone, Flesh, Fluid, and Hide usually make the most sense.  

##### Material Types
|  Material     | 
|:-------------:| 
| {Material 1}  | 
| {Material 2}  |  
| {Material 3}  | 
| {Material 4}  |    
| {Material 5}  | 
| {Material 6}  |  
| {Material 7}  |   
| {Material 8}  |  
| {Material 9}  |  
| {Material 10} |  
| {Material 11} |  
| {Material 12} |  

\pagebreakNum

Once you've picked your materials, create a table with them so can pick one at random if needed.

|d4 | Material |
|:-:|:--------:|
| 1 |   Bone   |
| 2 |   Hide   |
| 3 |   Flesh  |
| 4 |   Fluid  |

##### Step 4: Determine Energy Types

The energy type of an ingredient represents its metaphysical properties, and can sometimes be harder to intuit.  **Part 1** contains descriptions of the 12 energy types used in this document and what sorts of creatures and environments they are each associated with.  

It most cases it is best to pick 1 or 2 energy types for a given encounter.  If the encounter isn't very supernatural in nature, it makes more sense for the ingredients found to not have an energy type and be Neutral.  Creatures and environments that are more otherworldly in nature will be more likely to yield ingredients with a matching energy type.

##### Energy Types
|  Energy     | 
|:-------------:| 
| {Energy 1}  | 
| {Energy 2}  |  
| {Energy 3}  | 
| {Energy 4}  |    
| {Energy 5}  | 
| {Energy 6}  |  
| {Energy 7}  |   
| {Energy 8}  |  
| {Energy 9}  |  
| {Energy 10} |  
| {Energy 11} |  
| {Energy 12} |  

For the Giant Crocodile example, because the creature is an oversized beast, the Primeval energy is appropriate.  It is also a partially aquatic creature, so the Water energy can be used as well.  Because it is not necessarily supernatural in origin, we'll set the odds so that half the time, the harvested ingredient is neutral.

##### Energy Types 
|d4 | Energy |
|:-:|:--------:|
| 1-2 | Neutral  |
| 3 | Primeval |
| 4 |  Water   |

These energy types are by no means set in stone. Customizing the ingredients being found to the circumstances of the encounter can help reinforce a theme for an entire adventure.  For example, if the adventurers were exploring a land cursed by necromancers, you could have all the creatures in there yield ingredients with the Shadow property to show how the corruption has seeped into the wildlife.

##### Example Ingredient Tables: <br> Giant Crocodile (CR 5)

**Harvesting Skills:** Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival)

|Harvesting DC | Ingredients Harvested|
|:-----------:|:--------------------:|
|     10      |     Mundane x1       |
|     13      |     Mundane x2       |
|     15      |     Common  x1       |
|     20      |     Common  x2       |
|     25      |     Common  x3       |

|d4 | Material |
|:-:|:--------:|
| 1 |   Bone   |
| 2 |   Hide   |
| 3 |   Flesh  |
| 4 |   Fluid  |

|d4 | Energy |
|:-:|:--------:|
| 1-2 | Neutral  |
| 3 | Primeval |
| 4 |  Water   |

## Describing Ingredients

In order to sell ingredients or use them for crafting, all the players need to know about them are their rarity, material, and energy property, if any.  However, the players will often feel more immersed when there is more to the ingredients they find than simple mechanical descriptions.  Telling players they harvested "Common Primeval Hide" can suffice, but describing it as "Primordial Crocodile Scales" will make it come alive and feel like a real item they collected.  This is especially important if the ingredient is a special, stand-alone item like a quest reward or something harvested from a major foe.

While using your imagination to come up with inspiring narrative descriptions for major items can be a fun creative exercise, trying to do this for every item harvested or discovered throughout an adventure can be daunting.  If players are repeatedly harvesting multiple ingredients after every encounter, it will can be simpler to describe them solely based on their rarity, material, and energy.  

If the players harvest several bones from a group of slain giant crocodiles, you can simply refer to them all as common bones.  If one of the players decides he's keen on collecting a crocodile jaw, he can specify that that is specifically what he's harvesting, and add that level of detail to his ingredient.

\pagebreakNum

Alternatively, if you know you will be using the same or similar enemies throughout an adventure, you can customize their loot tables to reflect a greater level of detail, as shown in the example below.

##### Example Ingredient Tables: <br> Giant Crocodile (CR 5)

**Harvesting Skills:** Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Survival)

|Harvesting DC | Ingredients Harvested|
|:-----------:|:--------------------:|
|     10      |     Mundane x1       |
|     13      |     Mundane x2       |
|     15      |     Common  x1       |
|     20      |     Common  x2       |
|     25      |     Common  x3       |

|d4 | Material |   Mundane Ingredient   | Common Ingredient  |  
|:-:|:--------:|:----------------------:|:-------------------:|
| 1 |   Bone   | Giant Crocodile Teeth  |  Giant Crocodile Bone |
| 2 |   Hide   | Giant Crocodile Hide   |  Giant Crocodile Scales|
| 3 |   Flesh  | Giant Crocodile Meat   |  Giant Crocodile Heart |
| 4 |   Fluid  | Giant Crocodile Blood  |  Giant Crocodile Tears |

|d4 | Energy   | Description Modifier 
|:-:|:--------:|:-----:|
| 1-2 | Neutral | None |
| 3 | Primeval | Primal | 
| 4 |  Water   | Drenched | 

The **Description Modifier** represents an adjective you can add to the ingredient's name based on what energy type it is.  For example, common primeval flesh, could be described as a Primal Giant Crocodile Heart. 

This loot table isn't meant to be followed religiously, but to serve as an example of how you can add more character to the loot players harvest, while still keeping the naming conventions consistent enough to avoid confusion.  If you or the players suddenly decide the crocodile's liver should be harvested, you can always deviate from what's listed here.

## Magic Item Tables

The following magic item tables are alternatives to those found in the DMG.  These tables are organized according to the approximate gp value of the items.  While the magic items in the DMG have rarities that can be used to determine an approximate gp value, these values often conflict with the items actual power and utility.  

These tables dispense with most of the assumptions about the rarity of items according to the DMG and reorganize them based on a reassessment of their actual power level.  

These tables list the gold value of each item along with how many "magic effects" it can be assumed the item has. Knowing how many magic effects an item has is important if players wish to use custom crafting to add additional effects to the item.  An item that already has three or more effects on it cannot have any more added through custom crafting, and the more effects the item possess, the greater the cost of adding additional effects.

# Chapter 3: Custom Crafting

Players can use magic ingredients they find throughout their adventures to create their own magic items with custom effects of their choosing. Crafting such an item requires proficiency with the appropriate artisan's tool, with different tools being used to craft different kinds of items. 

This section describes the process for crafting a custom item, defines the different types of items, and lists the different types of magical effects players can incorporate into their items.  For details on Ingredients and how they can be harvested, see <b> Part 1 </b>. 

### Tool Proficiencies

The tools capable of crafting the types of magical items listed in this document are: Cobbler’s Tools, Glassblower's Tools, Jeweler’s Tools, Leatherworker’s Tools, Smith's Tools, Weaver’s Tools, and Woodcarver’s Tools.  Throughout the rest of this document, Woodcarver’s Tools will be referred to as Carver’s Tools, as these tools can also be used to craft items made from bone and stone.  

As a character’s Prof. Bonus increases, their proficiency with their tools also increases, thus giving them access to more powerful magic effects that can be crafted into their items.  For the purposes of tool use and crafting, these proficiency levels are referred to as Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, Master, and Legend.  All magic item effects have a Proficiency Level at which they become available.  If a character has expertise in a tool, their Proficiency Level with that tool is twice their Prof. Bonus.

##### Proficiency Levels
| Proficiency Level |  Prof. Bonus  | Level Range| Labor Cost <br> (gp per hr.)
|:-----------------:|:-------------:| :---------:| :-----------------:|
|  {Prof Level 1}   |      +2       |     1-4    |  4 |
|  {Prof Level 2}   |      +3       |     5-8    |  12 |
|  {Prof Level 3}   |      +4       |     9-12   |  28 |
|  {Prof Level 4}   |      +5       |    13-16   |  60 |
|  {Prof Level 5}   |      +6       |    17-20   |  120 |

### Crafting a Custom Magic Item
When crafting a custom magic item, the player can add up to three unique magic effects. Each magic effect has a Recipe that dictates the gp worth of Crafting Supplies that must be used in the item's creation along with what types of magic Ingredients must be amongst those supplies.  The specific descriptions and Recipes for these different effects can be found later in this section.

#### Crafting Supplies
Crafting Supplies refer to anything with a gp value that contributes towards the magic item's creation.  Every magic effect has a Supply Cost, representing the gp value worth of Crafting Supplies that must be included in the item's creation to add the effect.  

Crafting Supplies can include any magic Ingredients that are usable by the artisan's tools being used to create the item. They can also include more abstract tools and reagents that can be purchased from vendors in larger towns and cities. Crafting Supplies bought this way are not considered to be magical Ingredients, and the DM may rule that a particular settlement does not have the means to provide such magical Crafting Supplies to players.  

Additionally, if the item being crafted is a magic weapon, shield, or suit of armor, the non-magical equivalent item, or enough supplies to create it, must be provided.  This is in addition to the Supply Costs dictated by the recipes.

All Crafting Supplies used in an item's creation are consumed once the item is completed.

#### Ingredients
Ingredients are magical materials that players find and harvest during their adventures.  Though they can come in many forms, for the purposes of crafting, the three descriptors that matter are: 

* <b>Rarity:</b> Determines the value in terms of gp
* <b>Material:</b> Determines how it can be used by different tools
* <b>Energy:</b> Different item effects require specific energies

No more than 10 Ingredients can be used at a time when crafting an item. For more information on these properties and harvesting Ingredients in general, see <b> Part 1 </b>.

#### Adding Multiple Effects
If multiple magical effects are being added to an item, all the recipes for each magic effect must be met.  

Additionally, if two effects are being built into an item, the total Supply Cost increases by one half.  For example, if an item is being crafted with two effects totaling to a Supply Cost of 1000gp, the final Supply Cost would be 1500gp.  

If three effects are being built into the item, the total Supply Cost is doubled.  For example, if an item is being created with three effect totaling to a Supply Cost of 2000gp, the final Supply Cost would be 4000gp.

This represents the increased complexity in trying to combine multiple magical effects into a single item.

#### Crafting Time
The time it takes to craft any item is dependent of the skill of the crafters.  The Base Crafting Time is a baseline for how many working hours it will take to craft an item, and is shown in the <b>Crafting Time</b> table on the next page.  However, the actual crafting time is dependent on the Proficiency Level of the crafter.  For each hour spent working on the item, subtract a number of hours equal to the crafter’s Prof. Bonus from the Base Crafting Time. Subtract twice their Prof. Bonus if they have expertise in the tool.  When the Base Crafting Time reaches zero, the item is complete.

A character may spend up to 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week working on an item.  Two characters with the relevant tool proficiencies can work on together on an item to add their Prof. Bonuses and speed up crafting. 

\pagebreak

The crafting can also be started before you have all your Crafting Supplies.  You can complete a percentage of your crafting equal to the percentage of the Crafting Supplies you have provided.  For example, if your item requires 3000gp worth of Crafting Supplies, and you have 2000gp worth of Crafting Supplies, you can complete up to two thirds of the crafting.  

##### Crafting Time
| Effect Level | Base Crafting Time  (Hrs. Per Effect)  | 
|:-----------------:|:-------------:| 
|  {Prof Level 1}   |      50       | 
|  {Prof Level 2}   |      75       |  
|  {Prof Level 3}   |      100      | 
|  {Prof Level 4}   |      125      | 
|  {Prof Level 5}   |      150      | 

#### Labor Cost
If none of the player characters in your party have proficiency with the tools needed to craft an item, they may be able to find an NPC with the necessary skills.  NPCs with higher Proficiency Levels will generally be harder to find, and at the DM's discretion, the players may have to travel to large cities or remote locations to find especially skilled artisans.

The payment required for this crafting service is dependent on the skill level of the crafter and how many hours are being worked.  See the <b> Proficiency Levels </b> table on the previous page to see hourly cost of crafters based on their proficiency. 

### Upgrading a Magic Item
Some magic items can be modified and upgraded. This can involve empowering existing effects or adding new ones entirely. As part of upgrading an item, the crafter may also remove any existing effects.

#### Upgrading Effects to Higher Ranks
If an existing effect is being upgraded, the crafter must meet the proficiency requirements for the rank it is being upgraded to.  Each rank has its own recipe, and the crafter can upgrade an effect through multiple ranks at once as long as the cumulative requirements of all those recipes are met.  

If the item has two effects, then the Supply Cost for upgrading one of those effects to a higher rank is increased by one half.  If the item has three effects, the Supply Cost is doubled instead.

If the item is being upgraded through multiple ranks at once, treat the crafting time as though you are applying one effect with the proficiency level of the highest rank being added.

#### Adding New Effects
If a new effect is being added to the item, Crafting Supplies worth half the cost of the item must be provided in order to make it ready for the infusion of a new effect.  This must be done for each new effect being added. 

If the new effect being added would be the item's second effect, the effect's Supply Cost is increased by one half.  If the new effect would be the item's third effect, the Supply Cost is doubled.

The normal rules for determining crafting time and labor costs apply to upgraded and added effects.

### Substituting Ingredients 
Magic effect recipes specify requirements for specific types of Ingredients at specific rarities.  When crafting, you may substitute a required Ingredient with a number of lesser Ingredients that have the same required properties and at least the same combined value in gp.
* For example, a requirement for an {Rarity 4} {Material 5} could be met with two {Rarity 3} {Material 5}s

* A requirement for an {Rarity 4} Ingredient with {Energy 1} Energy could be met with two {Rarity 3} Ingredients that both have {Energy 1} Energy

Additionally, an Ingredient of greater value can replace a number of Ingredients with the same properties as it that are equal to or less than its gp value.
* For example, one {Rarity 5} {Energy 1} {Material 5} used in a recipe would be equivalent to using five {Rarity 4} {Energy 1} {Material 5}s

## Magic Item Effects
This section provides descriptions of the different item effects available to players through custom crafting. Each item effect contains some or all of the following descriptors. 

#### Item Type
This is the type of item the magic effect can be applied to.
#### Tools
This lists the types of tools that can be used to craft an item with this property.
#### Attunement 
This indicates whether or not applying this effect to an item will cause it to require attunement
#### Recipe
The recipe lists the required gp value of Crafting Supplies and what types of Ingredients are needed to craft the magic effect.  Most recipes include requirements for: 
* Crafting Supplies equal to a certain amount of gp
* Ingredients of the Primary Material
* Ingredients with a specific Magic Energy.  

These requirements are independent of each other and can be met separately with the same Ingredients.

##### Recipe Example
Assume a smith is making a weapon with the <i> Concussive </i> property, which has the following recipe
___
- **Recipe:** 1,500gp worth of Crafting Supplies, including:
- * &nbsp; 1 {Rarity 6} Ingredient of the Primary Material
- * &nbsp; 1 {Rarity 5} Ingredient with {Energy 3} or {Energy 12} Energy

Since this is being made with smith's tools, the Primary Material is Metal.  If the smith used a Very Rare Metal with the Fire property (worth 1,000gp), this would meet the Primary Material requirement and pay for 1,000gp of the 1,500gp Crafting Supply requirement.  If the smith then provided a Rare Gem with the Earth property (worth 500gp), this would satisfy Energy requirement and pay for the remaining 500gp worth of Crafting Supplies.

Alternatively, if the smith has a Very Rare Metal with the Earth property, that could be used to simultaneously meet the requirement for the Primary Material and the needed Energy.  The remaining 500gp worth of needed Crafting Supplies could then be met using gold to purchase supplies.

#### Higher Ranks
Some effects have higher level ranks that boost their potency.  When adding an effect with multiple ranks, you may choose to upgrade the effect to a higher rank if you meet that rank’s proficiency requirement and you meet the requirements of that rank’s recipe.  You may upgrade through multiple ranks at once as long as the recipes of all the ranks are satisfied. 
When upgrading an item, you may boost an existing effect to higher ranks.  See <b> Upgrading Effects to Higher Ranks </b> (pg.5) for more details.  

The recipes for the different ranks are listed in an abbreviated format.

___
The weapon has the ability to slow creatures it strikes.  This may be result of a chilling effect, binding earth magic, or warping the very nature of time around the creature.  
If you hit a target with an attack, it must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature's speed is halved, it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it can't use reactions for 1 minute. Moreover, on each of its turns, it can take either an action or a bonus action, but not both. At the end of each of its turns, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. The weapon can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

#### Spell Infused
*{Prof Level 1}*
___
- **Item Type:** Based on Spell
- **Tools:** Based on Item Type
- **Attunement:** No
- **Recipe:** Based on Spell
___

The item is infused with a specific spell determined at the time of its crafting.  While in possession of the item, you may use it to cast the spell.  If the spell requires a saving throw or attack roll, it is determined by its level, shown in the **Recipes per Spell Level** table. If the spell requires concentration, the one who uses the item to cast the spell must maintain concentration on it.  Once the spell has been cast, it can't be cast again in this way until the next dawn.

If the spell can target you and does not require an attack roll or saving throw, and the spell is infused into a wearable item, you may only target yourself with the spell.  For example, if you infuse *Fly* into boots, you can only target yourself with the spell while wearing the boots.  However, spells cast this way do not require concentration.

The chosen spell determines what type of item it can be crafted into and what the Required Energy is.  Any tool capable of crafting the item type can be used to craft this item.  The <b> Spells for Custom Items </b> section details all the spells that can be crafted into different types of items, along with the Required Energy types for each spell.

#### Spell Staff
*{Prof Level 4}*
___
- **Item Type:** Staff
- **Tools:** Carver, Smith
- **Attunement:** Yes (By a Spellcaster)
- **Recipe:** Varies

The staff has 10 charges.  While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of its spells.  Each spell cast expends a number of charges equal to its spell level.  You may cast spells at a higher level by expending more charges this way.  The spells use your spell save DC and spell attack bonus.  

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.  If you expend the last charge, roll a d20.  On a 1, the staff is destroyed.

When creating the staff, choose a Required Energy type.  This will determine what types of spells can be built into the staff.  The <b> Base Spell Staff Recipe </b> depends on the highest level spell built into the staff. This highest level spell is automatically added to the staff as part of its creation.  

Up to two additional spells may be added to the staff as long as they have the same Required Energy type and they have a lower spell level than the first spell added.  Every spell added to the staff carries an extra cost shown in the <b> Recipe Cost Per Spell </b> table. 

See the <b> Spells for Custom Items </b> section for information on what energy types correspond to what spells and what spells can be added to a staff.

This item effect can be added multiple times so long as no spells of a higher level are added and the Required Energy type remains the same.  When it is added additional times, it does not add any extra charges and the base recipe cost does not need to be met.  However, the recipe costs for any new spells added must still be met.
