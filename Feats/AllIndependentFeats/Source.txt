# Spellcasting Feats
The feats are presented here in alphabetical order.  They are designed to help players emulate how mages from the different schools in the *Strixhaven* setting cast their spells.  However, they can also be used in any setting to help players specialize in how they wield their magic.

### Equation Master (Quandrix)
*Prerequisite : A spellcasting feature that grants spell slots*

You've learned how to mathematically manipulate your reserves of magical power for optimal efficiency.  You gain the following benefits:

* As an action or bonus action, you can expend two spell slots to regain one spell slot whose level is less than or equal to the sum of the expended spell slots.  You cannot regain a spell slot whose level is higher than your proficiency bonus.  <Br>You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all expended uses after you finish a long rest. 

* As an action or bonus action, you can expend a spell slot to regain two spell slots whose combined level is less than or equal to the level of the expended spell slot.

### Material Master (Witherbloom)
*Prerequisite : The ability to cast at least one spell*

You've learned to conjure magic using potions and other foraged materials.  You gain the following benefits:

* You can replace any spell's verbal, somatic, and material components with just a material component.  If the spell's material component doesn't have a gold cost, you can replace it with 1 pound of rations. If the spell doesn't normally have a material component, it gains a material component of 1 pound of rations when cast this way.

* When casting a spell that targets one or more creatures, you can use any magical potion as a spellcasting focus for that spell.  If the spell requires material components that don't have a gold cost, the potion serves as the material component. <br>When casting a spell this way, choose one of the creatures targeted by that spell.  That creature gains the potion's benefits as though it drank the potion, and the potion is consumed.  An unwilling creature can make a Constitution save against your spell save DC, negating the effect of the potion on a success.

* You gain advantage on checks made to cast <br> a spell of a higher level than you can normally <br> cast using a spell scroll. 

* You may cast a spell from a spell scroll without <br> consuming the scroll if the spell's level is equal <br> to or less than half your proficiency bonus <br> rounded up, and the spell does consume any <br> material components. Once you cast a spell this <br> way, you can't do so again until you finish a long <br> rest.

* Over the course of a long rest, you can bind <br> yourself to a spell scroll if the scroll's spell is <br> one you currently could learn from your class's <br> spellcasting feature. While bound to the scroll, <br> you can use the scroll as a spellcasting focus. <br> You can also cast the spell from the scroll <br> using a spell slot of the appropriate level. Once <br> you bind to a scroll, your bond with any other <br> scrolls ends.
