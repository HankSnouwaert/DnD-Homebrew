## Magical Chariots
The following vehicles are magical examples of chariots you can use in your games and as inspiration for creating your own chariots. They utilize the same chariot rules described in the Chariots document.



___

> ## Burning Chariot
>*Large Chariot, 60 lbs.*
> ___
> - **Armor Class** 18
> - **Hit Points**  171 (18d10 + 72)
> - **Damage Immunities**  Fire, Poison, Psychic
> - **Max Speed** 50ft. 
> - **Steed Capacity** 2 Large creatures
> - **Carriage Capacity** 4 Medium creatures
> - **Constitution Modifier** +4
> - **Challenge** 4 (1,100 XP)     
> ___
>
> ***Burning Tracks.*** Any ground the burning chariot moves through is set ablaze with fire for the next minute. A creature takes the 10 (3d6) fire damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.
>
> ### Steed Actions
>
> ***Heat Surge.*** If the chariot has moved at least 20 feet in a straight line this turn, its steeds may have flames shoot forward, filling a 10-foot square in front of each steed. Each creature caught in the flames must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Any ground in the area of the flames is then subjected to the effects of the chariot’s Burning Tracks feature.

These fiery vehicles are crafted for battle by powerful artisans or gifted to promising mortals by gods of war. They blaze across battlefields, reducing their foes to cinders.

### Chariot of the Wilds

These devices are utilized by powerful wood elf lords and other forest creatures. They can ride through the thickest forests with ease and even teleport through the trees.

### Winged Chariot
These flying vehicles are generally reserved for the use of divine beings who only rarely gift them to mortals. Such beings resent mortals who create or utilize them without divine consent and are often quick to strike down such upstarts.
