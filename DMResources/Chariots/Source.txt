## Chariot Combat Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage. Chariots and the creatures pulling them follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences: 

### Movement & Initiative

* Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs you 5 feet of movement, rather than a number of feet equal to half your speed. 

* Creatures pulling a chariot must all use their movement in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the creature with the least available movement.

* If the creatures pulling the chariot are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative, and they must take the same action on their turn.

* If the creatures pulling the chariot are acting independently, they all share the same initiative count of the creature with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order, but must move together.

* If an effect moves a chariot or any creature pulling it, the chariot and each creature pulling it are all moved together.

### Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with the full amount of creatures pulling them do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all the creatures pulling it make a Strength saving roll against the effect. Any creatures being subjected to the same effect use the roll they made for themselves. If any of the creatures succeeds on the save, the chariot passes the save. 

The same process is followed for Dexterity saving throws, except the chariot fails the save if any of the creatures fails the save, as it is much harder to pull a chariot out of harm's way in time.

#### Constitution Saves
While objects are technically immune to effects that require a Constitution save and this rarely causes game play issues, since chariots are active combatants it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal damage of a type they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. It may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by creatures.

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the standard size, HP, and AC attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Pulling Capacity
This the number of creatures required to pull the chariot and the required size of those creatures.

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number of creatures the chariots carriage can hold.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of the creatures pulling it.

### Carriage Features
Some chariots grant features to the creatures riding in their carriage.

### Pulling Features
Some chariots grant features such as new action options to the creatures pulling it.
