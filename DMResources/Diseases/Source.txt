# Diseases


## Disease Attributes

Any given disease can be described using the following attributes: 

### Transmission 
The means through which a creature can potentially contract the disease.  For example, being hit with a bite attack from an infected creature or being within 10 feet of an infected creature for 1 minute.  

### Saving Throw
The type of save and DC of that save that a creature must make if subjected to the conditions described by Transmission.  If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, it is not infected.  Unless stated otherwise, the creature that succeeds can still be forced to make the saving throw again if subjected to the transmission conditions again.

### Incubation Time  
The time between the contraction of the disease and the manifestation of the first symptoms.

### Starting Severity
Many diseases have different stages of severity, with each stage having its own symptoms.  This describes the severity creatures start with when they first contract the disease.

### Increasing Severity Rate
The time it takes the disease to potentially reach a higher level of severity.  At this point, the infected creature repeats the saving throw against the disease.  On a failure, the disease increases in severity. 

### Save DC Modifier
Some diseases become progressively easier or more difficult to cure as time goes on.  This describes the change to the save DC each time the infected creature makes a saving throw against the disease.

### Reversible Severity
This true/false statement describes whether a creature can naturally shrug off the effects of the disease without outside intervention.  If it is true, then whenever a creature succeeds on its saving throw against the disease increasing in severity, the severity of the disease decreases.  If the severity level reaches 0, the creature is cured of the disease.

### Cures
These are any outside effects that can cure a creature of a disease.  They could include anything from different types of potions and herbs to healing ceremonies performed at specific sacred sites.

### Severity Levels  
Descriptions of the symptoms at each severity level.

> ##### Who Rolls the Infection Save?
> When saving throws are being made to determine if a character is infected by a disease, they should usually be made in secret by the DM.  Player characters will usually only learn they have been infected once the first symptoms display themselves.

## Example Disease
This is an example

#### Some Disease
This is a description of the disease at a high level along with some interesting lore tidbits for added flavor.<br>
___
**Trasmission:** Starting your turn within 5 feet of an infected and symptomatic creature.<br>
**Saving Throw:** DC 13 Constitution Saving Throw <br>
**Incubation Time:** 24 Hours <br>
**Starting Severity:** 2 <br>
**Increasing Severity Rate:** Every 1 Hour <br>
**Save DC Modifier:** -1 <br>
**Reversible Severity:** True <br>
**Cures:** Eating an apple grown from a treant <br>
**Severity Levels:**

* **Severity 1:** Whenever the infected creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

* **Severity 2:** Whenever the infected creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

* **Severity 3:** Whenever the infected creature makes an attack roll or a saving throw, it must roll a d8 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. 


If you are running the example disease described above, a player character will need to be within five feet of an infected creature to risk contracting the disease.  Every time the character starts its turn close to the infected creature, you make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw for that character in secret.  Repeat this saving throw every time the character starts its turn within 5 feet of the infected creature until the character contracts the disease.  Do not tell the player if or when their character is infected.

If the character is infected, the symptoms described by Severity 2 will be experienced twenty-four hours later, at which point the player will learn their character is infected.  After an hour of being infected, the character makes another Constitution saving throw against the disease (which can now be made by the player.)   Because the DC modifier is -1, the save DC is now 14.  On a failed save, the character's symptoms increase to Severity 3, and on a successful save, they decrease to Severity 1.

The character continues to make saving throws each hour, with the save DC decreasing by 1 each time.  Failed saves move the severity up one level, and successful saves move it down one level.  This continues until the severity moves to 0, and which point the character is cured.

The disease can be ended early if the character consumes an apple grown from a treant or is subjected to a magical effect that removes diseases.
