#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

>
> ***Screaming Skull.*** Each howling skull catapult has 30 pieces of ammunition built into it that can be removed as needed. This ammunition lets out horrifying screeches that can be heard up to 300 feet away as long as it is within 30 feet of the catapult. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of any screaming ammunition and can hear it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.
>
> On a failure, the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 10), while the creature is frightened, it can't take reactions and must take the Dash action on each of its turns and move away from howling skull catapult by the safest available route.
>
> ### Functions
>
> ***Load.*** The weapon is loaded with a Cursed Skull. It must be prepped two times before it is loaded. It must be loaded before it can fire.
>
> ***Prep (2)*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done two times before it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The howling skull catapult fires a skull that is set ablaze and rains down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet and shatters. Each creature in a 15-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) piercing damage. Each non-undead creature within 30 feet of the point must then make a saving throw against the effects of the Screaming Skull feature.

___
> ## Hex Lightning Cannon 
> *Huge siege weapon (8,500 pounds lb.)*
> ___
> - **Weapon DC** 17
> - **Armor Class** 18 
> - **Hit Points** 150 (damage threshold: 10)
>___
> - **Damage Immunities** poison, psychic
> - **Ammo** Hex Lighting Core (6 rounds, 1,000g).
> - **Challenge** 5 (1,800 XP)
> ___
>
> ### Functions
>
> ***Load.*** The weapon is loaded with a Hex Lightning Core. This must be done before it is prepped.
>
> ***Prep (2)*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done while it is loaded. It must be prepped two times before it can fire.
>
>
> ***Fire.*** The weapon fires a line of lightning that forms a line 4d4 x 10 feet long and 5 feet wide, which blasts out from it in the direction of user's choice. Each creature in the line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried. If three or more of the d4s rolled have the same number, the weapon has a mishap. If it has half its health or less, it has a mishap if two or more d4s roll the same number. If a mishap occurs, resolve it before having the weapon fire.
