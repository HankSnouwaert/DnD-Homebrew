# Chaos Mutations

The twisting power of Chaos carries an unpredictable quality in its corruption, bestowing a wide range of deadly traits upon individuals. In places where Chaos has deeply seeped into the land, there are records of monsters unlike anything seen elsewhere in the world—wolf-like creatures with jagged beaks whose saliva can dissolve metal; massive predatory cats that melt into shadows and scale the sheer stone walls of fortresses to feed on inhabitants within; and even strange, wicked humanoids with hides thicker than leather, constantly shifting and warping to ward off attack. Accounts of these bizarre deviations and their horrific exploits are numerous. Yet no two records ever share a description of the exact same miscreation.

The following mechanics provide various mutations you can apply to existing creatures to represent the warping effect Chaos (or any other power appropriate to your setting) has had on that creature. This can provide surprise twists on creatures players are familiar with that challenge them in new ways and meaningfully display the power of Chaos to distort everything it touches.

> ##### Using Mutations To Create Urgency In Adventures
> If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with minions of chaos
  and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the creatures in the adventure gain mutations as time passes. This means the more slowly and carefully the players progress, the more dangerous they will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. 
> 
> If you want the mutations to be random, you can roll a d20 (or 1d6 for beastmen mutations) to determine what mutation they will gain.
>
> The rate at which they gain mutations could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.

## Chaos Mutation List

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any creature to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them. The creature receiving the mutation is referred to as the "mutant."

Applying a mutation increases a mutant's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

To pick a mutation at random, roll 1d20 and match the result to the number of the mutation.

##### Mutation Save DC

If a mutation force a creature to make a Saving throw or check, the DC is equal to 10 + it's Proficiency Bonus

### Mutations

#### 1. Acidic Secretions

*The beast’s claws, teeth, or other natural weapons drip with corrosive fluids, capable of reducing a victim to a delectable slurry should the caustic substance make contact.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) acid damage and the creature is covered in acid until it or a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. While covered in acid, it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the end of each of its turns.


#### 2. Adaptive Defense

*Should one manage to wound the beast, its body begins to twist and change. Within seconds, it adapts into a new form impervious to the attacker’s strikes.*

The mutant gains the following Reaction:

***Adaptive Defense (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** *Trigger:* When the mutant takes damage. *Response:* The mutant becomes immune to the triggering damage type for the next minute. (This does not negate the damage that triggered the reaction.)


#### 3. Earth-Ripping Claws

*With massive paws or chitinous blades, the beast moves through the earth like a fish through water. Lurking below, it waits for the telltale vibrations of prey above before it strikes.*

The mutant has a burrow speed of 20 feet and Tremorsense out to 30 feet.


#### 4. Expeditious Metabolism

*The creature can digest blood, flesh, and bone within seconds, rapidly converting the carnage into fuel to restore its own body.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, it regains 20 hit points.

\pagebreakNum

#### 5. Gnarled Hide

*The beast's hide has toughened up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The mutant gets +3 to its AC


#### 6. Gouging Tusks

*The beast has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn, if the mutant has moved 20+ feet straight toward a target immediately before it hits with the enhanced weapon, the target takes an extra 17 (5d6) piercing damage.


#### 7. Many Limbed Monster

*The beast sports an extra pair of limbs to tear at its enemies.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons.

When the mutant takes the Attack action, it makes one additional attack as part of the action, which uses the attack modifier of the chosen weapon for the attack roll. On hit, the target takes 14 (4d6) slashing damage.


#### 8. Regeneration

*No amount of slicing, stabbing, or thrashing will keep it down for long. Muscles regrow, skin stitches itself closed, bones snap back into place—and the beast rises once more.*

The mutant regains 15 hit points at the start of its turn. If the mutant takes fire or acid damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the mutant's next turn. The mutant dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.


#### 9. Infesting Injector

*The beast can implant parasitic organisms into other creatures—whether they are grotesque organisms it harbors or its own repulsive young.*

Once per turn, when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, parasites burrow into target's flesh, infesting it. While infested, the creature takes 10 (3d6) damage. Any creature within reach can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check to remove the parasites using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, causing 1d6 damage of the same type to the target. On a successful check, the effect ends. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the parasites, but if it does, the target takes 2d6 damage instead.


#### 10. Shadow Hide

*The beast's black fur melds perfectly with the darkness around it, allowing it to stalk its prey from the shadows while completely unseen.*

While in darkness, the mutant is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness. Additionally, it gets a +5 on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on checks from wearing armor.

\columnbreak

#### 11. Shredding Implement

*The beast’s claws, beak, horns, or other natural weapons grow jagged and barbed, tearing muscles into tattered, useless strands.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn, when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, the target suffers a rending wound. While wounded, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution d20 Tests, and its speed is halved. The wound ends if the target regains 15 or more hit points at once or if the target, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to stanch the wound by succeeding on a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check.


#### 12. Slug-Skin

*This beastman's disgusting skin oozes thick, slippery, toxic slime.*

At the end of the mutant's turn, any ground within 5 feet of it is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain.

A creature standing on the slime has disadvantage on Dexterity and Strength saving throws, and prone creatures in the area must spend all their movement to stand up instead of half. If a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. Any creature with this mutation ignores its effects.


#### 13. Snatching Appendage

*Whether a chameleon-like tongue, mantis-like limbs, or a grotesquely elongated arm, the beast can strike with lightning speed and drag its ill-gotten prize away—screaming.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

The enhanced weapon has its reach extended by 15 feet. On hit, the target is grappled and pulled 15 feet towards the creature.


#### 14. Sneak Attack

*Driven by malevolent cunning, the beast exploits even the most minuscule of gaps in its opponents' defenses, striking with terrifying precision.*

Once per turn, the mutant deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the mutant that isn't incapacitated and the mutant doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.


#### 15. Splendid Mantle

*This beast is adorned with especially grandiose features—twisting horns, vibrant feathered plumes, or some other majestic trait. Granting it an arrogant confidence, fully aware it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

If the mutant is not bloodied, it gets +5 to all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

\pagebreakNum


#### 16. Springing Legs

*The beast can launch itself staggering distances, crashing down upon the unprepared.*

Once per turn, the mutant can jump up to 40 feet by spending 10 feet of movement. If the mutant has jumped 20+ feet straight toward a target immediately before it hits with an attack, it gains advantage on the attack roll.


#### 17. Sticky Smear 

*The beast is able to Release clinging webbing or thick mucus, which immobilize anything caught within.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn, when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, the creature is restrained by sticky mucus or webbing until it is destroyed (AC 15; HP 20; immune to bludgeoning, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage).


#### 18. Uncanny Senses

*The beast's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*

The mutant gets +5 on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 30 feet.


#### 19. Unsettling Scuttle

*Insectoid limbs lined with barbed hairs allow the beast to move in an off-putting, unpredictable manner. It skitters effortlessly across any terrain, bypassing foes without pause or penalty.*

The mutant has a climb speed equal to its walking speed and can climb on difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.


#### 20. Vile Toxins

*The beast’s venom is so potent that even the slightest scratch can deliver a fatal dose, sapping away life in mere seconds.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn, when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, the target must make a Constitution Saving Throw. *Failure:* The target is poisoned for the next minute. While poisoned, it can't regain hit points. At the end of each of its turns, the poisoned creature repeats the Constitution Saving Throw. *Success:* It ends the poison. *Failure:* It takes 14 (4d6) poison damage.

### Beastmen Mutations List

The following is a list of mutations that can only be applied to beastmen.


#### 1. Arcane Fury

*The beastman’s horns act as arcane conduits, drawing in powerful magic and infusing it with potent mystic vigor.*

The beastman gains the following reaction:

 *Trigger:* When another creature within 15 feet of the beastman casts a 1st or higher level spell. *Response:* The beastman enters a frenzy. If the beastman already frenzied, it may move up to half its speed and make a single gore attack. The attack has advantage if it is made against the creature that triggered the ability.



#### 2. Cursed Tongue

*Humility is anathema to the beastman. Should another cause it to appear weak or foolish, it responds by weaving a hex in its foul language—inflicting it upon the source of its shame.*

When the beastman loses its frenzy from missing with all of its attacks against the same creature on the same turn, it may curse a creature. It may also curse a creature when it loses its frenzy due to being charmed or frightened by a creature. The curse lasts for one minute, until the beastman enters its frenzy again, or until the beastman dies. While cursed, whenever a target makes a d20 test, the target must subtract 1d6 from the roll. A creature can be cursed this way by more than one beastman at a time, and the effects stack.


#### 3. Disfiguring Hate

*The beastman’s fury warps its visage into a grotesque mask of rage. Its guttural roars of loathing echo forth, while a slick, rancid sweat seeps from its flesh, carrying a stench so hateful it stings the eyes—a living nightmare of repulsion.*

The beastman emits an aura in a 30-foot emanation from itself while it is frenzied which forces creatures to make the following saving throw. *Wisdom Saving Throw:* Each enemy that starts its turn in the emanation. *Failure:* The creature is frightened of all frenzied creatures until the start of its next turn. If a creature would make multiple saving throws against the Disfiguring Hate abilities of multiple beastmen, it instead makes a single saving throw. The save DC equals the highest save DC among the beastmen plus 2 per saving throw that was forgone.


#### 4. Fetid Soul

*So drenched in festering hatred is the beastman’s spirit that, as it tears free from its corpse in death, the vile essence fouls all it touches—leaving rot and hate in its wake.*

When the beastman dies while it is frenzied, it explodes, forcing creatures to make the following saving throw. *Constitution Saving Throw:* Each non-beastman creature within a 10-foot emanation of the beastman when it dies. *Failure:* The creature takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and suffers a level of exhaustion. Success: Half damage only. Each beastman in the emanation enters a frenzy if it is not already in one.

\pagebreakNum


#### 5. Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorts the flow of magic around it.*

If the beastman fails a saving throw against a spell while frenzied, it can choose to end the frenzy and succeed instead. If the beastman would take half damage on a success, it instead takes no damage.

\columnbreak

#### 6. Wounded Rage

*Deep wounds and broken bones only drive the beastman to strive harder, dreading the judgment of its dark gods should it die in failure.* 

If the beastman is bloodied and frenzied, it has advantage on attack rolls, and its attacks deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage on hit.
