# New Conditions

#### Berserk
The creature is consumed by bloodlust, giving it the following effects:
 * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear. 
* The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
* Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.

#### Burning
The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
* **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
* **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
* **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

#### Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

> ##### Notes on 2024 Burning Rules
> If you're using the rules for burning described in the 2024 edition of D&D, these are the changes that were made in this document:
> * **Sources of Burning Don't Stack.** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
> * **Damage At End of Turn.** Burning damage occurs at the end of a creature's turn rather than the beginning. This gives the creature the chance to try to end the condition before taking the damage, thus giving players more agency when they start burning.

#### Drowsy 
This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
* It moves at half speed.<br>
* It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
*  It can't concentrate. <br>
* Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
* The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

#### Emboldened  
The creature experiences a rush of confidence and aggression that it maintains so long as it feels like it's winning the fight.
 * The Emboldened condition always lasts one minute.
 * An Emboldened creature deals additional 7 (2d6) damage when it hits with a attack.
 * At the end of the creature's turn, the Emboldened condition ends early if it missed with all of its attacks that turn, it is charmed or frightened, or is effected by *calm emotions* spell. 

#### Fatigue
The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
* **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
* **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
* **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.

**Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.

**Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue. 


#### Fury  
The creature gains levels of Fury that cause its attacks to deal increasing amounts of damage with each level.
 * The creature can only gain levels of Fury during combat, and all levels are lost when combat ends.
 * A creature can gain up to a max of 6 levels of Fury.
 * First time each turn the creature hits a target with an attack, it deals an additional 1d4 damage for each level of Fury it has.
 * A creature also loses all levels of Fury if it becomes Charmed or Frightened, or is affected by the *calm emotions* spell.  It also can't gain levels Fury while under these conditions.

#### Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.



##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|

#### Obsessed 
The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

#### Quickened
A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.





#### Rampaging
The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
* On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
* The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
* Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.

#### Resolute
The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
 * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
 * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
 * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
 
The condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.


#### Wounds
While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:

 * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
 * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
 * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.
