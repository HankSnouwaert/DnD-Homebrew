# River Navigation
When traveling over great distances, rivers can be a boon for adventurers.  Rivers provide a consistent land feature that prevents travelers from becoming lost, they are usually a source of plentiful food and drinkable water, and they can be traveled by boat to reach distant locations quickly.  However, they also present natural hazards, and often attract dangerous predators.

## Travel Activities
When the players are traveling long distances overland, rivers can play a large part in their journey.  You may choose to modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players interact with a river.

### Travel Pace
If the players are traveling by foot alongside a river, it has no significant impact on their travel pace unless the terrain becomes more difficult to navigate.  If the players are traveling by boat, the direction and speed of the river current effects their travel pace.

\columnbreak

When traveling via paddle boat in still or gently flowing water, characters travel at a normal pace.  If the current is stronger and they are going downstream, they can travel at a fast pace without suffering the normal drawbacks of doing so.  

If they are traveling upstream against a strong current, they cannot travel at a fast pace, traveling at a normal pace results in suffering the drawbacks normally associated with traveling at a fast pace, and traveling at a slow pace does not provide its usual benefits.

### Navigation
One of the great advantages of traveling on or near a river, is that it serves as a constant point of reference.  If the characters' navigate by following the river, they cannot become lost unless there are many other rivers splitting from it, leaving it unclear which to follow.

### Foraging
Another benefit afforded by rivers is that they usually provide ready access to food and freshwater.  Unless the river is strangely devoid of life, or it has been polluted, it should generally be treated as though it provides an abundance of food and water sources for the purposes of harvesting.

## River Hazards
Rivers can vary greatly in their danger <br> level, whether they are being crossed or <br> boated on.  From slow, lazy rivers to raging <br> rapids and waterfalls, there are a variety of <br> conditions characters can face.

### Obstructions
These hazards can range from natural features like fallen trees and large rocks, to constructed structures like dams or collapsed bridges.  In any case, they represent an obstacle which allows water through but hinders the progress of boats.  If the obstruction consists of smaller scattered obstacles, you can treat it the same way you would rapids, detailed below.  If the obstruction is large enough to totally bar travel via boat, the characters will be forced to climb over it with their boat, or dock and pull their boat across land until they pass the clearing. 

#### Climbing the Obstruction
If the players try to pull their boat across the obstruction, have them make a group Strength check to see if they successfully make it with their boat to the other side. If one of the characters passes the check by 10 or more, the whole group automatically passes.  If they fail, the boat is dropped and takes bludgeoning damage.  The DC of the check determines the amount of bludgeoning damage taken, as shown on the Rapids and Obstructions table.

#### Circumventing the Obstruction
If the players decide to dock and pull their boat around the obstacle, it should be enough of an inconvenience that it impedes their travel for the day or puts in them in danger.  Docking and moving around the obstacle could leave them open to an attack, or the nature of the terrain may force them to divert their journey away from the river as they search for a way to approach it again. 

### Rapids
This is among the most common and dangerous river hazards. Beyond just consisting of fast currents, rapids often include a variety of hazards such as sharp rocks, foot entrapments, undercuts, and holes.  Undercuts are locations where there is room for the water to flow, such as under a rock, but not for boats and creatures, which can lead to dangerous collisions. Holes involve points in the river where the water's current flows over a rock and suddenly dives to the bottom of the river, pulling creatures and objects with it.

#### Boating
When traveling via boat through an area of intense rapids, the character paddling must make a Strength (Athletics) check to attempt to navigate it safely, and if a group of characters are paddling, they make a group check.  If one of the characters passes the check by 10 or more, the whole group automatically passes.  If they fail, the boat slams into rocks and takes bludgeoning damage dependent on the intensity of the rapids as shown in the Rapids and Obstructions table.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Crossing on Foot
If characters find themselves attempting to navigate across rapids by foot, each one must make the Strength check to attempt to cross the waters safely.  This check is made with disadvantage if the character is unable to stand in the water or has just been thrown into it.  If a character fails this check, it is immediately pulled a number of feet downstream equal to the check's DC.  If it collides with a rock or other hard object, the character takes the corresponding bludgeoning damage listed in the Rapids and Obstructions table.  The character makes this check again at the start of each of its turns, getting pulled further downstream each time it fails.


##### Rapids and Obstructions
|      Hazard DC       | Bludgeoning Damage |
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|           10         |         2d6          |
|           15         |         4d6          | 
|           20         |         6d6          |
|           25         |         8d6          |
|           30         |         10d6         |

### Waterfalls
When rapids result in a sudden plunge from a far enough height, they become a waterfall.  The heights these drops can reach depends on the type of terrain the river is running through.  The table below can be used to create a waterfall of a random height that suits a given terrain.  

Waterfalls often present major obstacles to characters traveling by river, and can force them to take major detours, or abandon their attempt at traveling by river entirely. 

|   Terrain Type  | Waterfall Height  |
|:---------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Low Hills     |     1d4 x 10ft    |
|   Large Hills   |     1d6 x 10ft    |
|   Highlands     |     1d8 x 10ft    |
| Small Mountains |      1d10 x 10ft  |
|Mountainous Cliffs|     1d12 x 10ft  |

## Example Random Encounter Tables
The following are different river environments across different levels of gameplay, complete with random encounter tables you can use when the players are traversing them.  You can plug these right into your games, modify them to better suit your campaign, or simply use them as inspiration for creating and running your own river encounters.

Each river has a DC determining the difficulty in foraging, and an activity level suggesting how often to roll for a random encounter.  Creature names with asterisks have new stat blocks listed at the end of the document.

### Loblolly River (Level 1-4)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 4 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 10 <br>
This river meanders through the wooded hills of a small kingdom, lazily passing villages as it goes.  Though it is often used as a means of transport between towns, travelers must be wary of the dangers the unassuming river poses.  Bandits will set traps for merchant boats, and aggressive river animals will spontaneously attack travelers.  Though bandits and dangerous wildlife pose the most direct threat, the locals are most suspicious of the river fairies known for playing pranks on any who cross their path.

### Akhmuten River (Level 5-10)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 4 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 15 <br>
This calm river runs through an otherwise arid wasteland, providing the most significant source of water in the region.  Civilization flocks to it, as do all manor of ferocious beast.  Kingdoms have risen and fallen along the river’s banks, and many of the crumbling temples looming over its waters are no longer inhabited by their original creators.  

The humans living here have an uneasy relationship with the crocodile worshipping lizardfolk who dwell along the untamed stretches of river and in the ruins of temples lost to previous generations.  Though outright aggression between settlements is avoided by both groups, the lizardfolk have no qualms about preying upon stray travelers who don’t have anything of value to offer them.

### Crag Tooth River (Level 11-16)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 3 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 20 <br>
This river runs through a treacherous, mountain valley, with other streams constantly feeding into it.  As the river charts its course through the crags, it forms deadly rapids and massive waterfalls.  These mountains are home to large and dangerous beasts, and once housed a military output built atop its highest peak, near the mountain spring which serves as the river’s source.  The abundance of food and ideally placed keep eventually caught the eye of Shirrys, a red dragon who declared war on the keep’s defenders.  After a long bitter battle, the keep was lost and became her lair. 

Now, Shirrys and her children rule the valley and hunt its inhabitants with impunity.  As a result, few people attempt to traverse it, though soldiers continue to scout the area in hopes of finding a way to retake their mountain holdings.  For those braving the journey, the river provides one of the few reliable ways of navigating the crags without becoming lost, and subsequently dragon food.  Those who follow it to its source will find a mountain spring scorched bare by dragon fire and the charred remains of those who challenged the valley’s new ruler.

### River Styx (Level 17-20)
**Activity Rating:** 1 Encounter per 3 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 25 (Disadvantage unless *Remove Curse* spell is used while foraging)<br>
This legendary river crosses the lower planes of the multiverse, linking together multiple underworlds and serving as a common mode of transportation for fiends.  Those who drink from its waters are said to lose all memory of their past lives, and lost souls as well as other underworld creatures can often be found crossing its waters. 

A creature that drinks from the Styx or enters its waters is targeted by a *feeblemind* spell (save DC 20). A creature must repeat the saving throw whenever it starts its turn in the river, until it fails the save. A feebleminded creature can drink from the Styx and swim in its waters without suffering any additional effects.
If a creature fails its saving throw and remains under the spell's effect for 30 consecutive days, the effect becomes permanent (no save) and the creature loses all its memories, becoming a near-mindless shell of its former self. At that point, nothing short of a wish spell or divine intervention can undo the effect.
