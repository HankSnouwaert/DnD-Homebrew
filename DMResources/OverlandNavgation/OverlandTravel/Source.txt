# Overland Travel
The following rules are modifications to the standard rules and guidelines relating to overland travel laid out in the *Player's Handbook* and *Dungeon Master's Guide*.  They are intended for play groups that wish to make long distance, overland travel a more meaningful part of their adventures.

## Rations and Long Rests
These rules assume characters don't automatically regain all their health and half their hit die over a long rest.  
In order to regain hit points and hit die over a long rest, a character must consume additional food and water beyond the normal day's worth of rations.

> ##### Variant Encumbrance Rules
> In order to to make the amount of rations players choose to carry with them a meaningful choice, it is recommended you use the variant encumbrance rules on page 176 of the PHB


### Regaining Hit Die

For every pound of food and gallon of water consumed throughout the day, the character can regain 1 hit die over their next long rest, up to a maximum of half their total character level.  

### Regaining Hit Points

Characters still must consume a baseline of 1 pound of food and 1 gallon of water to avoid exhaustion effects as stated in the PHB.  However, if a character wishes to regain hit points over a long rest, an additional 1 pound of food and 1 gallon of water must be consumed for every 1/4 of the character's maximum hit points that is restored (rounded up).

## Travel Activities
The following rules are a change to the navigation and foraging activities described in the DMG.

### Navigation

If the players are attempting any sort of overland travel in which they don't have an obvious path to follow, such as following a road or river, at least one of the characters must take up the activity of navigation in order to prevent the players from becoming lost.

One Wisdom (Survival) check is made per day by one of the party's characters to determine whether they stay on course or get lost.  The DM makes this roll in secret at the end of each day of travel, and the DC is determined by the type of environment the group is traveling through. 

If the party traveled the whole day at a slow pace, add +5 to the result rolled.  If the party traveled at a fast pace at any point during the day, apply -5 to the result rolled.  If the party has an accurate map of the area, make this check with advantage. On a success, the group successfully makes travel progress towards their destination, and the process repeats until the players reach their destination.

### Becoming Lost

If the party fails their Wisdom (Survival) check to navigate, the DM randomly determines the direction the party traveled in, with the players unaware that they are lost.  It is possible the party will happen to travel in the correct direction, in which case they continue to make progress towards their destination.

This process is repeated at the end of each day of travel, and if the player's are lost, they won't realize it until they pass another Wisdom (Survival) check, or they notice inconsistencies in their journey with what they were expecting.  If they pass their Wisdom (Survival) check while lost, the DM can inform the players they are lost either at the end of their day of travel or at the beginning of the next day.  

Discovering they are lost this way does not necessarily mean the players now know where they are.  If there are visible landmarks that are consistent with their knowledge of the area, the players may be to reorient themselves, or at least make an educated guess as to where they ended up.

In any case, a group that realizes it is lost can attempt to set a new course, repeating the navigation the process described above.  Options for setting a new course could include backtracking until they are back on route, or traveling in the direction of a known landmark so as to reorient their location.  If the players drew a map as they traveled, then this can be used to provide advantage on their navigation checks when backtracking.

### Foraging
A foraging check should be made once per day by any character participating in the activity, using Wisdom (Survival) as stated in the DMG.

In order to add more challenge to managing resources while traveling, change the results of a successful forraging check to provide 1 pound of food and 1 gallon of water on a success.  For ever 5 over the foraging DC the character rolls, an additional pound of food and gallon of water is harvested.

Foraging is best done when the party is traveling at a slow pace.  If the party travels at a medium pace, checks to forage are made with disadvantage, and if the party is moving at a fast pace, foraging is impossible

## Random Encounters

The DMG contains guidelines on rolling for random encounters while the players are traveling, including how often the DM should roll to determine if there's a random encounter based on how much activity is in the area.  The following rules define more specific guidelines for how DMs can determine when to roll for random encounters while the players are making long stretches of overland travel.

### When to Roll for An Encounter
As per the DMG, how often the DM rolls for a random encounter depends on how active the environment.  To simplify this process, assign the environment an Activity Rating between 1 and 5, which represents roughly how many encounters per day you would expect.  The higher the Activity Rating, the more often you will roll to see if there's an encounter.  Barren wastelands may have an Activity Rating of 1, while environments teeming with creatures and NPCs may have an activity rating of 5.

You can use the table below to match the environment's Activity Rating with how much time spent in it should warrant a check for a random encounter.  


##### Random Encounter Rolling
| Activity Rating |  Number of Hours <br> Per Roll    | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1            |      12       |
|  2            |      6        | 
|  3            |      4        |
|  4            |      3        |
|  5            |      2        |


To roll for a random encounter, roll a **d20**.  If the result is **11 or higher**, a random encounter occurs.  

> ##### Deviation from the DMG
> The DMG states that a random encounter occurs on a roll of 18 or higher.  This was changed to make random encounters more common, and thus more impactful

#### Alternative Encounter <br> Rolling Rules
If you would rather roll for encounters the same number of times per day, regardless of the environment, this alternative rule will provide a similar amount of encounters per day for any given environment.

For every 4 hours the players spend in a given environment, roll a d6.  If the result is less than or equal to the environment's activity rating, roll for a random encounter.

\columnbreak

### Creating Encounter Tables
The DMG provides guidelines for creating encounter tables you can roll on to generate random encounters for players.  Encounters can involve dangers such as hostile creatures and environmental hazards, or interesting discovers and opportunities, such as traveling NPCs, abandoned items, or hidden landmarks, any of which could provide a lead in to an optional side quest.

#### Environment Danger Rating
When determining how many of the encounters on a random encounter table should be hostile or hazardous, it is useful to set a danger rating for the given environment.  The rating can be anywhere between 1 and 5, and it represents roughly how many of the random encounters players face will be a threat.

When creating the encounter table, the percentage of threatening encounters should be roughly equal to the environment's danger rating divided by its activity rating.  For example, if the environment has an activity rating of 4 and a danger rating of 3, then roughly 3/4s of the encounters on the environment's encounter table should represent some sort of danger or obstacle to the players.  The environment's danger rating cannot be higher than its activity rating.

The following are examples of environments that may be represented with different danger ratings.

##### 1: Civilized Territory or Empty Wasteland
Environments such as these are ether primarily occupied by non hostile creatures that maintain it, or they are so empty players aren't likely to run into many hostile forces.  Rural farmlands and trackless deserts would be examples of such environments. In such environments players should have an average of 1 hostile encounter per day.

##### 2: Mundane Wilderness
These environments are typically uncivilized frontiers that have a relatively low amount of hostile creatures or hazards.  Most mundane forests and mountain passes would be examples of such environments.  In such environments players should have an average of 2 hostile encounters per day.

##### 3: Hostile Wilderness
These environments are typically filled hostile inhabitants and hazards that make them dangerous to cross.  Jungles, fetid swamps, and forests with an unusually high number of predators would be examples of such environments.  In such environments players should have an average of 3 hostile encounters per day.

##### 4: Enemy Territory
These environments are typically filled inhabitants that will actively hunt the players should their presence be detected, or they are supernatural locations, often on other planes. A forest home to goblin tribes, a haunted moor riddles with ghosts, or an enchanted forest in the Feywild could all be examples of such an environment. In such environments players should have an average of 4 hostile encounters per day.

\pagebreak

##### 5: Extremely Hostile Territory
These environment either represent the most hostile locales in the multiverse, or they are places under the control of a hostile force that is actively hunting the players.  The lower levels of the Abyss or the territory of a hobgoblin nation state that's actively hunting down the players could both be examples of such an environment.  In such environments players should have an average of 5 to 6 hostile encounters per day.

> ##### Setting the Challenge Rating
> The Environment's Danger Rating is related to how often players will encounter dangerous encounters, but not the CR of those encounters.  When creating the encounter table, it may be useful to define what you want the average CR of the encounters this wilderness provides to be.

### Example Environments
The following are examples of environments the players may find themselves traveling through.  These environments can be used as they are or serve as inspiration for creating your own unique environments for your own adventures. 

#### Encounter Table: Thunder Ridge
**Level Range:** 11-16 <br>
**Activity Rating:** 3 <br>
**Danger Rating:** 2 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 15 <br>
**Foraging DC:** 20 <br>

This lonely mountain range serves as a buffer between two kingdoms.  Though there are passes through the Thunder Ridge, and they are relatively uninhabited, few travelers attempt this journey, as the creatures living here are quite deadly and many fear the ancient, giant ruins that dot the mountain range. 

Because the Activity Rating is 3 and the Danger Rating is 2, approximately 2/3s of the encounters on the table are dangerous obstacles.  The remainder are less dangerous discoveries or optional side quests.  

##### Thunder Ridge Encounters
| d20 | Encounter     | 
|:---:|:-------------:|
|  1  | A group of 1d8 + 1 **basilisks**        |
|  2  | A party of 1d8 + 1 hungry **ettins** |

|  11 | A pair of **young red dragons** patrolling the <br> mountains from the skies   |
|  12 | A massive thunder storm   |
|  13 | A rock slide        |
|  14 | A wide crevasse, blocking the way forward   | 
|  15 | The remains of a giant watch tower, built <br>  into the mountain side. Its entrance blocked <br> by an iron gate     |
|  16 | The charred remains of a stone giant     |
|  14 | Giant runes etched into a mountain face, <br> depicting a battle between dragons and giants      |
|  15 | A **cloud giant** offering to reward players <br> if they can retrieve a family heirloom <br> from a collapsed ruin     |
|  16 | A traveling merchant caravan coming from <br> the other direction    |
|  17 | A group of dwarven surveyors looking for <br> mining prospects    |
|  18 | An abandoned mine built by fire giants   |
|  19 | A pair of inert **stone golem** sentries <br> standing watch over the entrance to a <br> ruined keep. They  spring to life and attack <br> any humanoid that  attempts to enter the keep   |
|  20 | A ruined, giant castle now occupied <br> by an **adult red dragon** and its minions  |

#### Encounter Table: Skydale Farmlands
**Level Range:** 1-4 <br>
**Activity Rating:** 5 <br>
**Danger Rating:** 1 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 10 <br>
**Foraging DC:** 10 <br>

This rural farming area is made up of fields of crops divided by crisscrossing dirt roads.  This region is busy, but relatively safe, with most of its inhabitants made up of farmers and traveling merchants.

Because the Activity Rating is 5 and the Danger Rating is 1, approximately 1/5 of the encounters on the table are dangerous obstacles.  The remainder are less dangerous discoveries or optional side quests.  

##### Skydale Farmlands Encounters
| d20 | Encounter     | 
|:---:|:-------------:|
| 1-4 | A farmer's family trying to sell their goods <br> to travelers        |
| 5-8 | A traveling merchant heading to the nearest city | 
| 9-11| A roadside shop/tavern    | 
|  12 | A friendly guard patrol   |
|  13 | A gang of XdX **bandits**     |
|  14 | A group of XdX corrupt **gaurds** looking to <br> extort money from travelers        |
|  15 | An escaped heard of stampeding cattle    |


\pagebreakNum

|  |      | 
|:---:|:-------------:|
|  16 | A fierce thunderstorm, accompanied  by twisters   |
|  17 | An abandoned wagon   |
|  18 | An eerie scarecrow watching over <br> a desolate and empty field   |
|  19 | A group farmers trying to rescue a child <br> who has fallen down a well        |
|  20 | A farmer running up the road, screaming <br> that his farm is under attack   | 


#### Example Encounter Table: Dread Wastes
**Level Range:** 17-20 <br>
**Activity Rating:** 2 <br>
**Danger Rating:** 2 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 25 <br>
**Foraging DC:** 30 <br>
This cursed wasteland is hostile towards all life.  The inhabitants it houses are mostly undead, and few are brave or mad enough to attempt to cross it. 

Food and water is scarce, and almost anything that is found is tainted.  If whom ever is foraging expends a use of the spell *Purify Food and Drink*, they get advantage on their Wisdom (Survival) check to forage.

Because the Activity Rating is 2 and the Danger Rating is 2, nearly all of the encounters on the table are dangerous obstacles. 

##### Dread Wastes Encounters
| d10 | Encounter     | 
|:---:|:-------------:|
|  1  | A massive sandstorm, with the sand forming a malevolent face in its center, races towards the party    |
|  2  | A swarm of unholy locusts descends on the party.  Any food or water it touches is spoiled.  |
|  3  | A group of 3d6 **wight** desert raiders lead by a **death knight**, all of them riding skeletal horses |
|  4  | 1 **adult blue dracolich**  |
|  5  | 1d4 hours of extreme heat  |
|  6  | 5 square miles sand buried dead.  Every 2d4 minutes spent in this area, 4d6 **mummies** burst from the ground
|  7  | A **vampire lord** and 3d6 **vampire spawn** resting in the remains of a long abandoned town with a dark cloud hanging overhead
|  8  | A half buried pyramid, home to a **mummy lord**
|  9  | A set of stone stairs going down a dark tunnel that leads into death trap created by a **demilich**
|  10 | A dark figure in the distance, slowly slouching towards the party


#### Example Encounter Table: Blood Coast
**Level Range:** 5-10 <br>
**Activity Rating:** 4 <br>
**Danger Rating:** 3 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 0 <br>
**Foraging DC:** 15 <br>

This coastline is currently a warzone being fought over by groups of pirates and bloodthirsty sahuagin.  Navigating up and down the coast is trivial, but avoiding the attention of the coast's murderous combatants is another matter.

Because the Activity Rating is 4 and the Danger Rating is 3, approximately 3/4s of the encounters on the table are dangerous obstacles.  The remainder are less dangerous discoveries or optional side quests.  

##### Blood Coast Encounters
| d20 | Encounter     | 
|:---:|:-------------:|
| 1-2 | 1d6 + 2 **sahuagin**        |
| 3-4 | 2d4 pirate **scouts** |
| 5-6 | 3d6 **sahuagin**    | 
| 7-8 | 2d4 pirate **thugs**   |
|  9  | A pirate crew consisting on 1 **bandit captain**, 1 <br>**druid**, 2 **berserkers**, and 2d12 **bandits**      |
|  10 | 1 **sahuagin baron** with 1d3 **sahuagin priestessess** <Br> and 2d8 **sahuagin**       |
|  11 | 2d4 **ghouls** feeding on corpses that have <br> washed ashore    |
|  12 | 2d6 **giant eagles** hunting for stray combatants  |
|  13 | An enraged **water elemental** containing the <br> blood of fallen combatants   |
|  14 | A massive thunder storm   |
|  15 | A tidal wave        |
|  16 | A dead pirate with a crumpled map clutched in his or her hand   | 
|  17 | A half buried chest, jutting out of the sands     |
|  18 |  A lone pirate **scout** or **sahuagin** cut off from allies and willing to trade information of the area for food and supplies   |
|  19 | A nearby ship at sea being assaulted by sahuagin raiders     |
|  20 | A beach side battle consisting of the pirate forces from result 9 of this table fighting the sahuagin forces from the result of roll 10      |

#### Example Encounter Table: Ghost Wood
**Level Range:** 6-10 <br>
**Activity Rating (Day):** 3 <br>
**Activity Rating (Night):** 5 <br>
**Danger Rating (Day):** 1 <br>
**Danger Rating (Night):** 5 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 20 <br>
**Foraging DC:** 20 <br>

By day, the Ghost Wood is deathly silent.  It's gray, leafless trees house almost no life and a sense of foreboding hangs heavy in the air.  Few are willing to travel through this cursed forest, and those that do are careful to only do so during daylight hours.  That is easier said than done though, as these woods are deceptively difficult to navigate. Those that fail to escape the forest before nightfall will be subject to an untold number of horrors from beyond the grave. 

\pagebreakNum

The activity and danger ratings of these environment change from day to night, and there are separate encounter tables to represent this.

##### Ghost Wood Encounters (Day)
| d10 | Encounter     | 
|:---:|:-------------:|
|  1  | A lone noose hanging from a dead tree.  When not observed directly, a body can sometimes briefly be seen hanging from it   |
|  2  | A 10 foot by 10 foot ritualistic symbol on the ground, drawn in blood  |
|  3  | Whispering voices beckoning travelers off their path and deeper into the woods  |
|  4  | A hastily scrawled letter on the ground, it's writer begging for help  |
|  5  | Abandoned children's toys, scattered across the ground  |
|  6  | Children's drawings etched into trees, depicting people with expressions of terror and despair |
|  7  | A high pitched screech echoes through the trees for 1 minute.  Anyone who listens to it for the full duration must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving through or be subjected to a randomly chosen form of long term madness until they complete a long rest |
|  8  | A 1 mile in diameter cloud of dark fog blocking the way forward.  For every 5 minutes a creature spends in the fog, it must make a DC 15 Constitution save or take 1d4 necrotic damage and have its hit point maximum reduced by that much.
|  9  | An **oni** disguised as a lost traveler |
|  10 | A dark cabin with a stone well in its backyard |

##### Ghost Wood Encounters (Night)

## Modifications to Player Options
The following are rules modifications to player class features, background features, and spells that would otherwise trivialize much of the challenge of overland travel.  While the players will certainly gain access to powers as they level that will greatly reduce the burden of traversing large dangerous lands, the abilities are available to players at such a low level, that they have the potential to almost entirely remove the challenge of overland travel from the beginning of the game.  The following changes are meant to keep the abilities useful while preventing from nullifying travel challenges entirely.


### Class Features

##### Ranger Feature: Natural Explorer
You are particularly familiar with one type of natural
environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in
such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic,
coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, swamp,
or the Underdark. When you make an Intelligence or
Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your
proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that
you're proficient in.

While traveling for an hour or more in your favored
terrain, you gain the following benefits:

* Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group's travel.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to navigate the terrain
* Even when you are engaged in another activity while
traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking),
you remain alert to danger.
* If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at
a normal pace.
* When you forage, add a +5 to the result of your Wisdom (Survival) check.
* While tracking other creatures, you also learn their
exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they
passed through the area.

You choose additional favored terrain types at 6th
and 10th level.

> ##### What Changed?
> Rather than never becoming lost, Rangers just have advantage on their navigation checks, and rather than finding double rations when foraging, they essentially find an extra person's worth.

\pagebreakNum

### Background Features

##### Outlander Feature: Wanderer
You have an excellent memory for maps and geography, and you can always recall the general layout of terrain, settlements, and other features around you.  As a result, you are treated as always having a mental map of any area you've been before, giving yourself or an allied navigator advantage on checks to navigate such terrain.  Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to forage for food and water in wilderness environments.

### Spells

#### Create or Destroy Water
*1st level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V S M (a droplet of blessed water worth at least 1g if creating water which the spell consumes, or enchanted dust worth at least 1g if destroying water which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous

You either create or destroy water. 

**Create Water.** You create up to 10 gallons of clean water within range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as rain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in the area. 

**Destroy Water.** You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an open container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a 30-foot cube within range.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you create or destroy 10 additional gallons of water, or the size of the cube increases by 5 feet, for each slot level above 1st.

#### Create Food and Water
*3rd level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** : V S M (a pound of the food that you wish to replicate, a cup of water, and piece of silverware worth at least 5g all of which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
___
You replicate up to 45 pounds of nonmagical food and 30 gallons of nonmagical water on the ground or in containers within range, the magical food is enough to sustain up to fifteen humanoids or five steeds for 24 hours. The food spoils if uneaten after 8 hours and is no longer nourishing. The water is clean and doesn’t go bad.
k

#### Floating Disk
*1st level conjuration (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a drop of mercury and sliver disk worth 15 gp)
- **Duration:**  8 hours
___

This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The disk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk falls to the ground.
The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.
If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends. 

The spell also ends if you cast this spell again.

#### Goodberry
*1st level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (A sprig of mistletoe worth at least 1g, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
___

Up to 5 berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration. A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1d4 hit points, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one day.

The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 8 hours of the casting of this spell.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more berry for each slot above 1st.
