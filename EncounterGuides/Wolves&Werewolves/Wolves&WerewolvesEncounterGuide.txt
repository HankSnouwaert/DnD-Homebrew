## Wolves

Wolves are a classic, low-level enemy for fledgling adventurers to face in the wild. Dire wolves are larger and provide a greater challenge but operate in the same manner. Like most predatory beasts, players are likely to encounter wolves when they wander into a pack’s territory, a desperately hungry pack is hunting them, or the wolves are being used as war beasts by other humanoids. 

Regardless of the encounter’s circumstances, wolves rely on their numbers and pack tactics to overwhelm their foes. Wolves aren’t likely to attack humanoids unless they outnumber them or are starving. Dire wolves may be more brazen about attacking in smaller numbers due to their size advantage over humanoids. Still, even they aren’t likely to attack if their prey outnumbers them and appears in good condition. 

### Motivations

* Hunting for food
* Protecting territory
* Acting in service or protection of those it perceives as packmates
#### Ascendant Packleader
* Serve the sacred purpose of its creation

### Tactics

#### Engagement

With their Keen Sense, wolves are likely to detect potential prey before they themselves are noticed. The wolves will then attempt to stalk and stealthily approach their prey, closing in as close as possible before being seen. Once spotted, the wolves try to drive their prey into fleeing. They may use intimidation or run at a target in an attempt to spook it, but they prefer to stay out of striking distance of creatures standing their ground. 

#### Combat

If one or more creatures run, the wolves will chase after them unless isolated targets are left behind for the wolves to surround. If multiple creatures scatter, the wolves will close in on one target. Wolves will chase prey long distances, exhausting their victims before closing in for the kill. If a wolf can close the distance, it will attempt to use its trip attack, hampering the target’s ability to flee and giving other wolves a chance to close in from all sides.

If all the creatures stand their ground, they make themselves much less appealing prey to the wolves. The pack may attempt to isolate and surround one target if it looks like they can get a quick kill. If their prey poses a formidable threat to the wolves, they are unlikely to attack unless starving or under some supernatural influence. 

##### Ascendant Packleader

If an ascendant packleader leads the wolf pack, they will operate with a higher level of tactical complexity. They typically initiate combat with their Hunter’s Howl, which not only helps their allies close distance on prey but frightens the prey into running, setting up the chase scenario wolves prefer. They can then use their Bark Orders bonus action during combat to keep their pack mates in the action and focusing on high-priority targets.

If the wolves do engage in combat, they will usually be quick to flee if it appears the tide is turning against them. Any individual wolf is likely to flee once it loses 10 percent of its health unless it is desperately hungry, in which case it may fight until it has lost 50 to 60 percent of its health. If half or more of a wolf pack has fled and their opponents still appear to be in fighting condition, the remaining wolves will typically retreat. 

#### Retreat

Any individual wolf is likely to flee once it loses 10 percent of its health unless it is desperately hungry, in which case it may fight until it has lost 50 to 60 percent of its health. If half or more of a wolf pack has fled and their opponents still appear to be in fighting condition, the remaining wolves will typically retreat.

Wolves being led by an ascendant packleader will often fight to the death so long as their leader commands them. The packleader will usually call for a retreat if the pack is losing the fight unless doing so would violate their sacred duty. If the packleader is slain, the wolves may go mad and attempt to avenge its death or revert to acting like normal wolves and retreat.

## Werewolves

Werewolves are the most common and iconic of lycanthropes, and players might encounter them while traveling through lonely roads and settlements along wild frontiers. They usually dwell in areas where civilization is at odds with the wilds, though some werewolves trying to avoid harming humanoids may dwell in the deep wilderness, and some brazen werewolves may live in the heart of civilization. 

Sometimes players will face werewolves who have unwillingly transformed during a full moon. They will lack the tactical options of a werewolf who has mastered its curse but will still use the wolfish tactics that come naturally to them. Werewolves who have embraced their curse are far more dangerous, as they can pass for humanoids until the time comes for them to reveal their deadly nature.

### Motivations
* Hunting for food 
* Satisfying bloodlust
* Protecting territory
* Aiding packmates
* Ravaging civilization  

#### Moon Mystic
* Pursuit of primeval spiritualism

### Tactics

#### Engagement
Like wolves, werewolves prefer to stalk their prey, closing in as close as possible before their presence is known. When operating as a pack, they will surround their quarry to cut off as many avenues of escape as possible. If they can assume their humanoid forms, they may use deception to lure victims into isolated locations before shapeshifting and unleashing a surprise attack. However, this tactic doesn’t provide as much satisfaction as hunting in their bestial forms and is usually reserved for especially dangerous enemies. 

#### Combat


##### Pack Werewolves
Werewolves operating in a pack will fight much the same way as wolves. When spotted by foes, they will attempt to drive their enemies into fleeing so they can run them down. Once werewolves close in on their prey, they will focus on a target that appears most vulnerable and attempt to isolate and surround it so they can utilize their pack tactics. These targets are most often enemy spell casters or other soft targets who can cause a lot of trouble for the werewolves. If there are enough pack members, the werewolves may send some of their group to harass and distract other foes while they finish off their priority victims. Any enemy wielding a silvered weapon or capable of dealing thunder damage becomes a priority target for werewolves, and they will surround and kill such a foe as quickly as possible.

##### Packleaders

If a packleader is present, it will usually use its Hunters Howl to force its foes to flee and to help its pack close the distance. The packleader will also be the one to set high-priority targets for the pack, and its Dogpile trait enables the werewolves to take down these targets that much faster.

##### Lone Werewolves

Lone werewolves lack access to the group tactics of pack werewolves but will otherwise use the same general tactics of other werewolves. They may work with other types of creatures in combat but don’t rely on having allies present to be effective at taking down soft targets.

##### Moon Mystics

Moon mystics will generally stay out of melee combat and hurl lunar bolts at high-priority targets that might be staying out of reach of the rest of the pack. They will, in turn, utilize their pack to keep enemies from reaching them so they can better utilize their ranged attacks and avoid losing concentration on Searing Moonlight.

If the opportunity presents itself, it is most efficient for moon mystics to start combat with their Searing Moonlight so they can use their bonus action each subsequent turn to control it while making other attacks. If one or more enemies are tied up in melee combat with other werewolves, the mystic will drop its Searing Moonlight on those enemies to help whittle them down. They may also use their Searing Moonlight on casters hiding away from combat in an attempt to force them to lose concentration on any ongoing spells. The mystic’s Pale Hex trait means Searing Moonlight can also be used to hamper the ranged abilities of snipers.

#### Retreat
Despite their bloodthirsty natures, werewolves have a strong sense of self-preservation. Their ravenous natures will keep them fighting longer than wolves, though most werewolves will attempt to flee if they are reduced to less than half health or outnumbered by well-armed opponents. If a powerful figure such as a packleader or moon mystic commands the pack and is still in the fight, the other werewolves may continue fighting even if wounded or outnumbered. However, most werewolf leaders will attempt to withdraw their pack if they sense they are losing.

## Wagon Break Down
In this encounter, the players find themselves protecting a broken-down wagon under attack by desperate and opportunistic wolves. 

### Lead Up
The wagon is being pulled by a **draft horse** and piloted by a pair of traveling merchants (**nobles**) who are taking a seldom-used trade route through a dangerous frontier. They have likely brought the players along for added protection, but you may instead have the players stumble upon the wagon if they are traveling separately on foot. The region consists of snowy, forested foothills, and the wagon has lost a wheel, forcing the merchants to stop and unload it as they attempt repairs while the sun sets. 

It’s been an unusually harsh winter, and the food-deprived wolves in the area are becoming more aggressive in their hunt for food. The wolves spot the wagon, the attempt to sneak up on it from all sides. If one of the players spots them, their characters will have a moment to ready themselves. Otherwise, the wolves will sneak up until they appear at the locations shown on the encounter map, at which point they will rush in at the surprised travelers.

When this occurs, you can read the following description:

> ##### Encounter Start Description
> You see glowing eyes in the dark everywhere you look. Soon gleaming fangs and snarling faces appear as wolves close in around you from all sides. The merchants gasp and make for their wagon, shouting: “Drive them off! Protect our goods, and we’ll pay ya! Promise!” The horse lets out a panicked neigh as the wolves move in, looking for a vulnerable target.  

### Map Description
* **The Ground.** The clearing with the wagon is mostly open terrain, and the snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement. The area with the wagon is on a lower elevation than the surrounding edges of the map, which slopes down towards the center.
* **Trees.** The smaller or isolated trees provide half cover to any creatures behind them. The larger groups of trees provide three-quarters cover. 
* **Wagon.** The wagon blocks line of sight to creatures in it and provides three-quarters cover to creatures attacking from the outside in. It provides total cover for creatures on opposite sides of it.
* **Ledges.** The rocky ledges provide about a 10-foot drop from the outside towards the center.

### Encounter Tactics


The wolves will charge the wagon in an attempt to spook their newfound prey into running. If nobody runs they will attempt to gang up on any player who is apart from the rest of the group. If the players all stay grouped up in or around the wagon, a pair of wolves will close in on the panicked horse in an attempt to score an easy kill. If a player exits the wagon to intervene, other wolves will surround that player and attempt to bring them down with trip attacks and pack tactics.

Any wolf that is reduced to half its hit points or less will attempt to flee for its life. Once half the pack is dead or fleeing, the remainder will flee as well. 

#### The Merchants

The two merchants are each armed with daggers but will hide inside the wagon while they wait for the players to drive off the wolves. They will only attack wolves who threaten the wagon. If they see their horse come under attack, they will shout at the players to intervene.

If you wish to add a complication to combat, you can have one of the nobles hop onto the horse and release it from the wagon so he can make a break for safety. If it manages to ride off, the wolf pack will begin pursuing him and eventually catch up and kill him and his horse if the players don’t intervene.

#### The Horse

The horse is latched to the cart, which currently can’t be pulled. This leaves the horse unable to move from its location, so it will do nothing but use hoof attacks at any wolf that comes near. If the horse is released from the wagon, it will make a run for it, and the entire pack will chase after it, eventually catching and killing it.




### Aftermath
If the merchants and their horse survive the encounter, the grateful merchants will gift each player 10 gold pieces or 10gp worth of supplies from their wagon. If one of the merchants dies, the remaining merchant will be badly shaken and not offer the players any reward. If both merchants die, but the players manage to bring the wagon to its destination, their business partner will demand the wagon’s contents as compensation for the inconvenience of his associates’ deaths. If the horse dies, the players will receive no reward from the merchants, and they will likely have to abandon the wagon to walk the rest of the journey.
