# Werewolf Creature Guide
This document contains a collection of resources to help you run adventures heavily featuring werewolves. These resources are divided into Encounter Guides, Loot Guides, and Example Encounters. Encounter Guides will help you understand the mindset, motivations, and tactics of the creatures, so you have a better idea of how to play them. Loot Guides provide alternate ways to provide treasure found after defeating these enemies. Example Encounters will provide encounter scenarios involving these creatures and instructions on how to run them.

## Encounter Guides
These guides explore the motivations and tactics of specific creatures to help provide richer roleplaying experiences when using them. Motivations determine the priorities the creature has and what goals it is likely to form based on them. Tactics determine the means through which the creature is most likely to achieve those goals. Motivations and tactics apply when roleplaying wild beasts looking for their next meal, as well as major characters serving as antagonists for an entire campaign.

### Motivations

Understanding a creature's motivations will help you give it goals that may put it into direct conflict with the players. If players can decern that a creature has goals that aren't just "be an enemy for the players to defeat," it will breathe more life into the world and give the players a chance to make more informed decisions as to how to deal with the creature. 

This section of the guide will provide examples of common motivations for these types of creatures in general and specialized motivations for more unique creatures.


### Tactics

Understanding a creature's preferred tactics will help you form a strategy for how the creature will attempt to achieve its goals and guide you in making the most of the creature's abilities. Players who can recognize a creature's tactics will then have a chance to make note of them and attempt to adjust their own tactics accordingly.

This section of the guide will provide examples of how the creatures prefer to initiate combat, what tactics they use during combat, and what they will do if they are losing.

## Loot Guides

The DMG contains Individual Treasure tables listing the number of coins that can be dropped by creatures of different CRs. However, many creatures have no reason to carry coins or even have them within their vicinity. Other creatures may carry wealth in the form of items whose value isn't apparent at first glance. And sometimes, items are hidden away in nearby areas that are difficult to spot. How different CRs are split among the tables also results in creatures of wildly different power levels dropping the same amounts of wealth.

You can use these loot guides if you wish to provide your players with alternate sources of wealth when they slay monsters that don't carry money, let players use their skills to collect wealth, or just provide treasure that scales more closely with creature CR.

The guides provide rules for allowing players to loot valuable goods from their foes' corpses or the surrounding area after an encounter. This looting can be done using a skill check made by one of the players, with the type of check required dependent on the type of item the player wishes to collect and how the item is being collected. The more successful the check, the more goods the player is able to collect. 

> ##### What’s Alternate Loot Good For?
>Treasure other than coins, gems, and art objects can be used to provide forms of wealth that better fit the context of the current environment. Players with the right skill sets might also be able to use valuables they find this way to craft useful items. These could be handy mundane items or even magic items. Hide and bone could be crafted into weapons and armor, while potent plants or liquids could form the base for a potion.

## Werewolf Encounter Guide

Werewolves are the most common and iconic of lycanthropes, and players might encounter them while traveling through lonely roads and settlements along wild frontiers. They usually dwell in areas where civilization is at odds with the wilds, though some werewolves trying to avoid harming humanoids may dwell in the deep wilderness, and some brazen werewolves may live in the heart of civilization. 

Sometimes players will face werewolves who have unwillingly transformed during a full moon. They will lack the tactical options of a werewolf who has mastered its curse but will still use the wolfish tactics that come naturally to them. Werewolves who have embraced their curse are far more dangerous, as they can pass for humanoids until the time comes for them to reveal their deadly nature.

### Werewolf Motivations
Because lycanthropes retain the intelligence of humanoids, their motivations can be broad and complex. Still, a werewolf's nature will inevitably shape its motivations and goals. Werewolves feel an innate drive to hunt and kill, with their ire directed towards humanoids of their own species in particular. Those who embrace this nature may seek the destruction of all things civilized. Those who reject their curse will have goals focused on suppressing their nature.

#### General Werewolf Motivations
* Hunting for food 
* Satisfying bloodlust
* Protecting territory
* Aiding packmates
* Ravaging civilization 
* Hiding or suppressing curse

#### Moon Mystic Motivations
* Pursuit of primeval spiritualism

### Tactics
Werewolves instinctually utilize many of the same tactics as ordinary wolfs. However, their humanoid intelligence and shapeshifting abilities allow them to implement these tactics in much more sophisticated ways. The specifics of these tactics will depend greatly on the types of werewolves and how much control they have over their shapeshifting abilities.

#### Engagement
Like wolves, werewolves prefer to stalk their prey, closing in as close as possible before their presence is known. When operating as a pack, they will surround their quarry to cut off as many avenues of escape as possible. If they can assume their humanoid forms, they may use deception to lure victims into isolated locations before shapeshifting and unleashing a surprise attack. However, this tactic doesn’t provide as much satisfaction as hunting in their bestial forms and is usually reserved for especially dangerous enemies. 

\pagebreakNum

#### Combat

Werewolves are highly aggressive combatants that leverage regenerative abilities to survive what would otherwise be reckless head-on assaults. A werewolf that picks its prey is relentless in its hunt. Enemies wielding silver or thunder magic may be avoided or singled out by a werewolf, depending on whether it is looking for an easy kill or the slaughter of its enemies entirely. 

##### Combat: Pack Werewolves
Werewolves operating in a pack will fight much the same way as wolves. When spotted by foes, they will attempt to drive their enemies into fleeing so they can run them down. Once werewolves close in on their prey, they will focus on a target that appears most vulnerable and attempt to isolate and surround it so they can utilize their pack tactics. 

These targets are most often enemy spell casters or other soft targets who can cause a lot of trouble for the werewolves. If there are enough pack members, the werewolves may send some of their group to harass and distract other foes while they finish off their priority victims. Any enemy wielding a silvered weapon or capable of dealing thunder damage becomes a priority target for werewolves, and they will surround and kill such a foe as quickly as possible.


##### Combat: Packleaders
If a packleader is present, it will usually use its Hunters Howl to force its foes to flee and to help its pack close the distance. The packleader will also be the one to set high-priority targets for the pack, and its Dogpile trait enables the werewolves to take down these targets that much faster.

##### Combat: Lone Werewolves
Lone werewolves lack access to the group tactics of pack werewolves but will otherwise use the same general tactics of other werewolves. They may work with other types of creatures in combat but don’t rely on having allies present to be effective at taking down soft targets.

##### Combat: Moon Mystics
Moon mystics will generally stay out of melee combat and hurl lunar bolts at high-priority targets that might be staying out of reach of the rest of the pack. They will, in turn, utilize their pack to keep enemies from reaching them so they can better utilize their ranged attacks and avoid losing concentration on Searing Moonlight.

If the opportunity presents itself, it is most efficient for moon mystics to start combat with their Searing Moonlight so they can use their bonus action each subsequent turn to control it while making other attacks. If one or more enemies are tied up in melee combat with other werewolves, the mystic will use its Searing Moonlight on those enemies to help whittle them down since it won't damage other werewolves. They may also use their Searing Moonlight on casters hiding away from combat in an attempt to force them to lose concentration on any ongoing spells. The mystic’s Pale Hex trait means Searing Moonlight can also be used to hamper the ranged abilities of snipers.

\columnbreak

#### Retreat
Despite their bloodthirsty natures, werewolves have a strong sense of self-preservation. Their ravenous natures will keep them fighting longer than wolves, though most werewolves will attempt to flee if they are reduced to less than half health or outnumbered by well-armed opponents. If a powerful figure such as a packleader or moon mystic commands the pack and is still in the fight, the other werewolves may continue fighting even if wounded or outnumbered. However, most werewolf leaders will attempt to withdraw their pack if they sense they are losing.

The presence of silvered weapons or thunder magic amongst their enemies will make werewolves more likely to flee if they are unable to put a stop to the source of the damage. However, even foes without silver of thunder may be able to beat werewolves into submission. And, a werewolf is unlikely to continue fighting an enemy if it can't gain the upper hand, even if that enemy has no clear way to slay it outright.

## Werewolf Loot Guide
Because lycanthropes revert to their humanoid form when they are slain, most of the valuable items players can collect from them will be worn items or items dropped by their former victims. These valuables may include standard coinage. 

### Lootable Werewolf Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Werewolf Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Druidic Items |  Intelligence (Religion) |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.


##### Example Item Names
| GP <br> Value  | Moon Mystic Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  5sp  | Sylvan Charm | 
|  1gp |  Pale Totem |  
|  5gp | Lunar Idol |  
|  10gp| Moon Stone | 

\columnbreak

### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to harvest depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're harvesting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Lone & Pack Werewolf Loot Table

| Looting Check Result  |  Werewolf Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | Nothing | Nothing  |
|  6-12 | 1d4(2) gp worth of Coins/Items | 
|  13-16 | 3d6(10) gp worth of Coins/Items |  
|  17-20 | 6d6(20) gp worth of Coins/Items |  
|  21+ | 2d6 x 10(70) gp worth of Coins/Items |  

##### Pack Leader & Moon Mystic Loot Table

# Example Encounters



## Lycan Uprising <br> (Player Level: 12-14)
In this encounter, the players follow the trail of a rampaging werewolf to the wreckage of a village it recently demolished. Shortly after the players’ arrival, the mangled remains of the village’s former inhabitants violently begin transforming into werewolves. 

### Encounter Context
This encounter begins with the assumption that the players are on the trail of a monstrous werewolf. They have heard tales of a werewolf savaging the countryside or been assigned the task of hunting down the renegade werewolf directly. Under these circumstances, the players should have had an opportunity to arm themselves properly for their hunt before this encounter.

If you wish to truly put your players on the back foot, you can instead have them stumble upon the town with no for warning of what has happened or what they’re about to face. This will increase the odds of them needing to retreat if they have no means of slaying the werewolves.

### Lead Up

The werewolf’s trail leads the players to the burning wreckage of a small hamlet it has recently decimated. It is after dark in the dead of winter, and the only illumination is provided by the burning wreckage, which illuminates mangled and motionless bodies strewn across the ground.

The werewolf markers on the encounter map indicate which bodies aren’t truly dead but instead infected with lycanthropy. If the players attempt to inspect such a body before entering the town square, it will spring to life with a snarl and flee toward the center of town as it transforms into its hybrid form.

Once the players enter the town center or engage in combat with a werewolf they’ve managed to keep from fleeing, all of the werewolves will begin awakening.


When this occurs, you can read the following description:

> ##### Encounter Start Description
> A how pierces through the night, quickly followed by a chorus of tortured growling and snarling. You see several of the villagers’ bodies violently spasming as their lycanthropy overcomes them. The werewolves spring to action and waste no time in charging after you as the commanding howls of their new leader continue to echo through the village.

* **W:** Villager Body Ready to Turn into a Pack Werewolf
* **L:** Werewolf Pack Leader

<br> 

### Map Description
* **The Ground.** The ground outside is open terrain. The snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement, and there are no significant slopes

* **Buildings.** The buildings are made from light wood walls and thatch roofs. A creature can smash a Small hole through a wall with a DC 10 Strength check and a Medium hole with a DC 15 Strength check. Werewolves can automatically smash Medium holes through walls as an action. The rubble within the buildings is considered rough terrain, and any creature that moves within the fires for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there will automatically take 1d4 fire damage.

* **Trees.** The trees around the town have relatively thick bases and provide three-quarters cover to any creatures behind them. They can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Fountain.** The fountain in the center of town stands 15 feet high and can provide total cover to creatures that are Medium or smaller.

### Encounter Tactics

This fight combines the reckless brutality of freshly formed werewolves with the tactical guidance of an experienced pack hunter.

#### The New Werewolves

The werewolves that come to life possess a near-mindless bloodlust but still follow the orders of their pack leader. They will immediately try to surround the most vulnerable-looking party member to utilize trip attacks and pack tactics. Because they must use half their movement standing up, werewolves from the further edges of town likely won’t reach players within the first round. This will give the players a chance to position themselves to avoid being surrounded.

#### The Pack Leader

The pack leader is more cunning and levelheaded than the freshly transformed werewolves. Its goal is to leverage the element of surprise so it can slaughter the players in an ambush and thus be rid of its pursuers. If this new pack of werewolves survives, so much the better. But, the pack leader has little attachment to them beyond their immediate usefulness.

The pack leader will burst through the window of its hiding spot and join the fray as soon as it detects that its pack is closing in on the players. It will utilize its Dog Pile ability to help its pack neutralize any dangerous spell casters as quickly as possible. If the players have positioned themselves in a way to gain the upper hand, the pack leader can use its Hunter’s Howl to scramble their positions while allowing its pack to catch up to preferred targets.

#### Retreat
NEED TO ADD



### Aftermath
If the players flee the cultists, they will eventually come for the town and attempt to spread lycanthropy to as many citizens as possible.

If the players manage to slay the moon mystic and his cultists, they will be able to investigate the objects occupying the altar and potentially put a stop to lunar madness affecting the town. How easily they can put a stop to the madness will depend on whether you want to link this event to further adventures. 

If you want this to be a one-off encounter, the priest-turned-moon-mystic may have been the source of the madness all along, in which case, the altar may contain the clues necessary to stop the curse of madness affecting the town. 

If you wish this to be a part of a larger adventure, the priest going mad may have just been a symptom of a larger problem, in which case the altar may contain clues pointing to the root cause of the madness.

\columnbreak


#### XP Award: 8,800xp
The degree of success they had in defeating the pack leader can affect the XP players receive. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The pack leader and all werewolves are slain, ending lycanthropic threat for good
* **100% XP:** The pack leader is slain, but several werewolves manage to escape, risking the further spread of lycanthropy across the land
* **50% XP:** The players drive off the werewolves, but the pack leader escapes
* **10% XP:** The players are forced to retreat



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficult accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Stagger the pace at which the villagers are revived as werewolves, so only 2 attack at first along with the pack leader. Have a new werewolf revive and enter the battle at the beginning of each subsequent round. Change the XP Award to 4,800.

**Harder Encounter.** Have a new werewolf revive in a random location at the beginning of each round for the next 5 rounds after the encounter starts. Change the XP Award to 10,000.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The pack leader serves a more powerful master who tasked it with raising a werewolf army for future conquest. |
|  2  | The pack master is acting in service of a vindictive nature spirit who wishes to drive all forms of civilization from its wilderness home, even if that means transforming all the humanoid inhabitants into vicious lycanthropes. |
|  3  | The pack leader fled from a group of vampire nobles who use werewolves as slave warriors. Its goal was to raise a rebel army of lycanthropes to overthrow its former masters. |
|  4  | The pack leader has a dark form of lycanthropy, keeping it trapped in its hybrid form at all times. Those it infects are inflicted with the same curse and stuck as bloodthirsty savages at all times. If this curse isn’t stamped out, the entire countryside could soon be overrun with hordes of marauding werewolves.|

\pagebreakNum

## Lunatic Moon <br> (Player Level: 9-11)
In this encounter, the players come across of group of unhinged moon worshippers performing a lunar ritual to transform themselves into werewolves, with the group’s leader becoming a werewolf moon mystic.

### Encounter Context
This encounter begins with the players coming across the lunatic cultists performing a primeval ritual underneath the full moon. The cultists are from a nearby town that has been suffering from waves of madness sweeping across its population in tandem with the lunar cycles. The town’s priest, who in his madness has forsaken his former god, now leads a small cult of deranged moon worshippers seeking to escape their weak human bodies. 

The players may have visited the town before the encounter and learned about a strange group of unhinged individuals who regularly sneak into the woods. One of the remaining sane townsfolk may have even asked the players for help in finding a way to end the madness.

### Lead Up

The town priest is performing a lunar ritual in the woods surrounded by his most fearsome devotees (thugs) who are on lookout and guard duty. Regardless of whether the players are spotted when they approach, the ritual begins taking effect by the time they arrive, transforming the priest into a moon mystic. If the players are hidden but wait longer than a minute to make their move, they will witness the other cultists begin turning into werewolves one by one. 

If the players are spotted or begin to attack, you can read the following description:


> ##### Encounter Start Description
> The former priest lets loose an unholy howl that threatens to overwhelm your sanity. His cultists respond with a wolf-like battle cry as they move to attack. You notice an unnatural gleam in their eyes as their once-human features begin to twist into a wolfish visage.

### Map Description
* **The Ground.** The ground outside is open terrain. The snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement, and there are no significant slopes
* **Trees.** The smaller or isolated trees provide half cover to any creatures behind them. The larger groups of trees provide three-quarters cover. 
* **Trees and Bushes.** The bushes are very dense, and moving 5 feet through them costs 15 feet of movement. The lone trees provide three-quarters cover, and the tree clusters provide full cover.

##### Map Legend
* **P:** Player Arrival Location
* **M:** Moon Mystic
* **T:** Cult Member (**thug**)

<br>

* **Ritual Altar.** A large wooden stump serves as the altar for the lupine ritual. Now that the ritual has been completed, the green crystal ball and other occult objects atop it no longer serve any active purpose.


### Encounter Tactics

At the end of each round of combat, the moon mystic will choose a cultist to have transformed into a pack werewolf. This transformation causes it to regain all its health and be cured of any ailments it is suffering from that it could normally make a saving throw against at the start or end of its turn. If the moon mystic is slain, the ritual ends, and there are no further transformations.

#### The Moon Mystic

The moon mystic will begin the fight by using its Searing Moonlight to begin whittling down the players that appear to be the highest threat. These targets will likely be players able to do high damage from a distance. He then focuses on utilizing his lunar bolts to either neutralize more fragile players who rely on ranged attacks or to give his minions advantage on attacks against players they are focusing on. While the moon mystic still has lunar bolts available, he will keep his minions between himself and melee-focused players and utilize the trees as cover from ranged attacks. He will only pursue melee combat once he no longer has ranged attacks available.

#### Cultist Thugs/Werewolves

The thugs will open combat with heavy crossbow fire if they have a clear shot and the players are still at a distance. They will continue with this strategy until the players demonstrate clear ranged superiority, the players close the gap, or the majority of them have turned into werewolves.

When the werewolves or the thugs engage in melee combat, they will move in groups of at least two to utilize their Pack Tactics and try to gang up on single targets as much as possible. Thugs who are low health or at risk of getting hit by the moon mystic’s Searing Moonlight will be priority choices for werewolf transformation at the end of each round. 

The thugs and werewolves will also do what they can to stop players who are posing the highest direct threat to the moon mystic. That may be focusing their damage on a soft target to bring them down quickly or using trip attacks on a melee-focused player to make it difficult for them to reach the mystic.



### Aftermath
If the moon mystic survives, he will continue his quest to convert the mad town to lycanthropy. If he is stopped, whether the madness afflicting the town ends or not depends on what you want the scope of this plot to be. If you wish this to be a one-off encounter, the mad priest may have been the source of the madness all along, having turned to the worship of an insane lunar deity who brought about this insanity. Otherwise, the priest may have been a symptom of the madness rather than the cause. In this case, the players will need to investigate further to get to the bottom of the town’s lunar curse.

The crystal ball on the altar was used as a focus for the ritual but is no longer tied to the curse, and it is essentially an art object worth 500 gp at this point.



#### XP Award:4,800xp
The degree of success they had in defeating the cultists can affect the XP the players receive. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **100% XP:** The moon mystic and all the cultists were neutralized
* **50% XP:** The cultists were neutralized, but the moon mystic escaped
* **10% XP:** The players retreated with the moon mystic and the majority of the cultists still alive 

\columnbreak

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficult accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Reduce the number of thugs to 3. Change the XP Award to 3,600.

**Harder Encounter.** Have the thugs transform into pack werewolves two at a time. Change the XP Award to 8,000.   

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

|  2  | The priest’s ritual has resulted in permanent nightfall over the village with the full moon overhead. The players must find the components for a corresponding sun ritual to restore the day and cure the town of its insanity. |
|  3  | Though the curse appears to have been lifted from the town, the players become plagued by demented nightmares. Each time they have these nightmares, people nearby seem to be mentally affected by them. |
|  4  | The disruption to the ritual has driven the majority of the village into a murderous frenzy. The remaining sane inhabitants beg the players to help them escape as the remaining inhabitants devolve into twisted monsters. |

## Howling Madness <br> (Player Level:6-8)
In this encounter, the players find themselves being hunted by an ascendant packleader who has been corrupted by an eldritch artifact hidden in the woods.

### Encounter Context
The encounter focuses on an eldritch artifact hidden away deep in the woods, which has driven the ascendant packleader who dwells there mad. The packleader now leads its pack of wolves through these twisted wilds, hunting and killing everything in sight.
The players will know something is corrupting the wilds and may have heard tales of a monstrous wolf leading its pack on a murderous rampage. They should not know that the corruption is being caused by the artifact. 

If you wish this to be part of a larger adventure, you could have the players face more kinds of twisted woodland monsters as they try to find the source of the corruption. The packleader may even be hunting them as they travel, and the artifact revives it at its location each time it is defeated.

### Lead Up

As the players approach the artifact’s location, the packleader will close in to protect the source of the corruption. The artifact will sense when the player’s approach, regardless of how stealthy they are, and will summon the packleader to its defense. 

When the players approach from the bottom edge of the battle map, the packleader will close in with its pack and attempt to stealthily encircle the players. This will include a pair of wolves attempting to sneak around and move in from behind. The tokens on the map show the general areas they will attempt to approach from. Once one or more are spotted or are within striking distance, they will all attack.


When this occurs, you can read the following description:

> ##### Encounter Start Description
> Emerging from the forest around you, multiple wolves close in from all directions. Leading the pack is an unnaturally large wolf that seems to be made of writhing shadows with a pair of eyes giving off a maddening green glow. Through the trees, you can see something else is also giving off a faint green glow.

### Map Description
* **The Ground.** The ground outside is open terrain. The snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement, and there are no significant slopes
* **Trees.** The smaller or isolated trees provide half cover to any creatures behind them. The larger groups of trees provide three-quarters cover. 
* **Trees and Bushes.** The bushes are very dense, and moving 5 feet through them costs 15 feet of movement. The lone trees provide three-quarters cover, and the tree clusters provide full cover.

### Encounter Tactics


The packleader and its wolves will make preventing the players from reaching the artifact their priority. Any player that approaches it will be swarmed by as many available wolves as possible.

The packleader can use its Bark Order to facilitate moving wolves out of losing fights and help them surround and neutralize fragile or troublesome players. But, most of all, it uses it to help wolves catch up and close in on any creature approaching the artifact. If the entire party is closing in on the artifact, it will use its Hunter’s Howl to attempt to drive them away and have its wolves give chase.


#### The Artifact

The item responsible for this madness looks like a crystal ball radiating an unnatural greenish light. Any creature, other than the packmaster or its wolves, that comes within 10 feet of it for the first time on its turn or ends its turn within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be subjected to the *confusion* spell until the end of its next turn.

The artifact has 50 HP, an AC 15, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If it is destroyed, the green glow will vanish from the eyes of the packleader, who will then cease attacking the players and attempt to flee, taking its wolves with it.

#### Retreat
So long as the artifact remains intact, the packleader will fight to the death. The wolves will fight on as long as the packleader remains in the fight. If it flees, the wolves will flee with it. If it dies, any wolf that doesn’t outnumber its immediate foes or is below half its hit points will flee.

### Aftermath
If the players destroy the artifact, the curse of madness on the woods will end. A golden stand on which the artifact was sitting is carved with intricate and disturbing eldritch patterns but is not magical and will fetch about 100gp on the open market. 

If the packleader is cleared of corruption and survives, it will leave a parting gift in the players’ path as they leave the woods. The players will find a wooded flute with a wolf’s head carved at the end. A player that picks it up will instantly know how it works. Anyone who uses an action to play it will cause it to emit a wolf’s howl, which summons 4 wolves as though summoned by the *conjure animals* spell. Once the flute is used this way, it loses all its magical properties, which the players should be aware of when they receive it. 



#### XP Award: 3,000xp
The degree of success they had in ending the source of the madness can affect the XP the players receive. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The artifact was destroyed, and the packleader survived
* **100% XP:** The artifact and the packleader were both destroyed
* **50% XP:** The packleader was destroyed, but the players failed to locate or destroy the artifact
* **10% XP:** The players didn’t destroy the packleader of the artifact
