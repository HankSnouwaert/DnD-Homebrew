# Two-Creature Weapons Teams
Some weapons are so massive they require two creatures to move and operate them effectively. These weapons may be oversized firearms, large incendiary devices, or unwieldy melee weapons such as large drills. Though they come in many forms, they have a few common traits: they require two creatures to operate, they can be moved without hindrance by two creatures, and they must be loaded with some form of fuel and ammunition on a regular basis to be fired.

## Two-Creature Weapon Rules
Two-creature weapons require at least two creatures to operate them, and they come with the following additional rules considerations:


### The Weapons Team
The two creatures operating a two-creature weapon are known as the weapons team. The weapons team consists of a leader and a follower. Only one creature can be assigned to each role, and they cannot switch roles once assigned, even if one of the roles becomes vacant, unless they leave the weapons team and rejoin.

#### Joining a Weapons Team

Joining a two-creature weapons team costs a creature's action and half of its movement as it equips its part of the weapon. If one creature is already part of the weapons team, it may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature joining the team. Leaving a weapon team requires no action as the creature drops its part of the weapon.

A creature must have both hands available to be on a weapons team and can't pick anything else up without dropping its part of the weapon.

The creatures within a weapons team must stay within 5 feet of each other and the weapon at all times. If one of them is ever more than 5 feet away from the weapon or the other team member, it is no longer part of the team. 

#### Moving Two-Creature Weapons
The follower can no longer move on its turn except to leave the weapons team. The leader's speed becomes equal to the lowest speed among the creatures on the weapons team. Whenever the leader moves, it can choose to move the follower along with it if the follower is willing, even when the leader is moved against its will. 

#### Stealth
While part of a weapons team, a creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, activating a two-creature weapon reveals the weapons team's location if they are hidden.



### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

## Two-Creature <br> Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, <br> weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these <br> weapons have the following additional <br> attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored <br> through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, <br> the weapon becomes inoperative and <br> irreparably damaged.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature <br> needs to make a check for fixing mishaps, <br> when a creature is repairing the weapon, <br> or the weapon forces a creature to make  a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning two-creature weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Actions station
By default, weapons can have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by creatures on their weapons teams. The Load and Crank functions can be activated by the follower, and the Fire function can be activated by the leader. Each function can only be activated once per round. 

#### Load
This function is used by the follower to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the follower to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition, and creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits the follower this way, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Crank
Not all weapons have this function. If a weapon does, it must be activated by the follower before each use of the Fire function to move the ammo or fuel through the weapon.

#### Fire
The function is activated by the leader to fire the weapon. When this function is activated, but before its effect occurs, roll to see if a Mishap occurs.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 If a Mishap occurs, its effects happen before the effects of the Fire. This function can't be used if the weapon is out of ammo or if the weapon has a Crank function that hasn't been used since the weapon was last loaded or fired.

### Mishaps
Mishaps represent the weapon experiencing a significant malfunction. There is always a risk of this when firing the weapon, and some weapons have other circumstances that risk a mishap. Whenever this risk occurs, roll a d6. On a result of 1, a Mishap occurs, and the creature who triggered it must roll on the weapon's Mishap Table to determine the nature of this malfunction (see the Mishap Table section).

If the weapon has less than half its hit points, roll 2d6 and take the lowest result when checking for a mishap. 

Unless stated otherwise, you must always check for a mishap when activating the Fire function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Most weapons have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways their functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishap Table.

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Ratfolk Two-Creature Weapons
Though two-creature weapons teams are deployed by many races with the technological know-how to craft such weapons, ratfolk are among the most prolific users of such weaponry. This may be due to the combination of their technical capabilities, their willingness to take on the risks such weapons pose, and the seemingly never-ending amount of weapons designs their mad engineers concoct. Though these weapons can be hazardous to their users, ratfolk are never shy about accepting such risks if it means getting the opportunity to obliterate foes with overwhelming firepower. 

The ever-opportunistic ratfolk often mass-produce their most popular designs and sell their inventions to the highest bidder. They will often make more potent versions of these weapons as well. These masterwork variations gain sinister nicknames as their dreaded reputation builds, and they are reserved for use by the most prestigious clients of the ratfolk engineers.


### Poisoned Wind Mortars
This fiendish artillery piece is an amalgamation of primitive engineering and unholy alchemy, a stark representation of the Ratfolk's cunning adaptability. Crudely crafted from rusting iron and scavenged metals, its appearance belies the terror it inflicts. It's not merely the brutish launch mechanism of a traditional mortar that warrants fear, but the horrific payload it delivers.

At the heart of this weapon lies the Poisoned Wind - a deadly concoction of the most lethal substances the Ratfolk have extracted from their underworld environment, or synthesized through their arcane and toxic alchemy. Sealed within fragile orbs of glass, this gas waits with malevolent potential for release.

When the Poisoned Wind Mortar fires, these spheres arc high through the air, shattering on impact and spreading their malignant payload: a green, ethereal miasma that sickens, corrodes, and eventually kills those who inhale it. Armor tarnishes and rots, flesh sears and boils, and the very life-force is choked out of those caught within the cloud. The sight of this deathly fog approaching not only brings physical destruction but also instills terror, often breaking the morale of the enemy before the cloud even reaches them.

#### Poisoned Wind Mortar Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a Poisoned Wind Mortar. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Acid Blast.** When the weapon's ammo shatter at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the weapon's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (The orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

**Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the weapon's ammo deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

**Warp Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the weapon's ammo, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

#### Poisoned Wind Mortar Tactics
Poisoned wind mortars function as artillery and excel in providing area denial and obscuring the enemies' vision. This tactic proves highly effective when ratfolk forces need to reposition, surprise their enemies, blind opposing ranged attackers, or force them to move. Due to the delicate nature of their ammunition, Poisoned Wind Mortar teams will use their Scurry Away feature to quickly escape whenever an enemy approaches melee range. 

The upgrades for poisoned wind mortars don't alter their tactics but instead enhance their effectiveness in their existing roles.

### Ratling Guns
A paradoxical fusion of crude engineering and subtle brilliance, the Ratling Gun is a testament to the ratfolk's knack for invention. Built from scavenged metals, timeworn wood, and the odd mysterious alloys they mine from the depths, this rapid-fire weapon is a sight to behold. It is composed of multiple rotating barrels, each capable of spitting out a hail of deadly ammunition at a terrifying rate.

The ammunition is unique to the ratfolk, handcrafted in the underbelly of their world. A mixture of sharp metal shards, stolen and scavenged munitions, and occasional nuggets of strange underworld minerals, all are melted down and recast into thousands of wicked, serrated projectiles.

When activated, the Ratling Gun roars to life, its barrels spinning in a lethal whirl. In seconds, it can transform a tranquil landscape into a storm of flying metal, shredding through ranks of foes like a scythe through wheat. The very sight and sound of the Ratling Gun is enough to break the morale of many a foe, a rapid, deafening symbol of the ratfolk's ferocity.


Yet, the Ratling Gun is not without its flaws. It is a volatile and unpredictable weapon. Overheating is common, leading to disastrous explosions that harm friend and foe alike. The ammunition, while plentiful, is inconsistent, causing unpredictable trajectories and often requiring a significant volume of fire to be effective.

#### Ratling Gun Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a ratling gun. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Ratling Coolant.** When rolling to check for a mishap with the weapon, you can choose to disregard one of the d6s you roll (if you're only rolling 1d6, you can negate the need to roll.) If the weapon incurs damage that reduces its hit points to half or less, or if a mishap occurs, the coolant bursts. The burst coolant forces each creature within a 10-foot radius of the weapon to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, suffering 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. The coolant burst is resolved prior to any Mishaps that triggered this event. Oncet the coolant bursts, the weapon loses this ability until it fully regains its hit points.

**Rot Shots.** Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire function, it sustains a wound. At the end of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage per wound. A creature can have multiple wounds simultaneously. Wounds can be healed if the creature regains 10 or more hit points, or if a use of a healer's kit is expended on it. Alternatively, the wounded creature or another creature within 5 feet can make a DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action, ending all wounds on a success.

**On-Board Ammo Assembler.** When the follower is using the weapon's Load function, they can choose to salvage parts from an unmanned two-creature weapon or vehicle with a CR of 3 or higher within 5 feet, provided it has at least 30 hit points. Doing so inflicts 30 damage to the salvaged weapon or vehicle. If this reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is dismantled and cannot be used for further salvaging. The follower gains a special ammo belt made from the salvaged parts that lasts for one minute. While using this ammo, the weapon deals an additional 13 (2d12) damage with its Fire function, but the function triggers a Mishap on a roll of 1 or 2 when using this ammo.

\columnbreak

#### Ratling Gun Tactics
The ratling gun represents the epitome of risk-reward weaponry, with its potential to eliminate virtually any target, be it swarms of enemies or a single formidable creature. Its primary targets are foes with heavy armor and low dexterity.

As long as the fight is progressing favorably, weapons teams typically start by firing two rounds per turn. However, when victory is within grasp or defeat is imminent, the rate of fire escalates. In extreme panic or power-driven frenzy, teams fire as many rounds as possible.

##### Ratling Gun Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Ratling Coolant.** This safety upgrade gives weapons teams the confidence to fire three shots per turn instead of the usual two, as long as the coolant is active.

**Rot Shots.** With this upgrade, the team is more likely to distribute their shots across multiple targets to inflict bleeding. If there's a creature effectively healing the wounds, they will focus their fire on that target, often risking more rounds per turn to eliminate it.

**On-Board Ammo Assembler.** Encounters involving multiple ratling guns with this upgrade can be interesting. The guns are encouraged to be more reckless, firing more shots per turn. If one of the guns experiences a malfunction, the team abandons it, and the remaining ratling gun teams cannibalize its parts. The increased mishap rate from the newly acquired scrap bullets means they can deliver devastating damage but with higher misfire risks. When the weapons misfire and become disabled, they contribute more scrap for the remaining ratling guns.

### Warpfire Throwers

Constructed from rusted metal, corroded pipes, and bizarrely vibrant crystals mined from the deep earth, the Warpfire Thrower is as terrifying as it is crude. It is a deceptively simple device, consisting of a large, cumbersome tank filled with a mysterious, volatile substance, connected to a projecting nozzle manipulated by its ratfolk wielder.

This enigmatic liquid, known only as "Warpfire", is a product of the ratfolk's arcane knowledge and alchemical prowess. Glowing with an eerie, otherworldly light, it is said to be the physical manifestation of raw, chaotic energy harnessed and condensed. When unleashed, the Warpfire clings to anything it touches, searing and consuming it with unnatural, green flames.

When the Warpfire Thrower is fired, a torrent of this deadly Warpfire is expelled, engulfing everything in its path. The very air seems to warp and ripple around it, and the heat it generates is so intense it can melt through steel and stone alike. The sight of this horrifying green firestorm is often enough to break the will of even the most hardened warriors.

However, the Warpfire Thrower is a perilous weapon, even to its handlers. The Warpfire is highly volatile and unpredictable, and any misstep, any fault in the device, can result in catastrophic backlashes. It's not uncommon for the thrower to explode in a ball of Warpfire, consuming the ratfolk operator and those unfortunate enough to be nearby.

#### Warpfire Thrower Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a Poisoned Wind Mortar. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Self-Destruct Mechanism.** The team follower may use their bonus action to activate the weapon's self-destruction sequence. At the end of that creature's next turn, the weapon is destroyed in an explosion, and every creature within 30 feet of it is subjected to the weapon's Fire function.

**Motorized Pumps.** Each time the warpfire thrower is cranked, it gains a level of heat that lasts until the weapon goes one full round without being cranked. If the safety protocol is overridden, the warpfire thrower gains two levels of heat. The warpfire thrower's Fire function deals an additional 4 (1d8) fire damage for each level of heat, and when checking for a mishap, a mishap occurs if the number rolled on a d6 is equal to or less than the current heat level.

**Warp Napalm.** If a creature or a flammable object fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire function, it ignites. Until an action is taken to douse the fire, the target suffers 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

\columnbreak

#### Warpfire Thrower Tactics
Warpfire throwers are designed to target the largest clustered group of enemies during a battle, but they always maintain a safe distance of at least 5 feet from any opponents. The weapons team will override its safety protocol whenever doing so allows them to hit two or more additional enemies. This strategy is also employed in moments of panic or when the team feels they have the upper hand.

##### Warpfire Thrower Upgrade Tactics
**Self-Destruct Mechanism.** This upgrade perfectly aligns with ratfolk tactics. Whenever the situation becomes even slightly precarious, the team will activate the self-destruct mechanism and immediately abandon their post to avoid the ensuing explosion.

**Motorized Pumps.**  As the heat builds up and becomes unstoppable, the weapon becomes incredibly dangerous. Consequently, the ratfolk operating this weapon tend to be more reckless than other teams.

**Warp Napalm.** his weapon is best suited for a hit-and-run strategy. Ratfolk are more likely to utilize their Scurry Away feature with this weapon, forcing creatures that have failed their saving throws to decide between extinguishing the flames or using their Dash actions to chase after the weapons team. The team should prioritize setting as many creatures ablaze as possible rather than focusing on one particular group.

### Warp Grinders
Fashioned from an eerie blend of scavenged metals, ancient stone, and uncanny, glowing crystals found only in the deepest crevices of the underworld, the Warp Grinder stands as a testament to the ratfolk's dark intellect. It consists of a pair of interlocked, spiral-shaped drills, powered by the raw, volatile energy housed within the strange crystals.

These drills, when activated, spin at tremendous speed, tearing through rock, metal, and even magic-enhanced barriers with alarming ease. They produce a chilling, grinding noise that haunts the tunnels, a sound as unnerving as the sight of the green, flickering energy that arcs around the device's tips. When put into overdrive, the device is capable of tearing apart huge swaths of earth and foes alike with the thunderous roar of its whirring drill.

The Warp Grinder's primary function is that of an unhindered excavator. With its pair of interlocked, spiraling drills spinning at astonishing speed, the device can burrow through the toughest of materials with ease. This ability is exploited by the ratfolk to quickly create new tunnels and pathways in the underground labyrinth they call home. Using the Warp Grinder, they can swiftly approach their unsuspecting enemies from unexpected directions, launching devastating ambushes that often turn the tide of battle in their favor.

In the realm of siege warfare, the Warp Grinder is equally menacing. It can quickly undermine defensive walls, chew through gatehouses, and reduce towers to rubble, making short work of even the most formidable fortifications. When faced with a barrier, whether physical or magical, the ratfolk operators merely rev up the Warp Grinder and let it do its terrifying work. In a matter of moments, once impregnable defenses crumble, sowing chaos among the defenders and paving the way for the ratfolk's vicious onslaught.

#### Warp Grinder Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warp grinder. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.


**Seismic Snare.** When a creature fails the saving throw against the weapon's Fire function and is standing on earth or stone, it becomes buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature is restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a Strength check against the weapon's DC. This check has advantage if the creature making it has a burrow speed.

**Emboldening Fumes.** When the Fire function is used, each creature that is part of the weapons team gains 10 temporary hit points at the end of the turn. While a creature has these temporary hit points, it is poisoned and immune to being frightened or charmed. A creature immune to the poisoned condition cannot gain these temporary hit points. If the weapon's safety protocol has been overridden, the team gains 20 temporary hit points instead. If the weapon has a Mishap, they gain 30 temporary hit points instead.

**Warp-Quake.** Whenever a creature fails its saving throw against the weapon's Fire function while standing on difficult terrain created by any warp-grinder within the last minute, it takes an extra 13(2d12) plus 9(2d8) thunder damage.


#### Warp Grinder Tactics

The warp grinder weapons teams expertly lead ratfolk in subterranean ambushes and serve as formidable shock troopers.

The warp grinder should be part of preplanned ambush teams, bursting from the ground to surprise enemies. However, the emergence point might be slightly random due to the difficulty of pinpoint precision during emergence. Note that the tunnels may require Medium creatures to squeeze through for traversal, except for ratfolk, who can easily navigate them with their Crevice Crawler feature.


\columnbreak

To determine if the warp grinder surprises enemies, have the weapons team carrying it perform Stealth checks. The team should override the safety protocol to move at maximum speed just before reaching the surface, preventing enemies from preparing for battle if they notice the incoming attack.

Upon surfacing, the team targets the nearest high-armor and low-dexterity enemy with the weapons Fire ability. If they can hit multiple targets without causing too much harm to friendly forces, they will override the safety protocol and use the area-of-effect version of the Fire ability. This will provide advantage to attacking allies if the targets are knocked prone. The difficult terrain created by this ability can also facilitate escape or hinder enemy reinforcements.

The burrowing ability remains useful even after surfacing. It allows the weapons team to move through the difficult terrain they create, avoid movement penalties, dig underground to dodge ranged attacks, and escape against Medium-sized creatures more easily.

##### Warp Grinder Upgrade Tactics
**Seismic Snare.** This upgrade enhances the warp grinder's debuffing capability, making it an excellent choice when teaming up with groups of ratfolk.

**Emboldening Fumes.** This upgrade empowers the warp grinder to be far more daring. Those affected by the fumes will never flee from battle.

**Warp-Quake.** This upgrade turns the team into masters of area denial. The safety protocol should be overridden whenever this feature is used. If there are no targets on difficult terrain, the team should spend its turn spreading as much difficult terrain as possible.

### Warplock Jezzails
Crafted from a crude amalgamation of scavenged metal, timeworn wood, and luminescent crystals of chaotic energy mined from the deepest corners of the underworld, the Warplock Jezzail is a weapon of chilling potency. It is an exceptionally long, large-bore firearm, reinforced with metal bands and an elaborate shielding mechanism for the operator.

The ammunition it fires is nothing short of terrifying. Each bullet is a small shard of the same eerie crystal that powers the Warplock Jezzail, carrying a piece of raw, volatile energy within. When fired, these bullets blaze a path through the air, leaving an eerie, glowing trail before they impact with devastating force, capable of penetrating the thickest armor.

With its range and power, the Warplock Jezzail is an unmatched weapon of assassination and long-range warfare. The ratfolk snipers, perched high atop their subterranean cliffs or hidden in the labyrinthine tunnels, can lay low powerful adversaries from an immense distance, their presence often only revealed by the greenish streak of a successful kill.

However, the Warplock Jezzail is as dangerous to its operator as it is to its targets. The raw energy within the ammunition and the firearm itself is volatile and unstable. A jammed bullet, a malfunctioning firing mechanism, or simply overuse can lead to disastrous explosions, often fatally wounding the wielder and those around them.

#### Warplock Jezzail Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a Warplock Jezzail. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Rat-Eye Scopes.** At the end of the team leader's turn, if they have not moved, they can choose to take aim at a creature within 400 feet that they can see. The leader maintains its aim at the target until the leader moves, or the leader can no longer see the target, or the target moves more than 400 feet away from the team leader. While the leader maintains this aim, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against the weapon's Fire function.

**Sniper Jezzail.** A creature doesn't have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while part of the weapons team, and creatures on the weapons team can traverse or halt in a space large enough to accommodate an object one size smaller than themselves without squeezing. Additionally, using the weapon doesn't reveal the weapons team's position to other creatures they are more than 30 feet away from.

**Embedding Rounds.** When a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire ability, the bullet embeds in the target for one minute. While embedded, the creature cannot regain hit points, and at the end of each of its turns, it takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage. The target creature or another creature within 5 feet can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check, attempting to extract the bullet. The target creature has disadvantage on this check if it attempts to remove the bullet from itself. On a successful check, the bullet is removed; however, on a failed check, the creature suffers 10 (3d6) radiant damage.

#### Warplock Jessail Tactics
These weapons teams serve as snipers and prioritize targeting enemies with high armor and low dexterity. They swiftly retreat when confronted in melee combat.

#### Warplock Jessail Upgrade Tactics 
**Rat-Eye Scopes.** This upgrade enhances the warplock jezzail's sniping capabilities. The weapons team must be defended by other creatures to make effective use of this upgrade. If the team isn't near death, their weapon remains operational, and their target is still within range and appears vulnerable, they will continue firing despite sources of disadvantage. 

**Sniper Jezzail.** This upgrade allows the warplock jezzail to carry out ambushes in places where other weapons can't. If the team uses the Scurry Away feature, they'll take their time to run until they can become hidden again before resuming fire.

### Two-Creature Weapon Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these weapons are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Two-Creature Weapon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

The Basic Weapon Loot Table should be used for the standard version of any of the two-creature weapons in this document. The Advanced Weapon Table should be used for the more powerful variant of any of the weapons.

##### Basic Weapon Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-6  | 1 5gp Item & 1d6(3) 5sp Items |

## Ratfolk Weapons Operators

In the deep and twisted labyrinths of the underworld, where survival is a test of cunning and ambition, the ratfolk have harnessed deadly innovations in a bid to claim power. Among their ranks, a special caste stands out - the Weapon Operators. These ratfolk are not merely the handlers of their lethal creations, but ambitious individuals eager to rise through the societal ranks, driven by the intoxicating allure of power these weapons offer.

The Weapon Operators are chosen for their cunning and strength, but their selection is just as much a product of their own ruthless ambition. They yearn for the power the weapons represent, covet the respect and fear they command in their kin's eyes, and aspire to the elevated status these roles bring within their clan.

Operating the ratfolk's terrifying arsenal is a display of dominance and superiority, a tangible sign of their high-ranking position. Each use of their weapon reinforces their status, reminding all around them of the raw power they control. It is a potent mix of fear and respect, a heady cocktail that fuels their ambition and desire to rise even higher.

However, the confidence these weapons bring only lasts so long as the battle is going in their favor. Ratfolk weapon operators are quick to abandon their weapons to save their own skins.  Those ratfolk who stick with their weapon while frightened and on the backfoot are more likely to make panicked and desperate decisions with their weapon.

<br><br><br><br>

 This ironically puts them in more danger as they increase the risk of a devastating mishap. Conversely, if the ratfolk feel they have their enemy on the backfoot and victory is at hand, they may also engage in reckless use of their weapon as they become overconfident, leading them to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory as they cause an untimely mishap.

As such, the path of the Weapon Operator is perilous, laden with risks as volatile as the weapons they wield. Many ambitious ratfolk, lured by the promise of power, meet an untimely end, falling victim to the very weapons they hoped would be their salvation. The weapons do not discriminate between friend and foe; a minor miscalculation or a moment's inattention can lead to a catastrophic explosion, reducing the ambitious ratfolk to a cautionary tale.

Ratfolk who survive long enough eventually become veteran weapon operators. Having endured countless battles and weapon malfunctions, these ratfolk have developed faster reflexed and become substantially tougher than their less experienced kin. They have a more intuitive understanding of how to push the limits of their weapon and maximize its destructive potential while limiting the risks to themselves. However, despite their veteran status, these ratfolk still carry the same tendencies as the rest of their kin and utilize the same underhanded and often cowardly tactics.

### Ratfolk Weapons Operator Tactics

Ratfolk weapons operators embody the typical behavior of other ratfolk but are emboldened by their high-powered weaponry. When they have the upper hand, they can be unrelenting bullies, acting recklessly due to their perceived omnipotence, which often leads to their downfall. Conversely, when overpowered or outmatched, panic tends to trigger reckless and drastic decisions, usually resulting in their own demise and potentially that of their foes as well.

Their tactics will vary depending on the weapon they are wielding, but there are some general guidelines:
* When using Scurry Away, ratfolk have the option to either abandon their post by dropping their weapon and fleeing or carry out a panicked job, which involves a hasty attempt at either repairing or firing the weapon again.
* If both ratfolk on the weapons team are wounded and cornered, they will choose to do a panicked job, retreating while desperately attempting to fix or fire the weapon. A frantic weapons team might take whatever risks necessary to maximize the damage potential of their weapon, often to comedic effect.
* If one of the team members has fallen, or if the weapon is damaged (it has less than half its hit points left), the team will likely abandon its post.
* Ratfolk with the optional Panicked Driver trait will abandon their vehicles as soon as they become immobile.

Much of the weaponry and vehicles available to ratfolk present options for high-risk, high-reward tactics. Ratfolk typically take greater risks under two conditions:
* When they are desperate, such as when they are cornered or near death.
* When they have gained the upper hand, they often get overzealous and strive for maximum power, even when it appears unnecessary. 

However, they generally avoid taking risks when the outcome of a fight seems uncertain.

#### Ratfolk Veteran Weapon Operators
Ratfolk veteran weapon operators have survived numerous weapon malfunctions and developed quick reflexes. Their survival is largely due to these reflexes rather than any specific tactical or technical knowledge. This means they generally behave similarly to standard weapon operators.

### Weapon Operator Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk weapon operators is identifying which materials they're carrying that still have functional value.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. If the identifying value materials the ratfolk was carrying will likely require an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check or a check using proficiency with appropriate tools, such as Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Alchemist's Supplies.


#### Weapon Operator Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
