# Two-Creature Weapons
Some weapons are so massive they require two creatures to move and operate them effectively. These weapons may be oversized firearms, large incendiary devices, or unwieldy melee weapons such as large drills. 

## Two-Creature Weapon Rules
Two-creature weapons require at least two creatures to operate them, and they come with the following additional considerations:


### The Weapons Team
The two creatures operating a two-creature weapon are known as the weapons team. The weapons team consists of a leader and a follower. Only one creature can be assigned to each role, and they cannot switch roles once assigned, even if one of the roles becomes vacant, unless they leave the weapons team and rejoin.

#### Joining a Weapons Team

Joining a two-creature weapons team costs a creature's action and half of its movement as it equips its part of the weapon. If one creature is already part of the weapons team, it may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature joining the team. Leaving a weapon team requires no action as the creature drops its part of the weapon.

A creature must have both hands available to be on a weapons team and can't pick anything else up without dropping its part of the weapon.

The creatures within a weapons team must stay within 5 feet of each other and the weapon at all times. If one of them is ever more than 5 feet away from the weapon or the other team member, it is no longer part of the team. 

#### Moving Two-Creature Weapons
The follower can no longer move on its turn except to leave the weapons team. The leader's speed becomes equal to the lowest speed among the creatures on the weapons team. Whenever the leader moves, it can choose to move the follower along with it if the follower is willing, even when the leader is moved against its will. 

#### Stealth
While part of a weapons team, a creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, activating a two-creature weapon reveals the weapons team's location if they are hidden.

\columnbreak

### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.


\pagebreakNum

## Two-Creature Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature needs to make a check for fixing mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning two-creature weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Actions station
By default, weapons can have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by creatures on their weapons teams. The Load and Crank functions can be activated by the follower, and the Fire function can be activated by the leader. Each function can only be activated once per round. 

#### Load
This function is used by the follower to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the follower to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition, and creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits the follower this way, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Crank
Not all weapons have this function. If a weapon does, it must be activated by the follower before each use of the Fire function to move the ammo or fuel through the weapon.

\columnbreak

#### Fire
The function is activated by the leader to fire the weapon. When this function is activated, but before its effect occurs, roll to see if a Mishap occurs. If a Mishap occurs, its effects happen before the effects of the Fire. This function can't be used if the weapon is out of ammo or if the weapon has a Crank function that hasn't been used since the weapon was last loaded or fired.

### Mishaps
Mishaps represent the weapon experiencing a significant malfunction. There is always a risk of this when firing the weapon, and some weapons have other circumstances that risk a mishap. Whenever this risk occurs, roll a d6. On a result of 1, a Mishap occurs, and the creature who triggered it must roll on the weapon's Mishap Table to determine the nature of this malfunction (see the Mishap Table section).

If the weapon has less than half its hit points, roll 2d6 and take the lowest result when checking for a mishap. 

Unless stated otherwise, you must always check for a mishap when activating the Fire function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Most weapons have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways their functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishap Table.

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

### Ratling Gun Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a ratling gun. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Ratling Coolant.** When rolling to check for a mishap with the weapon, you can choose to disregard one of the d6s you roll (if you're only rolling 1d6, you can negate the need to roll.) If the weapon incurs damage that reduces its hit points to half or less, or if a mishap occurs, the coolant bursts. The burst coolant forces each creature within a 10-foot radius of the weapon to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, suffering 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. The coolant burst is resolved prior to any Mishaps that triggered this event. Oncet the coolant bursts, the weapon loses this ability until it fully regains its hit points.

**Rot Shots.** Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire function, it sustains a wound. At the end of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage per wound. A creature can have multiple wounds simultaneously. Wounds can be healed if the creature regains 10 or more hit points, or if a use of a healer's kit is expended on it. Alternatively, the wounded creature or another creature within 5 feet can make a DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action, ending all wounds on a success.

**On-Board Ammo Assembler.** When the follower is using the weapon's Load function, they can choose to salvage parts from an unmanned two-creature weapon or vehicle with a CR of 3 or higher within 5 feet, provided it has at least 30 hit points. Doing so inflicts 30 damage to the salvaged weapon or vehicle. If this reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is dismantled and cannot be used for further salvaging. The follower gains a special ammo belt made from the salvaged parts that lasts for one minute. While using this ammo, the weapon deals an additional 13 (2d12) damage with its Fire function, but the function triggers a Mishap on a roll of 1 or 2 when using this ammo.

### Warplock Jezzail Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a Warplock Jezzail. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Rat-Eye Scopes.** At the end of the team leader's turn, if they have not moved, they can choose to take aim at a creature within 400 feet that they can see. The leader maintains its aim at the target until the leader moves, or the leader can no longer see the target, or the target moves more than 400 feet away from the team leader. While the leader maintains this aim, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against the weapon's Fire function.

**Sniper Jezzail.** A creature doesn't have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while part of the weapons team, and creatures on the weapons team can traverse or halt in a space large enough to accommodate an object one size smaller than themselves without squeezing. Additionally, using the weapon doesn't reveal the weapons team's position to other creatures they are more than 30 feet away from.

**Embedding Rounds.** When a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire ability, the bullet embeds in the target for one minute. While embedded, the creature cannot regain hit points, and at the end of each of its turns, it takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage. The target creature or another creature within 5 feet can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check, attempting to extract the bullet. The target creature has disadvantage on this check if it attempts to remove the bullet from itself. On a successful check, the bullet is removed; however, on a failed check, the creature suffers 10 (3d6) radiant damage.

### Poisoned Wind Mortar Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a Poisoned Wind Mortor. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

* **Acid Blast.** When the weapon's ammo shatter at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the weapon's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (The orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

* **Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the weapon's ammo deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

* **Warp Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the weapon's ammo, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
