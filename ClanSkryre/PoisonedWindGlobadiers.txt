## Poisoned Wind <br> Globadiers

This insidious ratfolk infantry specializes in the <br> use of poisoned wind globes. These glass orbs <br> unleash clouds of toxic gas when they shatter, <br> overwhelming groups of foes with choking fumes. <br> A squad of these ratfolk can bring down entire enemy formations with poison gas, and they are especially <br> adept at fumigating foes trapped in enclosed spaces. <br> As such, poisoned-wind globadiers  are often used to <br> deal with enemies bunkered within rooms or <br> enclosed fortifications.

Poisoned-wind globadiers wear heavy robes and <br> gas masks made to protect them from their poisons, <br> though, in combat, this gear does not protect them <br> entirely from their gasses. This, combined with the <br> fragility of the poisoned wind globes they carry, <br> makes heavy combat hazardous for these ratfolk, <br> and many a globadier has died to the same gases <br> that slew its foes. As such, most globadiers stay out <br> of the fray, dropping poisoned globes in the path of <br> pursuers or hurling them into crowds at a distance.

>
> ***Poisoned Wind Globe (3/day)*** If ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can hurl the globe at a point it can see within 20 feet.

>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn.

This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

### Death Globe Bombardiers

The death globe bombardiers, the elite cadre of the ratfolk's poisoned-wind infantry, represent the pinnacle of alchemical warfare. Known among their kin as the harbingers of annihilation, they are surrounded by an air of dread and respect, born out of their deadly expertise and the horrifying effectiveness of their weaponry.

The death globes they carry are a testament to their terrifying alchemical skills. Larger and more intricately constructed than regular poisoned wind globes, these lethal weapons contain concentrated concoctions of the deadliest gases known to ratfolk alchemy. A single death globe can release a cloud of poisonous gas so vast and deadly that it can wipe out an entire battalion.

Death globe bombardiers are often assigned critical missions that require the complete eradication of enemy forces or to breach heavily fortified positions. Despite their elite status, bombardiers are still viewed with a certain amount of trepidation by their peers. The deadly potency of their globes and the high casualty rate in their ranks serves as a constant reminder of the thin line they tread between life and death.

### New Items: Poisoned Wind Globes

#### Poisoned Wind Globes
___
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Poisoned wind globes are orbs made of glass or crystal and filled with deadly gas. When shattered, the spheres release billowing toxic clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.

#### Death Globes
___
- **Cost:** 100 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Death globes are built with the same function as poisoned wind globes, but the gasses they carry are far more potent and capable of enveloping a much larger area.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 10-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.

#### Poisoned Wind Globe & Death Globe Upgrades

These effects can be added to poisoned wind globes or death globes to enhance their lethality. The cost of the globe is increased by 100 gold per upgrade added. If they're added to the globes used ratfolk poisoned wind globadiers or ratfolk death globe bombardiers, their CR goes up by 1 per upgrade applied to their globes.

* **Acid Blast.** When the orb shatters at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the orb's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (This orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

* **Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the orb deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

* **Warp Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the orb, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

### New Feat: Poisoned Wind Fumigator
You've become a master of crafting and utilizing poisoned wind globes to maximum effect, and you can even implement globes with gases specialized in poisoning creatures normally resistant or immune to such effects. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kit, or glassblower's tools

* You may have the saving throw for a poisoned wind globe or death globe you throw become 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, and you may add your Intelligence modifier to the poison damage its gas cloud deals.

* At the end of each long rest, choose a creature type other than construct. Creatures of the chosen creature type don't benefit from resistance or immunity to poison damage from poisoned wind globes and death globes you throw unless they are under the effect of the *protection from poison* spell.

* If you are proficient with glassblowers tools and either alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kits, and you have them in hand, you can create a new poisoned wind globe from the remains of one that has shattered within the last hour. To do so, you must expend 25 gp worth of alchemist's supplies or poisons over the course of 1 minute to turn the shattered globe into a new poisoned wind globe.

### Poisoned Wind Globadier Tactics  
The poisoned wind globadiers play a crucial role in disrupting enemy groups by acting as debuffers and providing cover for their army. They achieve this by deploying poison gas clouds to blind their opponents. While they are immune to the full effects of the poison wind orbs they handle, they still exercise caution. Close combat is avoided, as any melee attack could accidentally shatter the orbs before they are thrown. To prevent such mishaps, they prefer to keep at least 30 feet from their targets while hurling the orbs, employing the Devious Globadier ability to maintain this distance effectively.

When an opponent is severely injured and poisoned, and the globadiers have numerical superiority, they may decide to move in and switch to dagger attacks.

It's important that other ratfolk avoid close proximity to poisoned wind globadiers due to the fear of a globe accidentally shattering. Even when fighting in a group, multiple poisoned wind globadiers spread out from each other, converging only when preparing to engage in melee combat.

### Poisoned Wind Globadier Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk engineers is identifying what equipment they're carrying still has any functional value. They may also drop poisoned wind globes the players can collect for their own use or sale to black market vendors.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. 

#### Warlock Engineer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
