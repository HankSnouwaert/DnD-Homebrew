## Forbidden Devices

Ratfolk warlock-engineers possess a unique arsenal of magic items specifically designed for use against their adversaries. A Warlock Engineer can select two items, while a Warlock Master can select three from the list below. They can choose the same device more than once. Each device requires an action to use and can't be used again until the warlock has had time to rebuild it using Smith's Tools during a long rest.


### Brass Orb (Warlock Master Only)
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If the ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can throw the device at a point it can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) force damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When the ratfolk attempts to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the ratfolk this way, it drops the brass orb, which detonates at its location.


### Doom Rocket
When launched, this missile shrieks through the air before striking the ground and unleashing a wave of bright, glowing green light that irradiates anything near the impact site.

The ratfolk cannot use this device if it is restrained or grappled. When the ratfolk uses the Doom Rocket, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and launches it at a point it can see within 120 feet. The rocket detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage plus an additional 5 (1d10) radiant damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the ratfolk attempts to launch the rocket, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits the ratfolk in this way, the rocket misfires and detonates at its location.


### Earth Render

This mechanized spike jackhammers into the ground, creating a localized earthquake capable of reducing the structures of surface dwellers into rubble.

When the ratfolk uses the Earth Render, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and rams the device into the ground, creating violent tremors. Each creature in a 25-foot cube originating from the ratfolk must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. Structures in the area take double damage from the effect.


### Warp Lighting Generator
This strange metallic device hums with power before emitting a tremendous bolt of green lightning.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Lightning Generator, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and hurls a magical green lightning bolt at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its reaction.
 
### Warp Fume Sprayer
This device's canister contains toxic gases that can be expelled in a wave through a large, rusty nozzle. 

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Fume Sprayer, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and sprays toxic fumes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage plus an additional 5 (1d8) poison damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become poisoned until the start of the ratfolk's next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.


### Warp Scorcher
This arm-mounted flamethrower spews lines of flames that cling to anything in their path.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Scorcher, it expends all its eldritch energy levels to unleash a gout of flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in the direction of its choice. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) fire damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be set on fire. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't set on fire. A creature that's been set on fire this way takes 4 (1d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse the fire.

## New Items

### New Magic Item

#### Brass Orb
*Wondrous item, rare*<br>
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If you are not restrained or grappled, you can use an action to hurl this item at a point you can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another chaotic plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against you. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the brass orb, and it detonates at your location.

##### Ratfolk Warlock Engineer & Warlock Master Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Gibbon Take:** Gibbons have begun sneaking into a jungle village and stealing valuables that catch their eye. The party has been hired to venture into the jungle treetops and retrieve the most valuable stolen goods by stealing them back or perhaps even trying to trade them back from the gibbons.|
|  2  |**The Chimp's Riddle:** A small troupe of chimpanzees has recently started to invade a local town, causing mischief and chaos. It seems they are searching for something specific in the town's library. The adventurers are hired to find a way to communicate with the chimps and figure out what they're after, all while avoiding the ire of the town's increasingly frustrated librarian.|
|  3 | **Chimpanzee Heist:** A group of highly intelligent chimps have escaped from a wizard's lab and stolen a valuable magical artifact. The chimps are causing chaos and mayhem in the city as they evade capture. The adventurers must outwit and recapture them without causing harm, retrieve the artifact, and unravel the mystery behind their unusual intelligence.|
|  4  |**The Jufu Threat:** A nearby mountain pass, crucial for trade, has recently been taken over by a group of Jufus who throw rocks at anyone who attempts to cross. The adventurers must clear the path, either by driving away the Jufus or finding a way to appease them. This could involve strategic combat, using the terrain to their advantage, or an intricate negotiation using sign language and gestures.|
|  5  |**The Jufu's Stolen Treasure:** A clan of Jufus renowned for their collection of precious gems have had their treasure stolen by a rogue band of mountain bandits. The Jufus have become restless and started attacking local villages. The adventurers must track down the bandits, retrieve the treasure, and return it to the Jufus to restore peace.|
|  6  | **The Gorilla Stampede:** The gorillas in the region have started to stampede without any apparent reason, causing destruction in their wake. The adventurers are hired to find the source of their unusual behavior. This could lead them to a group of poachers, a dangerous beast terrorizing the gorillas, or a seismic activity that’s about to cause a major natural disaster.|

### Warlock Engineer Tactics
Warlock engineers, along with master engineers, are extremely intelligent ratfolk who delight in testing their diabolical weaponry on players. In combat, their primary objective is to eliminate as many targets as possible using their advanced artillery, often disregarding the casualties of their own minions caught in the crossfire.

Warlock engineers possess a versatile arsenal, including ranged attacks, area of effect damage, and some melee capabilities. When provided with a vehicle, they can also serve as cavalry units, making their tactical approach highly adaptable. Their power output each turn depends on their eldritch power level.
Here are some typical action sequences for a warlock engineer:

**Initiation With The Pistol.** At the start of combat, the engineer will attempt to fire its pistol, reload as a bonus action, and fire again, maximizing damage against a target surrounded by minions.

**Closing In With The Warp Blade.** The warlock engineer can also utilize its warp blade, which consumes eldritch power levels for amplified damage. When opting for this strategy, the warlock engineer will usually first shoot with the pistol, then engage in melee combat with the warp blade. This attack option is best used when an enemy is lower on health or when the ratfolk and its allies greatly outnumber their opponents.

**Using a Warpmusket.** If equipped with a musket, the engineer maintains a greater distance from enemies while firing at surrounded foes so it can make use of its Cverwhelming Mass feature.

#### Forbidden Devices

When deciding whether to use Forbidden Devices, the engineer considers the available eldritch power levels and the number of potential targets. A handy trick when trying to decide if the engineer will use a device on any given turn is to consider each power level it has and the number of targets it could hit as individual incentives. At the start of its turn, if there are 4 or more "incentives," it will likely use the device on that turn.

The engineer does not hesitate to sacrifice its own minions when using its devices unless the minions hold significant value. Lesser ratfolk soldiers are generally considered disposable.

#### Retreat 
Warlocks retreat from combat when they're outnumbered two to one in melee, their health drops below one-third, or they run out of Forbidden Devices or minions. During a retreat, they can still reload their weapon, enabling the engineer with a musket to keep its distance from melee opponents while taking pot shots at their pursuers.

#### Serving As Repair Rats
With their high-level tools skills and ability to perform tool checks even while frightened by their Scurry Away feature, warlock engineers can act as mobile repair rats, helping sustain weapons teams or vehicles. They cease repairs only when there is nothing left to fix or when deploying a Forbidden Device presents a greater incentive.

For a warlock engineer serving as a backline repair rat, equipping them with doom rockets, a warp lightning generator, and a musket is recommended, as this allows them to function as true artillery masters.

#### Mounted on Vehicles

Warlock engineers with vehicles stick to ranged attacks combined with opportunistic hit-and-run strikes. They assault the enemy with Forbidden Devices and gunfire, then charge when they identify a weakness or accumulate a significant number of eldritch power levels for a high-damage vehicle crash. The thrill of crushing an enemy with a lightning-fast vehicle often entices engineers to charge in, even when it may not be the most strategic choice. An engineer armed with a warp blade and warplock pistol is more inclined to engage in melee combat compared to one equipped with a musket.

### Ape Loot
The valuable items looted from apes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Apes don’t provide quite as much quality harvesting materials as other beasts, but because giant apes and titanic apes are more intelligent, they may wear or keep more valuable items they’ve collected. If you’re using a giant or titanic ape in a climactic battle, it is usually good to provide some high-value “art objects” from the DMG they’ve collected for players to find. 


#### Ape Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Chimpanzee Loot Table 

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | 1 5sp Item |
|  6-8 | 1d6(3) 5sp Items | 
|  9-15 | 1d4(2) 1gp Items  |  
|  16-20 | 1d6(3) 1gp Items  |  
|  21+ |  1d4(2) 2gp Items |  

##### Jufu Loot Table 

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | 1d6(3) 5sp Items |
|  6-11 | 1d6(3) 1gp Items | 
|  12-19 | 1d4(2) 2gp Items  |  
|  20+ |  1d6(3) 2gp Items |   

#### Example Ape Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Common Ape Item Names
|1d4 | 5sp Item | 1gp Item | 2gp Item | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 <br> (Bone)  |   Cracked Simian Bone |  Simian Bone |  Pristine Simian Bone  | 
| 2 <br> (Flesh) | Stringy Simian Meat| Simian Meat|  Prime Simian Meat  | 
| 3 (Fluid)  | Clotted Simian Blood | Simian Blood |  Pristine Simian Blood  | 
| 4 <br> (Hide)  | Tattered Simian Pelt | Simian Pelt |  Pristine Simian Pelt  | 

##### Example Giant Ape Item Names
|1d4 | 5gp Item | 10gp Item | 20gp Item | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 <br> (Bone)  |   Cracked Giant <br> Ape Bone |  Giant Ape Bone |  Pristine Giant <br> Ape Bone  |
