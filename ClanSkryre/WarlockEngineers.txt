## Ratfolk Warlock Engineers

The warlock-engineers are a horrifying fusion of sorcerer, scientist, and engineer, embodying the raw ambition and unbounded deviousness of the ratfolk. They are selected from the most cunning and intelligent of their brood, demonstrating exceptional skill and a ruthless ingenuity to rise above their kin.

Their role is dual-natured, as they devote equal time to the study of arcane arts and the sciences of engineering and alchemy. Their lairs are often cluttered with both arcane artifacts and complex mechanical devices. They use their knowledge to forge devastating weapons, animate mad vehicles, and manipulate the very fabric of reality.

A warlock-engineer is a terrifying sight to behold, a grim fusion of organic and mechanical. Their hunched bodies, wrapped in shadowy robes, are an intricate network of self-made, mechanical augmentations and arcane devices, often lit by the eerie glow of the irradiated minerals they utilize.

They stand slightly taller than the average ratfolk, though their hunched posture can sometimes belie their true height. Their fur is usually patchy and discolored from constant exposure to their potent power source, and their eyes gleam with an unsettling, predatory intelligence.

Body parts lost in combat or laboratory mishaps are commonly replaced with mechanical augmentations. These range from simple, metallic prosthetics to complex contraptions designed to enhance physical capabilities. A Warlock-Engineer might have a multi-jointed mechanical arm equipped with various tools and weaponry, or a prosthetic leg with incorporated shock-absorbing springs for enhanced agility.

Their heads are often adorned with complex eyepieces that serve as telescopes, microscopes, or even as targeting systems for their weapons. They might have a network of tubes and wires injected into their bodies, delivering a constant supply of the irradiated minerals to boost their magical prowess and physical resilience.

The Warlock-Engineers are known for their intricate and devastating arsenal, a testament to their wicked blend of magic and technology. Their weapons, powered by the potent, irradiated minerals they mine from the depths, are as diverse as they are deadly.

Warlock-Engineers have innovated a line of firearms that stand apart from any standard weaponry. These include eldritch muskets and pistols whose barrels are etched with arcane runes and loaded with shards of the irradiated mineral, not mere lead shot. When fired, these weapons unleash blasts of magical energy that can tear through armor and sear flesh, leaving behind wounds that fester with otherworldly radiation.

Beyond these "standard" weapons, each engineer builds their own custom devious devices to bring into battle and test on unwitting foes. These machines range from flamethrowers to rocket launchers to machines capable of generating seismic tremors. This makes every encounter with a warlock engineer a wildly unpredictable affair, as there's no predicting what the mad rat will whip out next.

To power these devious devices, warlock engineers can channel eldritch power through their partially mechanical forms, building up higher and higher levels over time. Once their bodies are crackling with power, they will channel it all through one of their deadly weapons, unleashing a wave of devastation upon as many foes as possible. If a few minions become collateral damage in the process, then so be it. It's a small price to pay for a successful weapons test.

### Warlock Masters

The Warlock Masters are the epitome of the ratfolk's insidious ambition and genius, representing the pinnacle of their society's arcane-technological mastery. They are the warlock engineers' most accomplished, the most advanced, and the maddest of the mad, possessing the deadliest inventions and the power to command and control their brethren. Their status is not given lightly; each Warlock Master must prove their worth through arcane prowess, engineering genius, and a ruthless drive for power. 


Warlock Masters are often more machine than flesh, with a plethora of mechanical limbs, arcane enhancements, and complex devices incorporated into their being. Their enhancements are the most sophisticated, often made from rare and highly durable materials, imbued with powerful spells for protection and strength. Some even replace their hearts with mechanical pumps powered by irradiated minerals, extending their lifespan and imbuing them with incredible resilience.

A Warlock Master's workshop is a sprawling labyrinth of machinery and magic, stretching across massive underground halls. Here, amidst the controlled chaos of their laboratories, they construct their masterpieces of destruction. The air buzzes with raw arcane power, while countless mechanical constructs work tirelessly to bring their master's visions to life.

As the leaders of their society, Warlock Masters hold the highest authority, guiding the actions of their underlings with an iron fist. Their word is law in the warren, and their orders are executed without question. However, their authority is not entirely unchallenged, as each Warlock Master is a potential rival, leading to a complex web of alliances, betrayals, and power struggles within their ranks.

Above all, Warlock Masters are visionaries in their own twisted way. They harbor grand dreams of surfacing from their subterranean confines to dominate the world above. And through their ever-evolving schemes and growing arsenal of minions and mad machinery, they are always moving closer to making their dreams a reality.

## Forbidden Devices

Ratfolk warlock-engineers possess a unique arsenal of magic items specifically designed for use against their adversaries. A Warlock Engineer can select two items, while a Warlock Master can select three from the list below. They can choose the same device more than once. Each device requires an action to use and can't be used again until the warlock has had time to rebuild it using Smith's Tools during a long rest.


### Brass Orb (Warlock Master Only)
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If the ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can throw the device at a point it can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) force damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When the ratfolk attempts to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the ratfolk this way, it drops the brass orb, which detonates at its location.


### Doom Rocket
When launched, this missile shrieks through the air before striking the ground and unleashing a wave of bright, glowing green light that irradiates anything near the impact site.

The ratfolk cannot use this device if it is restrained or grappled. When the ratfolk uses the Doom Rocket, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and launches it at a point it can see within 120 feet. The rocket detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage plus an additional 5 (1d10) radiant damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the ratfolk attempts to launch the rocket, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits the ratfolk in this way, the rocket misfires and detonates at its location.

### Earth Render

This mechanized spike jackhammers into the ground, creating a localized earthquake capable of reducing the structures of surface dwellers into rubble.

When the ratfolk uses the Earth Render, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and rams the device into the ground, creating violent tremors. Each creature in a 25-foot cube originating from the ratfolk must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. Structures in the area take double damage from the effect.


### Warp Lighting Generator
This strange metallic device hums with power before emitting a tremendous bolt of green lightning.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Lightning Generator, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and hurls a magical green lightning bolt at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its reaction.
 
\columnbreak 


 
### Warp Fume Sprayer
This device's canister contains toxic gases that can be expelled in a wave through a large, rusty nozzle. 

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Fume Sprayer, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and sprays toxic fumes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage plus an additional 5 (1d8) poison damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become poisoned until the start of the ratfolk's next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.


### Warp Scorcher
This arm-mounted flamethrower spews lines of flames that cling to anything in their path.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Scorcher, it expends all its eldritch energy levels to unleash a gout of flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in the direction of its choice. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) fire damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be set on fire. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't set on fire. A creature that's been set on fire this way takes 4 (1d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse the fire.

### Warlock Engineer Tactics
Warlock engineers, along with master engineers, are extremely intelligent ratfolk who delight in testing their diabolical weaponry on players. In combat, their primary objective is to eliminate as many targets as possible using their advanced artillery, often disregarding the casualties of their own minions caught in the crossfire.

Warlock engineers possess a versatile arsenal, including ranged attacks, area of effect damage, and some melee capabilities. When using a vehicle, they can also serve as cavalry units, making their tactical approach highly adaptable. Their power output each turn depends on their eldritch power level.

**Initiation.** At the start of combat, the engineer will attempt to fire its pistol, reload as a bonus action, and fire again, maximizing damage against a target surrounded by minions.

**Closing In.** The warlock engineer can also utilize its warp blade, which consumes eldritch power levels for amplified damage. When opting for this strategy, the warlock engineer will usually first shoot with the pistol, then engage in melee combat with the warp blade. This attack option is best used when an enemy is lower on health or when the ratfolk and its allies greatly outnumber their opponents.

**Warpmuskets.** If equipped with a musket, the engineer maintains a greater distance from enemies while firing at surrounded foes to use its Overwhelming Mass feature.

#### Forbidden Devices

When deciding whether to use Forbidden Devices, the engineer considers the available eldritch power levels and the number of potential targets. A handy trick when trying to decide if the engineer will use a device on any given turn is to consider each power level it has and the number of targets it could hit as individual incentives. At the start of its turn, if there are 4 or more "incentives," it will likely use the device.

\columnbreak

The engineer does not hesitate to sacrifice its own minions when using its devices unless the minions hold significant value. Lesser ratfolk soldiers are generally considered disposable.



#### Retreat 
Warlocks retreat from combat when they're outnumbered two to one in melee, their health drops below one-third, or they run out of Forbidden Devices or minions. During a retreat, they can still reload their weapon, enabling the engineer with a musket to keep its distance from melee opponents while taking pot shots at their pursuers.

#### Serving As Repair Rats
With their high-level tools skills and ability to perform tool checks even while frightened by their Scurry Away feature, warlock engineers can act as mobile repair rats, helping sustain weapons teams or vehicles. They cease repairs only when there is nothing left to fix or when deploying a Forbidden Device presents a greater incentive.

For a warlock engineer serving as a backline repair rat, equipping them with doom rockets, a warp lightning generator, and a musket is recommended, as this allows them to function as true artillery masters.

#### Mounted on Vehicles

Warlock engineers with vehicles stick to ranged attacks combined with opportunistic hit-and-run strikes. They assault the enemy with Forbidden Devices and gunfire, then charge when they identify a weakness or accumulate a significant number of eldritch power levels for a high-damage vehicle crash. The thrill of crushing an enemy with a lightning-fast vehicle often entices engineers to charge in, even when it may not be the most strategic choice. An engineer armed with a warp blade and warplock pistol is more inclined to engage in melee combat compared to one equipped with a musket.

### Warlock Engineer Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk engineers is identifying what devices they're carrying still have any functional value.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. If the identifying value materials the ratfolk was carrying will likely require an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check or a check using proficiency with appropriate tools, such as Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Alchemist's Supplies.


#### Warlock Engineer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## New Items

### New Magic Item

#### Brass Orb
*Wondrous item, rare*<br>
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If you are not restrained or grappled, you can use an action to hurl this item at a point you can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another chaotic plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against you. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the brass orb, and it detonates at your location.

### New Weapon Properties 
&emsp;**Reload (X).** This weapon can be fired X times before it must be reloaded using an action or in place of an attack that's part of an attack action or in place of an off-hand attack while duel wielding. The weapon can be reloaded early without losing any ammunition.

**Warpbullets.** This weapon requires special ammunition known as warpbullets which weapons cannot use unless they have this property. Attacks using this ammunition count as magical, and on hit, their target takes additional 2d6 radiant damage. When you make an attack using warpbullets, if the result of your attack roll is 3 or less, the attack automatically misses as the weapon misfires, and you take damage as though the weapon attack has hit you.
