## Forbidden Devices

Ratfolk warlock-engineers possess a unique arsenal of magic items specifically designed for use against their adversaries. A Warlock Engineer can select two items, while a Warlock Master can select three from the list below. They can choose the same device more than once. Each device requires an action to use and can't be used again until the warlock has had time to rebuild it using Smith's Tools during a long rest.

### Earth Render

This mechanized spike jackhammers into the ground, creating a localized earthquake capable of reducing the structures of surface dwellers into rubble.

When the ratfolk uses the Earth Render, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and rams the device into the ground, creating violent tremors. Each creature in a 25-foot cube originating from the ratfolk must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. Structures in the area take double damage from the effect.

### Warp Scorcher
This arm-mounted flamethrower spews lines of flames that cling to anything in their path.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Scorcher, it expends all its eldritch energy levels to unleash a gout of flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in the direction of its choice. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) fire damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be set on fire. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't set on fire. A creature that's been set on fire this way takes 4 (1d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse the fire.

### Warp Lighting Generator
This strange metallic device hums with power before emitting a tremendous bolt of green lightning.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Lightning Generator, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and hurls a magical green lightning bolt at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its reaction.
 
### Warp Mist Sprayer
This device's canister contains toxic gases that can be expelled in a wave through a large, rusty nozzle. 

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Mist Sprayer, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and sprays toxic fumes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage plus an additional 5 (1d8) poison damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become poisoned until the start of the ratfolk's next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

### Brass Orb (Warlock Master Only)
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If the ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can throw the device at a point it can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) force damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When the ratfolk attempts to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the ratfolk this way, it drops the brass orb, which detonates at its location.


### Doom Rocket
When launched, this missile shrieks through the air before striking the ground and unleashing a wave of bright, glowing green light that irradiates anything near the impact site.

The ratfolk cannot use this device if it is restrained or grappled. When the ratfolk uses the Doom Rocket, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and launches it at a point it can see within 120 feet. The rocket detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage plus an additional 5 (1d10) radiant damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the ratfolk attempts to launch the rocket, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits the ratfolk in this way, the rocket misfires and detonates at its location.

## New Items

### New Magic Item

#### Brass Orb
*Wondrous item, rare*<br>
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If you are not restrained or grappled, you can use an action to hurl this item at a point you can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another chaotic plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against you. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the brass orb, and it detonates at your location.

### New Weapon Properties 
&emsp;**Reload (X).** This weapon can be fired X times before it must be reloaded using an action or in place of an attack that's part of an attack action or in place of an off-hand attack while duel wielding. The weapon can be reloaded early without losing any ammunition.

**Warpbullets.** This weapon requires special ammunition known as warpbullets which weapons cannot use unless they have this property. Attacks using this ammunition count as magical, and on hit, their target takes additional 2d6 radiant damage. When you make an attack using warpbullets, if the result of your attack roll is 3 or less, the attack automatically misses as the weapon misfires, and you take damage as though the weapon attack has hit you.
