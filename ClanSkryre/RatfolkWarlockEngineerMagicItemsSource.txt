## Ratfolk Warlock-Engineer Magic Items

#### Brass Orb
*Wondrous item, 2560gp, very rare, weight: 2 lb*<br>
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs <Br> is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear <Br> in reality.

If you are not restrained or grappled, you can use an action to hurl this item at a point you can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point which destroys it and forces each creature within 15 feet of it thatâ€™s not behind total cover to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished <br> to another chaotic plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against you. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the brass orb, and it detonates at your location.

#### Gnaw Bomb
*Wonderous item, 200gp, weight: 1 lb*

When this chaotic device is detonated, it releases wild arcane energy, temporarily tearing a hole in the fabric of reality.

You can use an action to throw the gnaw bomb up to 30 feet where it detonates, creating a 5-foot diameter portal ("gnaw hole") lasting one minute. Creatures caught within this area that do not have total cover must make a DC 15 Constitution save, taking 10 (3d6) force damage on failuer or half as muchf on a success.

A creature can enter a gnaw hole to emerge from another on that's within 120 feet. A gnaw hole requires 5 feet of movement to enter. Upon entry, the creature knows the location of all other gnaw holes within range and can exit from any of them, appearing within 5 feet of the chosen gnaw hole, otherwise it pops back out within of the gnaw hole it entered. A creature can only be tranported to another gnaw hole this way once per round.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the gnaw bomb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against you. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the gnaw bomb, and it detonates at your location.

#### Esoteric Warp Resonator
*Wonderous item, rare, 500gp, weight: 1 lb*

This sealed orb, features thirteen intricate dials and pulses with warp energy each time its dials are adjusted.

The esoteric warp resonator holds 13 charges. As an action, a creature can expend and number of the resonator's charges to recharge an equal number of expended charges on a magic item created by an Artificer Infusion (as described in Infuse Item class ability of the artificer from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*.)

#### Oil of Explosive Speed
*Potion, 50gp, uncommon, weight: 1 lb*

This vial contains volatile eldritch oil, which can be used to momentarily enhance a vehicle with explosive speed.

When piloting a vehicle, a creature can use its action to inject this oil into the vehicle, consuming it. The vehicle's speed doubles for the turn. If the vehicle has a Mishaps Table, at the turn's end, roll a d6. On a 6, the vehicle suffers a mishap.

#### Storm Daemon
*Halberd, rare, 4,000gp (requires attunement), weight 9 lb*<br>

This tall, warpstone-powered halberd was crafted by the master warlock engineers of the ratfolk. Copper wire coils wrap around its shaft, adorned with luminous warp stone chunks. It crackles with energy, drawing power from its warp generator to unleash bolts of dark lightning.

**Eldritch Power:** At the start of your turn, unless incapacitated, you may harness the Storm Demon's eldritch might. Roll 1d4. You gain eldritch power levels equal to the result, lasting one minute or until you invoke this feature again. Rolling a 4 causes you to take 4d8 lightning damage, which cannot be reduced by any means.

**Eldritch Strike:** When you hit a target with the halberd, you may expend your accumulated eldritch power levels to deal an extra 1d10 lightning damage per level expended.

**Ranged Spell Attack:** The halberd can be used to make ranged spell attacks with a range of 100/400 ft. Add your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, you expend all your eldritch power levels to deal 1d10 lightning damage per level expended, plus your Intelligence modifier.
