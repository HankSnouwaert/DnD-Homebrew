#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

\columnbreak

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Warp Lightning Cannons
The warp lightning wannon is a massive, wheeled contraption that bristles with crackling energy. Constructed from a combination of scavenged metal and mysterious components, the cannons are powered by a rare and volatile energy source harnessed from the raw forces of chaos. Ratfolk engineers channel this energy into the cannon's twisted mechanisms, preparing it to unleash its devastating power.

When activated, the warp lightning cannon fires lethal bolts of crackling, coruscating energy. These electrifying projectiles surge forth, capable of piercing through the toughest armor and obliterating enemy formations with explosive force. The destructive potential of the warp lightning cannon is unmatched, making it a prized asset in the ratfolk's arsenal of war machines.

However, its power is not easily controlled, and warp lightning cannons are as dangerous to their operators as they are to their enemies. The unleashed energy often surges uncontrollably, causing catastrophic feedback that can result in explosions or the cannon tearing itself apart. Only the most skilled and daring ratfolk engineers dare to operate these deadly devices, often as a testament to their ambition and thirst for power.

The ratfolk clans jealously guard the secrets of creating and operating warp lightning cannons, considering them a potent symbol of their supremacy and a means to assert dominance over their rivals. Despite the best efforts of the ratfolk, warp lightning cannons do occasionally fall into the hands of their rivals, who are quick to modify them for their own uses in war. When brought to bear on the battlefield, the eerie glow of the cannon's energy casts a chilling pall over friend and foe alike, foretelling the chaos and destruction to come.

### Warp Lightning Cannon Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warp lightning cannon. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

* **Warp Conduit.** When a creature makes a saving throw against the cannon's Fire function due to being in the area of its lightning, all other creatures within 5 feet of that creature must also make the saving throw against the effect as the electricity arcs between them. This arcing causes the original creature, and everyone the lightning arced to, to suffer disadvantage on their saving throws.
* **Regenerating Radiation.** When a creature preps or loads the cannon, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, it gains a level of exhaustion and regains 15 hit points. A creature immune to exhaustion cannot gain hit points this way.
* **Warpstone Dynamos.** The cannon no longer experiences mishaps when rolling for the length of its lightning blast. Instead, when the cannon rolls for the length of the line, it gains a charge for each 4 rolled on a d4 that lasts one minute. The cannon deals an additional 4 (1d8) damage per charge it has. However, if the weapon ever gains 4 or more charges, it suffers the Energy Overload Mishap. This mishap causes the cannon to take 71 (8d8) + 35 lightning damage and lose all its charges. If reduced to 0 hit points this way, the cannon experiences the Meltdown mishap.

### Warp Lightning Cannon Tactics

The warp lightning cannon serves as a powerful piece of artillery. Unlike many other artillery pieces, it fires in a straight line, which means that allied troops in front of it must clear a path for its lightning blast. Alternatively, the crew can choose to fire through expendable allies to reach prime enemy targets. Bogging down foes in such allies can be an effective way to ensure they can't escape the cannon's blasts.

#### Warp Lightning Cannon Upgrade Tactics

**Warp Conduit.** This upgrade is particularly useful when there are many expendable units on the front line. These additional bodies can be utilized to impose disadvantage on enemies' saving throws by triggering the arcing lightning effect.

**Regenerating Radiation.** This upgrade works best with expendable, less capable creatures working the cannon, as it keeps them alive but limits their combat effectiveness. However, its usefulness diminishes when the crew is more proficient in combat, as engaging with foes directly can be used as a last resort if the cannon becomes inoperable for some reason.

**Warpstone Dynamos.** This upgrade turns the weapon into a truly chaotic device. The predictability of its operations can be drastically reduced, leading to unforeseen outcomes on the battlefield.
