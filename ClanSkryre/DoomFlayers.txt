## Doom Flayer
The doom flayers are imposing contraptions, reminiscent of giant, twisted cogs that screech and grind as they surge forward. Propelled by their spinning wheels, the vehicles possess incredible speed, allowing them to swiftly close in on their foes, leaving chaos and destruction in their wake.

Mounted on each doom flayer is a skilled ratfolk driver, operating the complex controls and piloting the vehicle with unmatched precision. The doom flayers are often deployed in the vanguard of ratfolk armies, charging into enemy lines with ruthless efficiency.

<br><br><br><br><br>

 Armed with gnashing blades and deadly weapons, they eagerly carve a path through enemy ranks, dismembering all who dare stand in their way.

However, despite their formidable strength, the doom flayers are not without their risks. The unstable combination of engineering and sorcery makes them unpredictable, and accidents or malfunctions can result in catastrophic consequences, claiming the lives of both their operators and enemies alike.

##### Doom Flayer Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Rampaging Horde:** A clan of ratfolk has unleashed a massive horde of Doom Flayers upon the unsuspecting underground settlements. The vehicles surge through the tunnels, leaving destruction in their wake. The adventurers must rally the disparate factions of the underground world to mount a desperate defense against the Doom Flayer horde.|
|  2  |**The Arcane Race:** A powerful and eccentric artificer has issued a challenge to ratfolk engineers and sorcerers from all clans, inviting them to participate in an deadly race where they must pilot Doom Flayers to claim a legendary prize. The adventurers are drawn into this competition, facing off against other participants in a perilous race through treacherous tunnels and ruins. |
|  3 | **Rapid Fire Crime:** The city has been plagued by notorious ratfolk outlaws using stolen ratling guns to go on a wild crime spree. As the city guard struggles to apprehend the swift and elusive outlaws, the adventurers are called upon to track down and capture the rogue ratfolk. |
|  4  |**Underground Arms Race:** A new threat has emerged in the underground world - a rogue faction of ratfolk armed with highly advanced, mechanized ratling guns. These ambitious ratfolk are looking to sell their services to other wicked underground factions, which the adventurers must prevent before the balance of power is irrevocably altered. |


### Doom Flayer Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a Doom Flayer. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Armour-Shredding Blades.** When a creature is rammed by the doom flayer and fails the saving throw against the effect, any armor the creature is wearing is damaged and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. A creature can remove the -1 penalty from the armor over an hour if it has the appropriate tools and proficiency with them (blacksmith tools or leatherworker's tools, depending on the armor).

**Black Hole Reactor.** A crew member at the doom flayer's helm can use their action to activate its Black Hole Reactor. If they do so, they can use half of their movement to immediately exit the doom flayer, allowing the doom flayer to move in a straight line up to its movement speed after they do so. At the start of the creature's next turn, the doom flayer is destroyed, and each creature within 15 feet must make a DC Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, creatures take 9 (2d8) force damage for every 10 feet the doom flayer moved in a straight line during the last round. If this damage reduces the target to 20 hit points or fewer and they failed the saving throw, they are banished to another plane of existence at the DM's choice.

**Repelling Knife-Blades.** At the end of a crew member's turn, if the doom flayer moved 20 feet or more that turn, ranged attacks against the doom flayer and its crew have disadvantage until the start of that crew member's next turn.



\pagebreakNum

### Doom Flayer Tactics

Doom flayers function as hard-hitting chariots for ratfolk armies, lingering along enemy flanks until they identify a vulnerable target, then charging in to slice up their victims. Their ratfolk drivers typically use the Scurry Away trait to avoid counterattacks, driving to a safe distance before returning for another charge.

#### Doom Flayer Upgrade Tactics

&emsp;**Armour-Shredding Blades.** Pilots of doom flayers with this upgrade will specifically target armored enemies.

**Black Hole Reactor.** If the battle isn't going in the ratfolk's favor, it can activate the Black Hole Reactor as a last-ditch gambit. Note that even on the turn the ratfolk abandons the vehicle, the unmanned vehicle can still be used to crash into a target as it drives in a straight line toward its destination before detonating.

**Repelling Knife-Blades.** With this upgrade, the doom flayer's driver no longer needs to fear the repercussions of entering within range of heavy ranged fire. This makes the doom flayer perfect for harassing enemies with such attacks.

### Doom Flayer Weapon Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from this vehicle are materials salvaged from its remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Two-Creature Weapon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

The Basic Weapon Loot Table should be used for the standard version of any of the two-creature weapons in this document. The Advanced Weapon Table should be used for the more powerful variant of any of the weapons.

# Self-Propelled Vehicles
Most land vehicles in fantasy settings are pulled by other creatures, such as wagons, carriages, or chariots. However, through some combination of technology or magic, some vehicles may be self-propelled and driven by a passenger. These may be relatively small mechanical contraptions, magically self-propelled carriages, or mighty war machines rumbling across blasted battlefields. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these vehicle types in your games. They can be applied to vehicles of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own vehicles. The rules here can be applied to most self-powered vehicles piloted by a passenger. 

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Rules
Self-propelled vehicles are vehicles able to move without needing to be pushed or pulled by another creature, and they usually don’t need an external energy source (such as wind). Throughout this document, they will be referred to simply as vehicles. Creatures within a vehicle are referred to as passengers. 
In combat, vehicles use most of the same rules as creatures, with the following additional considerations:

### Opportunity Attacks
Vehicles provoke opportunity attacks as usual. When a vehicle provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle itself or any creature riding on or inside it, provided they are within reach and do not have total cover.

### Spacing Within Vehicles
All creatures within a vehicle count as being within 5 feet of each other.

### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Entering or exiting the vehicle costs a creature half of its movement. Each creature inside the vehicle may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting.

### Crashing into Creatures and Objects
A vehicle can crash into a creature or object by entering its space. When it does, the creature or object must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice) using the vehicle's DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved in a straight line before attempting to enter the target's space (maximum 20d6 damage).

If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage and is not knocked prone. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the vehicle's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. A target can only make this saving throw once per turn.

If the vehicle is at least two size categories larger than the target it crashed into, it can continue moving through the target's space if it has any movement remaining. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop. If the target is an impassable object that could reasonably damage the vehicle, such as an iron wall, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6 damage). Each creature on or inside the vehicle takes the damage as well

### Prone Vehicles
If vehicle falls prone, it cannot right itself and is incapacitated until it is flipped upright.

### Falling Vehicles
When a vehicle falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position. If the vehicle falls due to the actions of its driver (such as jumping off a ramp) it may not land prone (DM’s discretion) but still takes fall damage.



### Repairing Vehicles
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
Certain circumstances can cause a vehicle to malfunction and eventually break down due to wear and tear. This wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion rules, as described in Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with the following modifications:

* When a vehicle reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
* The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a vehicle is through repair. This can be done using the rules described in the Repairing Vehicles section above. If the attempt to repair the vehicle succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle's exhaustion level remains unchanged, but the repair attempt can be made again using the same tools and replacement parts.


\pagebreakNum

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these vehicles have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A vehicle's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a vehicle's hit points reach 0, it becomes inoperative and is irreparably damaged.
### Damage Threshold
Most vehicles possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A vehicle with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the vehicle takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the vehicle's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the vehicle's hit points.
### Mishap Threshold
When a vehicle sustains damage from a single source that is equal to or exceeds its mishap threshold, it is required to roll on the Mishaps table (refer to the Mishaps section).
### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the vehicle comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the vehicle.
### Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity indicates the maximum weight of cargo the vehicle can carry.
### Vehicle DC 
Whenever the vehicle requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.
### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.
### Ability Scores 
A vehicle possesses the standard six ability scores that creatures have, along with their corresponding modifiers. The Strength of the vehicle is determined by its size and weight, while Dexterity represents its handling and maneuverability. The Constitution of a vehicle reflects its durability and quality of construction. In most cases, vehicles have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a vehicle has a score of 0 in a particular ability score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that relies on that score.

### Action Stations
A vehicle may have one or more Action Stations. Each of these stations requires a certain number of creatures to operate and may grant those creatures some amount of cover. The creatures operating these stations must be passengers within the vehicle, but not all passengers need to be operating a station. A creature operating a station can use an action to activate the station's effect. A station can be occupied by only one creature at a time and can only be activated once per round. 

#### The Helm 
Most vehicles that must be piloted by a passenger (referred to as the driver) have an Action Station known as the Helm, where the vehicle's movement is controlled. It usually consists of a chair equipped with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. If a vehicle has a helm with no one operating it, it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver who is proficient with land vehicles can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

The driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring it to a complete stop. While the vehicle is in motion, the driver can steer it along any desired course. If the driver becomes incapacitated, leaves the helm, or takes no action to alter the vehicle's course and speed, the vehicle will continue moving in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it collides with an obstacle large enough to stop its movement.


### Mishaps
Most vehicles have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways its functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishaps Table. 

To resolve a Mishap, a creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (refer to the Mishaps section). If the vehicle is moving, the check is made with disadvantage. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for the repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.
