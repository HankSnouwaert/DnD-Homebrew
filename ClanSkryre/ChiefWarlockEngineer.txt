## Forbidden Devices

Ratfolk warlock engineers possess a unique arsenal of magic items specifically designed for use against their adversaries. The chief warlock engineer can select 4 devices from the list below. He can choose the same device more than once. Each device requires an action to use and can't be used again until the warlock has had time to rebuild it using Smith's Tools during a long rest.


### Brass Orb
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If the ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can throw the device at a point it can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 15 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) force damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When the ratfolk attempts to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the ratfolk this way, it drops the brass orb, which detonates at its location.

#### Brass Orb: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Force<br>
**New Legendary Action:** A target creature within 120 feet of the ratfolk that the ratfolk can see must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is teleported to an unoccupied space of the ratfolk's choice that it can see within 20 feet of the target. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

\columnbreak

### Doom Rocket
When launched, this missile shrieks through the air before striking the ground and unleashing a wave of bright, glowing green light that irradiates anything near the impact site.

The ratfolk cannot use this device if it is restrained or grappled. When the ratfolk uses the Doom Rocket, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and launches it at a point it can see within 120 feet. The rocket detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage plus an additional 5 (1d10) radiant damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the ratfolk attempts to launch the rocket, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits the ratfolk in this way, the rocket misfires and detonates at its location.



#### Doom Rocket: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Radiant<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage, and if the target is a creature, it becomes irradiated for the next minute. At the end of the irradiated creature's turn, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, both it and each creature within 10 feet of it take 9 (2d8) radiant damage; on a successful save, the irradiated effect ends. A *lesser restoration spell* will remove the radiation.

### Earth Render

This mechanized spike jackhammers into the ground, creating a localized earthquake capable of reducing the structures of surface dwellers into rubble.

When the ratfolk uses the Earth Render, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and rams the device into the ground, creating violent tremors. Each creature in a 25-foot cube originating from the ratfolk must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. Structures in the area take double damage from the effect.

#### Earth Render: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Thunder<br>
**New Legendary Action:** A creature of the ratfolk's choice standing on earth or stone within 60 feet of the ratfolk must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature becomes restrained. Any creature, including the buried creature, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 19 Strength check. If the creature attempting the rescue has a burrow speed, it has advantage on this check.

### Warp Lighting Generator
This strange metallic device hums with power before emitting a tremendous bolt of green lightning.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Lightning Generator, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and hurls a magical green lightning bolt at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its reaction.
 
#### Warp Lighting Generator: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Lightning<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage, and if the target is a creature, it becomes charged with warp electricity. At the end of the charged creature's next turn, the electricity deals 18 (4d8) lightning damage, after which the warp electricity dissipates. Another creature that touches the charged creature can choose to take the lightning damage immediately, thereby ending the effect.
 
### Warp Fume Sprayer
This device's canister contains toxic gases that can be expelled in a wave through a large, rusty nozzle. 

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Fume Sprayer, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and sprays toxic fumes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage plus an additional 5 (1d8) poison damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become poisoned until the start of the ratfolk's next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.
 
\columnbreak 


 


#### Warp Fume Sprayer: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Poison<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere at a point within 60 feet of itself, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

### Warp Scorcher
This arm-mounted flamethrower spews lines of flames that cling to anything in their path.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Scorcher, it expends all its eldritch energy levels to unleash a gout of flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in the direction of its choice. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) fire damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be set on fire. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't set on fire. A creature that's been set on fire this way takes 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse the fire.

#### Warp Scorcher: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Fire<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) fire damage, and if the target is a creature, it is set on fire. Until a creature uses an action to douse the fire, the burning creature takes 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

### Epic Chief Warlock Engineer Battle

If you wish to make the chief warlock into an endgame threat, you can have him start the encounter piloting a wheelz of doom crewed with an irradiated rat tide and give him the following trait; this increases the CR of the encounter to CR 23: <br>


***Devious Master Driver.*** The ratfolk can pilot vehicles even while affected by its Scurry Away feature (this doesn't allow the vehicle to be piloted multiple times in a round). When the ratfolk uses its Scurry Away feature, it can have the vehicle it's piloting move up to 15 feet away rather than flee on foot.

Additionally, when the ratfolk pilots a vehicle, it can expend any number of eldritch power levels to increase the speed of the vehicle by 10 feet per power level expended until the end of the turn.

Finally, the ratfolk can't be moved or teleported from a vehicle it's piloting against its will, and when the ratfolk would take damage, it can choose to have the vehicle take the damage instead.

### Power Conduits
If the chief warlock engineer is fighting in his lair, you can increase the challenge of the encounter by giving him access to power conduits built to charge his powers. Each power conduit is a large magical object with 60 hit points, resistance to all damage, and an AC of 19. You can place one or more of these power conduits throughout the lair, and each power conduit added increases the chief warlock engineer's Challenge Rating by 1.

At the end of the chief engineer's turn, he can choose to start drawing power from the nearest conduit, creating a beam between him and the conduit; the chief engineer can do this even if he is incapacitated. While the beam is active, the conduit loses all resistances. The beam will break if the chief engineer moves more than 100 feet away from it, if he has total cover from the conduit, or if either the chief engineer or the conduit is reduced to 0 hit points. Any creature or object that moves through the beam can also break it, but it takes 22 (5d8) lightning damage as a result.

If the chief engineer starts his next turn with the beam still intact, the beam dissipates, and he may choose to either roll an additional 2d4 when activating his Unlimited Power trait this turn or end a spell of 4th level or lower in his lair.

### Chief Warlock Engineer Tactics

The chief engineer is a cunning and technologically-driven rat with an intense desire to obliterate his foes with an impressive display of technological prowess. The strategies outlined below are crafted not only to optimize his capabilities but also to offer clear cues to opponents, allowing them to form counter strategies so they gain a sense of agency in combat.

#### Unlimited Power!
This ability transforms the battle into a race against time. The chief warlock engineer will either overpower his adversaries with immense damage or succumb to his own power surges.


#### Forbidden Devices
The chief engineer possesses four Forbidden Devices, and he is quick to employ them when faced with significant threats. If he has three or more eldritch power levels, he will activate a device every turn. Alternatively, he'll use them whenever he can target three or more enemies. However, he will always keep one device in reserve to grant him an extra Legendary Action thanks to his Forbidden Augmentation ability.

When the chief warlock engineer employs a device selected for his Forbidden Augmentation as a legendary action, he will usually activate the same device as an action on his subsequent turn. This sequence provides players with both a warning of what the device can do (in the form of the legendary action) and an escalating sense of drama leading up to the device's deployment (on the subsequent turn as an action). 

**Brass Orb and Earth Render.** The legendary actions these devices grant should be used to manipulate enemy positioning to maximize their impact when they're used as actions


**Warp Scorcher and Warp Lightning Generator.** The legendary actions of these devices can be used to bait opponents into aiding their allies, tricking them into grouping together so they can all be hit by the device's actions.

**Doom Rocket and Warp Fume Sprayer.** The legendary actions of these devices can be used to make parts of the battlefield hazardous for players, thus herding them into less advantageous positions where the device's action can be used to best effect.

#### Legendary Actions and Scurry Away
The chief warlock engineer uses standard legendary actions when he needs to escape perilous situations or when his capabilities are hampered in a way that diminishes his ability to act. Should he remain in jeopardy even after exhausting all his legendary actions, he will use Scurry Away as a last resort.


#### Epic Chief Warlock Engineer Battle

In this encounter, the chief warlock engineer's tactics align with those detailed for doom wheels. A notable advantage he has in vehicle such as the doom wheel is that his Move legendary action allows him to ram targets with the wheel. If he can't reach a target this way, he'll rely on his Forbidden Augmentation legendary actions. 

While operating the doom wheel, the chief warlock engineer refrains from deploying any Forbidden Devices as actions. Instead, he channels all his eldritch power into the vehicle, biding his time until he's amassed sufficient power.

#### Power Conduits 
While a battle with these items present doesn't drastically alter the chief warlock engineer's tactics, it does make him prioritize targets attempting to attack the conduits he's channeling.

### Chief Warlock Engineer Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk engineers is identifying what devices they're carrying still have any functional value.

In the case of the chief warlock engineer, not only will it have the highest quality items for looting, but it will likely have magic items and other valuables that can be part of a treasure hoard, including its magic weapon, *storm demon*.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. If the identifying value materials the ratfolk was carrying will likely require an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check or a check using proficiency with appropriate tools, such as Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Alchemist's Supplies.


#### Chief Warlock Engineer Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.



##### Chief  Warlock Engineer Loot Table 

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1d4(2) 500gp Item |
|  10-11 | 1d6(3) 500gp Items | 
|  12-17 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items  |  
|  18-22 | 1d4(2) 2,000gp Items  |  
|  23+ |  2d4(5) 2,000gp Items |  


#### Example Warlock Engineer Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Warlock Master Item Names
|1d4 | 500gp Item | 1,000gp Item | 2,000gp Item |

## Doom Wheels

In the sprawling laboratories of the ratfolk, technological <Br> and magical prowess intertwine in frenetic chaos. Amidst this interplay, one invention stands as a testament to the insanity and genius of the ratfolk engineers - the doom wheel.

The doom wheel is an immense vehicle that looms over the battlefield like a nightmarish mockery of a rat wheel, a testament to the raw and unbridled power the ratfolk engineers can command. An engineer, picked from the most daring (or unhinged) of their kind, steers the doom wheel from a pilot seat within, guiding this deadly contraption with mad glee, careening wildly across the landscape.

The doom wheel’s motion is powered by an army of irradiated rats, feverishly running in unison along the inside of its massive. Dangerous arcane stones built into the machine mutate and transform these rats into tireless, monstrous variants of their kin, their muscles bulging with unnatural strength and their eyes glowing an eerie green. The ceaseless running of these mutant rats drives the huge wheel, causing it to spin with a relentless, unstoppable momentum.

But the arcane stones serve a dual purpose. As the wheel spins, it generates a kind of eldritch energy, harnessed by the embedded stone. The magical mineral, imbued with the raw force of movement, channels this power into devastating blasts of arcane lightning. This energy is unleashed upon the ratfolk’s enemies in brilliant, lethal arcs, turning the doom wheel into a rolling generator of destructive force.

### Warp Flame Wheel

Instead of generating devastating arcs of lightning, this doom wheel variant channels its eldritch energy into an infernal pyrotechnic display. At the heart of the wheel, an eldritch furnace glows with an unholy intensity. Fueled by the sheer kinetic force of the running rats, the furnace channels its blazing wrath into gouts of horrifying, green-tinged flame that consumes all in its path. This fire, hotter and more potent than any natural flame, reduces enemies to ash and the battlefield to a scorched wasteland.

However, the warp flame wheel's destructive potential doesn't end there, for it is equipped with a high-pressure sprayer loaded with a sticky, highly flammable oil. At the pilot's command, this oil can be sprayed over adversaries or across the battlefield. Then, with a malicious grin, the engineer ignites the oil-soaked area with the eldritch fire, turning it into a nightmarish sea of flame.

### Wheel of Kill-Doom

When the mad ratfolk engineers set their minds to outdo themselves, they do so with a level of fanaticism that defies comprehension. Born of such fervor is the pinnacle of their insane genius, a terrifying machine imbued with unstable destructive power: The Wheel of Kill-Doom.

The Wheel of Kill-Doom represents the zenith of ratfolk engineering prowess, an evolved doom wheel that is the ultimate fusion of the most potent arcane technology and the highest-grade parts scavenged, stolen, or "ingeniously acquired” by ratfolk. The structure of the Wheel of Kill-Doom is reinforced with arcane steel designed to make it hardier and amplify the machine’s unnatural power.

Every nook and cranny of this monolithic machine boasts meticulous attention to detail, from the titanium-bolted joints to the arcane-etched gears. In a significant upgrade from the original doom wheel, the Wheel of Kill-Doom is equipped with additional lightning generators. These devices, powered by the relentless running of the strongest irradiated rats, generate lightning of a potency unseen in its predecessor. This energy coalesces into brilliant, crackling bolts that can arc between multiple foes, leaving a trail of charred bodies and scorched earth. The spectacle of the Wheel of Kill-Doom in action is nothing short of a storm let loose on the battlefield.

### Doom Wheel Loot
Because doom wheels are vehicles, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are items they were carrying or materials salvaged from their remains. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks or may not require a check to spot at all. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Doom Wheel Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Doom Wheel Tactics

Due to the doom wheel's erratic nature and propensity for malfunctioning, its tactics are limited. However, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind:

* The lightning generated by the doom wheel strikes the closest target that is not inside the wheel. This means it must have a clear path to its intended target, avoiding any allies if present, and should strive to end its movement as close as possible to the target.
* The rats inside the wheel will continue turning it even if the driver dies, causing the wheel to keep moving in its current direction.

#### Warp Flame Wheel Tactics
* The warp flame wheel’s pilot always begins by using Vermin Grease to accelerate the wheel to maximum ramming speed and extend the range of its flamethrower. 
* The pilot may prioritize setting the grease on fire or hitting as many targets as possible with the flamethrower. A helpful rule of thumb is to count setting the grease on fire as equivalent to hitting two targets with the flamethrower. 
* The Flame Siphon ability can help sustain the rats in the Treadmill. If the rats' speed decreases due to being at half health or lower, focus on passing the wheel through the fire until they regain enough health to increase their speed, even if it means temporarily reducing your damage output.

#### Wheel of Kill-Doom Tactics
* The tactics remain the same as the normal doom wheel, with the only new feature being that the lightning bolt it generates has the ability to jump to another target. Find two enemies close together to avoid the seconded bolt jumping to any allies.

# Self-Propelled Vehicles
Most land vehicles in fantasy settings are pulled by other creatures, such as wagons, carriages, or chariots. However, through some combination of technology or magic, some vehicles may be self-propelled and driven by a passenger. These may be relatively small mechanical contraptions, magically self-propelled carriages, or mighty war machines rumbling across blasted battlefields. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these vehicle types in your games. They can be applied to vehicles of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own vehicles. The rules here can be applied to most self-powered vehicles piloted by a passenger. 

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Rules
Self-propelled vehicles are vehicles able to move without needing to be pushed or pulled by another creature, and they usually don’t need an external energy source (such as wind). Throughout this document, they will be referred to simply as vehicles. Creatures within a vehicle are referred to as passengers. 
In combat, vehicles use most of the same rules as creatures, with the following additional considerations:

### Opportunity Attacks
Vehicles provoke opportunity attacks as usual. When a vehicle provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle itself or any creature riding on or inside it, provided they are within reach and do not have total cover.

### Spacing Within Vehicles
All creatures within a vehicle count as being within 5 feet of each other.

### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Entering or exiting the vehicle costs a creature half of its movement. Each creature inside the vehicle may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting.

### Crashing into Creatures and Objects
A vehicle can crash into a creature or object by entering its space. When it does, the creature or object must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice) using the vehicle's DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved in a straight line before attempting to enter the target's space (maximum 20d6 damage).

If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage and is not knocked prone. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the vehicle's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. A target can only make this saving throw once per turn.

If the vehicle is at least two size categories larger than the target it crashed into, it can continue moving through the target's space if it has any movement remaining. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop. If the target is an impassable object that could reasonably damage the vehicle, such as an iron wall, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6 damage). Each creature on or inside the vehicle takes the damage as well

### Prone Vehicles
If vehicle falls prone, it cannot right itself and is incapacitated until it is flipped upright.

### Falling Vehicles
When a vehicle falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position. If the vehicle falls due to the actions of its driver (such as jumping off a ramp) it may not land prone (DM’s discretion) but still takes fall damage.



### Repairing Vehicles
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
Certain circumstances can cause a vehicle to malfunction and eventually break down due to wear and tear. This wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion rules, as described in Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with the following modifications:

* When a vehicle reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
* The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a vehicle is through repair. This can be done using the rules described in the Repairing Vehicles section above. If the attempt to repair the vehicle succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle's exhaustion level remains unchanged, but the repair attempt can be made again using the same tools and replacement parts.

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these vehicles have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A vehicle's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a vehicle's hit points reach 0, it becomes inoperative and is irreparably damaged.
### Damage Threshold
Most vehicles possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A vehicle with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the vehicle takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the vehicle's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the vehicle's hit points.
### Mishap Threshold
When a vehicle sustains damage from a single source that is equal to or exceeds its mishap threshold, it is required to roll on the Mishaps table (refer to the Mishaps section).
### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the vehicle comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the vehicle.
### Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity indicates the maximum weight of cargo the vehicle can carry.
### Vehicle DC 
Whenever the vehicle requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.
### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.
### Ability Scores 
A vehicle possesses the standard six ability scores that creatures have, along with their corresponding modifiers. The Strength of the vehicle is determined by its size and weight, while Dexterity represents its handling and maneuverability. The Constitution of a vehicle reflects its durability and quality of construction. In most cases, vehicles have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a vehicle has a score of 0 in a particular ability score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that relies on that score.

### Action Stations
A vehicle may have one or more Action Stations. Each of these stations requires a certain number of creatures to operate and may grant those creatures some amount of cover. The creatures operating these stations must be passengers within the vehicle, but not all passengers need to be operating a station. A creature operating a station can use an action to activate the station's effect. A station can be occupied by only one creature at a time and can only be activated once per round. 

#### The Helm 
Most vehicles that must be piloted by a passenger (referred to as the driver) have an Action Station known as the Helm, where the vehicle's movement is controlled. It usually consists of a chair equipped with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. If a vehicle has a helm with no one operating it, it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver who is proficient with land vehicles can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

The driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring it to a complete stop. While the vehicle is in motion, the driver can steer it along any desired course. If the driver becomes incapacitated, leaves the helm, or takes no action to alter the vehicle's course and speed, the vehicle will continue moving in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it collides with an obstacle large enough to stop its movement.


### Mishaps
Most vehicles have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways its functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishaps Table. 

To resolve a Mishap, a creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (refer to the Mishaps section). If the vehicle is moving, the check is made with disadvantage. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for the repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.
