Driven by a relentless desire to harness destructive power, The Chief Warlock Engineer has transcended his ratfolk origins to become a fearsome harbinger of technological annihilation.

The Chief Warlock Engineer is a figure more imposing than the typical ratfolk, standing tall and hunched, his silhouette commanding both respect and trepidation. He carries the marks of his relentless pursuit of power, with a body mutilated by weapons and experiments gone awry. His form is a blend of living flesh and cold machinery, for he has replaced missing and damaged body parts with a symphony of mechanical devices. Most notable is his mechanical clawed arm, an emblem of his relentless drive for dominance over both arcane and mechanical forces. Upon his back, he bears whirring devices that are forever channeling eldritch power, a testament to his mastery of the arcane arts.

Armed with the fearsome halberd known as Storm Demon, The Chief Warlock Engineer commands the very elements to his will. With a single swing, this weapon can discharge blasts of lightning, leaving destruction in its wake. His arsenal is further augmented by an array of terrible devices, each capable of unleashing devastation upon his enemies. Whether shooting torrents of fire or lightning, launching rockets that scream through the air, deploying poison gas clouds that choke his foes, or even tearing holes in the fabric of reality itself, his arsenal knows no bounds. He possesses an uncanny ability to enhance these devices beyond the capabilities of a typical warlock engineer. In dire circumstances, he might pilot a doom wheel, or strategically deploy Power Conduits before a battle to replenish his arcane energy, ensuring a relentless onslaught.

## Forbidden Devices

Ratfolk warlock engineers possess a unique arsenal of magic items specifically designed for use against their adversaries. The chief warlock engineer can select 4 devices from the list below. He can choose the same device more than once. Each device requires an action to use and can't be used again until the warlock has had time to rebuild it using Smith's Tools during a long rest.


### Brass Orb
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If the ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can throw the device at a point it can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 15 feet of it thatâ€™s not behind total cover must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) force damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When the ratfolk attempts to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the ratfolk this way, it drops the brass orb, which detonates at its location.

#### Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Force<br>
**New Legendary Action:** A target creature within 120 feet of the ratfolk that the ratfolk can see must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is teleported to an unoccupied space of the ratfolk's choice that it can see within 20 feet of the target. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

\columnbreak

### Doom Rocket
When launched, this missile shrieks through the air before striking the ground and unleashing a wave of bright, glowing green light that irradiates anything near the impact site.

The ratfolk cannot use this device if it is restrained or grappled. When the ratfolk uses the Doom Rocket, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and launches it at a point it can see within 120 feet. The rocket detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage plus an additional 5 (1d10) radiant damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the ratfolk attempts to launch the rocket, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits the ratfolk in this way, the rocket misfires and detonates at its location.



#### Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Radiant<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage, and if the target is a creature, it becomes irradiated for the next minute. At the end of the irradiated creature's turn, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, both it and each creature within 10 feet of it take 9 (2d8) radiant damage; on a successful save, the irradiated effect ends. A *lesser restoration spell* will remove the radiation.

### Earth Render

This mechanized spike jackhammers into the ground, creating a localized earthquake capable of reducing the structures of surface dwellers into rubble.

When the ratfolk uses the Earth Render, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and rams the device into the ground, creating violent tremors. Each creature in a 25-foot cube originating from the ratfolk must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone. Structures in the area take double damage from the effect.

#### Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Thunder<br>
**New Legendary Action:** A creature of the ratfolk's choice standing on earth or stone within 60 feet of the ratfolk must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature becomes restrained. Any creature, including the buried creature, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 19 Strength check. If the creature attempting the rescue has a burrow speed, it has advantage on this check.

### Warp Lighting Generator
This strange metallic device hums with power before emitting a tremendous bolt of green lightning.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Lightning Generator, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and hurls a magical green lightning bolt at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its reaction.
 
#### Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Lightning<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage, and if the target is a creature, it becomes charged with warp electricity. At the end of the charged creature's next turn, the electricity deals 18 (4d8) lightning damage, after which the warp electricity dissipates. Another creature that touches the charged creature can choose to take the lightning damage immediately, thereby ending the effect.
 
### Warp Fume Sprayer
This device's canister contains toxic gases that can be expelled in a wave through a large, rusty nozzle. 

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Fume Sprayer, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and sprays toxic fumes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage plus an additional 5 (1d8) poison damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become poisoned until the start of the ratfolk's next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.
 
\columnbreak 


 


#### Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Poison<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere at a point within 60 feet of itself, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

### Warp Scorcher
This arm-mounted flamethrower spews lines of flames that cling to anything in their path.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Scorcher, it expends all its eldritch energy levels to unleash a gout of flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in the direction of its choice. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) fire damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be set on fire. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't set on fire. A creature that's been set on fire this way takes 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse the fire.

#### Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Fire<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) fire damage, and if the target is a creature, it is set on fire. Until a creature uses an action to douse the fire, the burning creature takes 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

### Epic Chief Warlock Engineer Battle

If you wish to make the chief warlock into an endgame threat, you can have him start the encounter piloting a wheelz of doom crewed with an irradiated rat tide and give him the following trait; this increases the CR of the encounter to CR 23: <br>


***Devious Master Driver.*** The ratfolk can pilot vehicles even while affected by its Scurry Away feature (this doesn't allow the vehicle to be piloted multiple times in a round). When the ratfolk uses its Scurry Away feature, it can have the vehicle it's piloting move up to 15 feet away rather than flee on foot.

Additionally, when the ratfolk pilots a vehicle, it can expend any number of eldritch power levels to increase the speed of the vehicle by 10 feet per power level expended until the end of the turn.

Finally, the ratfolk can't be moved or teleported from a vehicle it's piloting against its will, and when the ratfolk would take damage, it can choose to have the vehicle take the damage instead.

### Power Conduits

If the chief warlock engineer is fighting in its lair, you can increase the challenge of the encounter by giving it access to power conduits built to charge the ratfolk's powers. Each power conduit is a large magical object with 60 hit points, resistance to all damage, and an AC of 19. You can place one or more of these power conduits throughout the lair, and each power conduit added increases the chief warlock engineer's Challenge Rating by 1.

At the end of ratfolk's turn, it can choose to start drawing power from the nearest conduit, creating a beam between it and the conduit; the ratfolk can do this even if it is incapacitated. While the beam is active, the conduit loses all resistances. The beam will break if the ratfolk moves more than 100 feet away from it, if it has total cover from the conduit, or if either the ratfolk or the conduit is reduced to 0 hit points. 

**Note: This pair of sentences is confusing** *Any creature or object that breaks the beam by providing cover between the ratfolk and the conduit takes 22 (5d8) lightning damage. A creature that moves through the beam can choose to take the damage to end the beam as well.*

If the ratfolk starts its next turn with the beam still intact, the beam dissipates, and the ratfolk may choose to either roll an additional 2d4 when activating its Unlimited Power trait this turn or end a spell of 4th level or lower in its lair.

### Chief Warlock Engineer Tactics

The chief engineer is a cunning and technologically-driven rat with an intense desire to obliterate his foes with an impressive display of technological prowess. The strategies outlined below are crafted not only to optimize his capabilities but also to offer clear cues to opponents, allowing them to form counter strategies so they gain a sense of agency in combat.

**Unlimited Power!**
This ability transforms the battle into a race against time. The chief warlock engineer will either overpower his adversaries with immense damage or succumb to his own power surges.


**Forbidden Devices**
The chief engineer possesses four Forbidden Devices, and he is quick to employ them when faced with significant threats. If he has three or more eldritch power levels, he will activate a device every turn. Alternatively, he'll use them whenever he can target three or more enemies. However, he will always keep one device in reserve to grant him an extra Legendary Action thanks to his **Forbidden Augmentation** ability.

When the chief warlock engineer employs a device selected for his Forbidden Augmentation as a legendary action, he will usually activate the same device as an action on his subsequent turn. This sequence provides players with both a warning of what the device can do (in the form of the legendary action) and an escalating sense of drama leading up to the device's deployment (on the subsequent turn as an action). 

Brass Orb and Earth Render: The legendary actions these devices grant should be used to manipulate enemy positioning to maximize their impact when they're used as actions

Warp Scorcher and Warp Lightning Generator: The legendary actions of these devices can be used to bait opponents into aiding their allies, tricking them into grouping together so they can all be hit by the device's actions.

Doom Rocket and Warp Fume Sprayer: The legendary actions of these devices can be used to make parts of the battlefield hazardous for players, thus herding them into less advantageous positions where the device's action can be used to best effect.

**Legendary Actions and Scurry Away**
The chief warlock engineer uses standard legendary actions when he needs to escape perilous situations or when his capabilities are hampered in a way that diminishes his ability to act. Should he remain in jeopardy even after exhausting all his legendary actions, he will use **Scurry Away** as a last resort.

Epic Chief Warlock Engineer Battle

In this encounter, the chief warlock engineer's tactics align with those detailed for doom wheels. A notable advantage he has in vehicle such as the doom wheel is that his Move legendary action allows him to ram targets with the wheel. If he can't reach a target this way, he'll rely on his **Forbidden Augmentation** legendary actions. 

While operating the doom wheel, the chief warlock engineer refrains from deploying any Forbidden Devices as actions. Instead, he channels all his eldritch power into the vehicle, biding his time until he's amassed sufficient power.

**Power Conduits** 
While a battle with these items present doesn't drastically alter the chief warlock engineer's tactics, it does make him prioritize targets attempting to attack the conduits he's channeling.

### Chief Warlock Engineer Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk engineers is identifying what devices they're carrying still have any functional value.

In the case of the chief warlock engineer, not only will it have the highest quality items for looting, but it will likely have magic items and other valuables that can be part of a treasure hoard, including its magic weapon, *storm demon*.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. If the identifying value materials the ratfolk was carrying will likely require an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check or a check using proficiency with appropriate tools, such as Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Alchemist's Supplies.


#### Chief Warlock Engineer Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.


##### Chief  Warlock Engineer Loot Table 

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1d4(2) 500gp Item |
|  10-11 | 1d6(3) 500gp Items |

|  18-22 | 1d4(2) 2,000gp Items  |  
|  23+ |  2d4(5) 2,000gp Items |  


#### Example Warlock Engineer Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Warlock Master Item Names
