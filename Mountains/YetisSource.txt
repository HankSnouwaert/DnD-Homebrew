## Yetis
These elusive creatures roam the remote <br> mountain ranges of the world. They are mysterious <br> creatures who can rarely be found if they don’t want <br> to be and are often the focus of many legends and folk tales amongst mountain folk. Over time, these stories often distort and over-simplify the true nature of yetis, and few truly understand them

***Many Varients.***
There are many kinds of yeti, with the most common yetis being a violent variant that often comes into conflict with travelers and mountain villages. This has led to a perception that all yetis are simplistic, brutish, and bestial mountain creatures. However, there is more nuance to yetis. They are a link between beast and human, and different types of yetis represent these aspects in different ways. 

***The Wild Men.***
Many temples, sacred monasteries, and druidic circles within the high peaks hold yetis up as a source of both fear and respect. Mountain myths speak of yetis existing in a realm between beast and humanoid, not truly belonging to either. Some mountain clerics tell tales of yeti ancestors who once walked the world alongside other humanoid races but retreated deep into the mountains as civilization developed. Others believe yetis are reincarnated druids who have lost sight of the boundary between man and beast, consigning themselves to roam the mountains in a state between worlds.

***Common Characteristics.*** 
Though they come in many varieties, all yetis share much in common. They all appear to be nearly humanoid primates who walk upright with loping strides. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, and their long limbs allow them to stride through snow and climb mountainous terrain with ease. These long limbs also lend themselves to grappling foes, and many yetis will even fling enemies off ledges in combat.

Many have a small pair of horns, and most have white coats to blend into their alpine homes. Combined with their silent, fluid movement, yetis are nearly impossible to spot in the mountains, especially in obscuring weather. For this reason, yetis will rarely attack unless they are able to catch their enemies off-guard and prefer attacking during blizzards.

Yetis also possess an innate connection to their icey homes which manifests itself in an instinctive form of ice magic. Different yetis manifest this in different ways, with some possessing an icey grasp, others able to freeze with a stare, and some even emitting a chilling aura.

### Dzu-Teh 
Dzu-teh are brown-furred, long-limbed yetis that walk primarily on their knuckles and stalk highland forests where their bodies blend with the trees. They are the most brutal of yeti-kind, combining the humanoid cunning and capacity for cruelty with the ruthless instincts and savagery of a predatory beast. Dzu-teh stalk their mountainous domain, leaving terror and bloodshed in their wake. The only evidence of their presence is the chilling high-pitched wails that echo through the night and the frozen remains left behind after their attacks.

***Murderous Predators.*** In combat, dzu-teh employ icicle-tipped claws and massive teeth to rip apart their prey. They can also manipulate the air temperature around them, causing it to drop so rapidly their victims freeze in place. However, they are at their most terrifying when they are able to unleash a flurry of claws upon a grappled creature, leaving behind nothing but gore and blood-stained slush on the mountainside. 

***Destroyers of Harmony.*** Dzu-teh kill anything they come across during their wanderings through the mountains, sparing only other lesser yetis who follow them out of fear. The only yetis that directly oppose the dzu-teh are the Meh-Teh, who despise these creatures, seeing them as the embodiment of the vilest aspects of both man and beast. It is said that Meh-Teh and dzu-teh engage in secret wars at the highest peaks of the mountains, their battles echoing through the desolate slopes in the dead of night.

### Meh-Teh
Meh-teh are the most elusive of all yetis. Known as protectors of the mountains, they are highly respected by those who inhabit their territories. The meh-teh prioritize balance and peace within their realm above all else. When peace is disrupted or chaos ensues, the meh-teh becomes a deadly force, determined to sweep away those responsible.

***Drawn to Enlightenment.*** Meh-teh are solitary creatures, avoiding contact with “civilized” beings. However, many monks believe that the meh-teh may appear before those who seek spiritual enlightenment deep within the mountains. If the individual possesses an honest soul, the meh-teh may even provide them shelter and sustenance, allowing the traveler to focus on their spiritual journey in peace and solitude. Some monasteries have a Meh-The patron that provides food and other gifts. In rare cases, the meh-teh may join the monastery and become a spiritual leader. However, monasteries with a meh-teh resident are weary of outsiders and often forbid their entry.

***Guardian of Nature and Civilization.*** Meh-teh are thought to embody a spiritual blend of man and animal, and they believe in the harmonious coexistence of civilization and the wilds. Villages and monasteries within their realms are careful not to expand their boundaries or disrupt the natural landscape. They may make offerings and hold religious ceremonies to express gratitude to the natural world and the meh-teh.

Similarly, many predatory animals refrain from preying on livestock or villagers within these realms. If anyone disrupts this harmony, a piercing howl echoes through the mountains as a warning, and if the disrupters fail to heed it, they are soon met by the furious vengeance the meh-teh.

### Yeti Stalkers

Among what is regarded as the common variant of yeti are rare yeti individuals who possess even greater ferocity and icey magical traits. Known as yeti stalkers, or by some northern tribes as the “frozen nightmare,” they earned their titles by their ruthless hunting techniques. They actively stalk, ambush, and slaughter outsiders within their realm. These yetis possess an insatiable appetite beyond the rest of their kin and are constantly driven to find prey as they attempt to appease their neverending hunger.

***Enhanced Ice Magic.*** The bodies of yeti stalkers exude an eerie freezing aura that can cause instant hypothermia to any ill-prepared adventurer. This freezing aura not only serves as their primary defense but also as a weapon. They can imbue this chilling energy into objects, creating frost weapons capable of freezing and shattering their enemies in one fell swoop. These weapons are fashioned from large branches and end in magical ice formations, making them highly effective clubs. However, these ice-enchanted weapons carry with them the risk of being melted if they are exposed to fire or extreme heat.

***The Call to War.*** So great is their bloodlust that some warmongering tribes can summon them from their mountain homes when bloody battles are imminent. The yeti stalkers come howling down the mountains en masse to seize their opportunity for bountiful slaughter. They fight alongside their temporary allies, using their speed and frozen ferocity to rip through foes so they may enjoy the banquet of enemy corpses left behind afterward. How long these alliances last will depend on their allies' skill in keeping the yetis at bay while providing them with plentiful opportunities for bloodshed.

### Teh-Lma
Teh-lma are smaller yetis, standing about 4 to 5 feet tall. They inhabit lower altitudes compared to their larger counterparts and reside in areas where trees and greenery still thrive. Teh-lma primarily prey on small game and may even attack smaller isolated humanoids, such as halflings, gnomes, or goblins.

***Lower Yetis.*** Legends suggest that teh-lma represent the combined wisdom of both humanoid and wild animals, as well as the combined brutality of each. However, teh-lma are believed to have neither reached the heights of spiritual enlightenment nor the depths of barbaric cruelty as their kin. Consequently, they are shunned by both types of yeti, forcing them to dwell at lower altitudes in exile from their larger cousins. 

***Yeti Followers.*** On rare occasions, larger yetis have been observed leading small groups of teh-lma. Some speculate that this indicates teh-lma's attempt at completing their journey to enlightened redemption or total savagery. Teh-lma in the company of dzu-teh or “common yetis,” serve as ferocious packmates, aiding their kin in hunts and attacks on humanoids. Teh-lma following meh-teh act as disciples to a respected teacher from whom they seek spiritual guidance on their path to enlightenment.

|  1  | **The Curse of the Wild:** There's a local legend of a great warrior who was cursed by a shaman, and turned into a dzu-teh. He is believed to still reside within the highland forest, haunted by his past life. Local villagers have reported a rise in attacks, suggesting that the cursed warrior may be growing restless, or perhaps, seeking to break the curse. The party could be tasked with either lifting the curse or putting the warrior to rest.|
|  2  |**The Enlightened and the Savage:** The party stumbles upon a tribe of meh-teh who are preparing for a war against the dzu-teh. The party can be asked to assist, either by direct combat, spying on the dzu-teh, or gathering much-needed resources.|
|  3 | **Frostbitten Tracks:** A famous explorer has disappeared while on an expedition through the highland forests, and the only clue is a trail leading to the dzu-teh's territory. The party must follow the frostbitten tracks, confront the dzu-teh, and hopefully find the lost explorer alive.|
|  4  |**The Yeti Patron.** A secretive monk is looking for candidates to join his monastery that is protected by a meh-teh. However, the monk requires a test of spiritual strength and dedication. Can the party prove themselves worthy to join this exclusive monastery?|
|  5  |**The Meh-Teh's Domain.** A member of a nearby monastery has been lost in the mountains while seeking spiritual enlightenment. The monks suspect that he has been lost within the realm of a meh-teh, and ask the party to find him. In doing so, they must show respect for the harmony the meh-teh strives to maintain, or risk making a powerful enemy.|
|  6  | **The Yeti Shrine.** An ancient shrine dedicated to the meh-teh has been desecrated. The players come across this shrine and are attacked by the angered meh-teh. If they don’t wish to slay the yeti, they will have to restore its shrine while fending off its attacks.|
|  7  |**The Yeti Apprentice.** The party encounters a lone teh-lma seeking a master. It wishes to become stronger and has chosen the party for this purpose. They can either aid the teh-lma in its quest or try to find its original yeti group to return it.  |
|  8  | **Spiritual Trial.** The party stumbles upon a band of teh-lma following a meh-teh, who is helping them on their spiritual journey. The party is asked to assist in a rite of passage, involving a challenging task that tests both physical strength and spiritual resolve.|
|  9  |**Fury from The Peaks.** A group of teh-lma led by a dzu-teh have been causing problems in a nearby mountain pass, making it nearly impossible for travelers to traverse. The party is hired to clear the pass, which leads to the discovery of why the yetis are attacking in the first place. |

### Yeti Tactics

Yetis are ambush predators well adapted to moving through mountainous alpine terrain. They rely on surprise attacks in snowy or rocky environments. If their ambush is thwarted, they will retreat and attempt to sneak up on their targets later. Most yetis have a way of paralyzing their victims, rendering them helpless. However, a common weakness all yetis share is their fear of fire. Constant fire damage can deter a determined yeti, forcing it to retreat temporarily and target the individual responsible for the fire damage in future encounters.

**Meh-Teh.** Meh-teh are rarely provoked to anger, but when they are, it is for a righteous cause. They never give up on punishing those they deem guilty. Meh-teh initiate combat with an all-out attack, aiming to grapple their foes and drag them away from allies. On the next turn, their actions depend on whether the target is still grappled. If it is, they deliver a bite before attempting to throw the frozen victim into their allies for additional damage. If the target is not grappled, the meh-teh continues to attempt to grapple and bite the victim as they drag it further away. They may consider throwing grappled victims off a high cliff if possible.

**Teh-Lma.** Teh-lma are the weakest and most cowardly among the yetis. They exhibit animalistic behavior but seem to be ashamed of it. If they encounter heavy resistance during an attack, they may flee and not return. Teh-lma employ similar tactics to meh-teh, using an action to attempt to freeze a creature and continuing to drag the victim away as described for meh-teh.

**Dzu-Teh.** Dzu-teh differ from other yetis due to their Ravage attack. They prioritize moving their grappled targets away from allies so they can tear them apart without interruption. If overwhelmed by the allies of a grappled and prone creature, dzu-teh may choose to take the dash action and flee with their grappled target instead of risking being overwhelmed and losing their prey. However, if the target is paralyzed or the grappled target is bloodied, their predatory instincts kick in, and they unleash the Ravage attack regardless of the circumstances. Though they still use their normal movement to position themselves before executing this action.

**Yeti Stalkers.** While yeti stalkers can hunt alone, they prefer to be in groups. When attacking multiple creatures, they will attempt to circle around what they perceive as the weakest victim. This positioning allows all the yetis to subject their target and any creatures attempting to aid it to their Chilling Aura. Yetis will switch their focus to any victim that succumbs to the aura, using one of their attacks to automatically grapple the creature while the rest of the group continues to assault it. If the yetis are looking for a meal, they will each grab a frozen victim before making a retreat with their prey back up their mountain, making pursuit as difficult as possible.

### Yeti Loot
The valuable items looted from yetis will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

While yetis don't use much in the way of equipment, they may wear or keep more valuable items they’ve collected. If you’re using a yeti important to a story for a climactic battle, it is usually good to provide some high-value “art objects” from the DMG they’ve collected or crafted for players to find.

#### Yeti Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
