# Mountain Compendium

These beautiful and treacherous environments are a staple in many fantasy adventures. Mountains can serve as imposing impediments to travel as players try to pass them to reach their destination, or they can be the location of the player's goal, serving as a dangerous and dramatic setting for an adventure. Even in the heart of relatively tame and civilized lands, mountains serve as bastions of untamed and unforgiving wilderness, for there are few environments that pose as many hazards to travelers.

This document provides content to help you run games that feature mountains of any shape and size in any environment. This content ranges from character options for players who want their characters to be associated with mountains, to mechanics for running sessions with travel through mountains, to a bestiary of mountain creatures to populate the peaks in your games. Whether the players are only spending a day traveling through mountains or your entire campaign features mountains, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

## Mountain Adventure Ideas

Mountain environments make for natural adventure locales. The following adventure hooks can be used as inspiration for creating your own alpine adventures. They could either be minor side quests or part of much larger campaign-spanning adventures, and many of them can fit into various mountain environments, whether tropical, desert, or arctic.

##### Mountain Adventure Hooks

| d8  | Setup |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Lost Dwarven City:** In a sprawling mountain range filled with intricate tunnels and caverns, rumors of a lost dwarven city reach the adventurers. They're hired to find this legendary city said to hold untold riches.  |
|  2  | **Skyship Wreck**: A magical skyship has crash-landed high in treacherous mountain peaks. The adventurers are sent to recover valuable cargo, but they find survivors who warn of a strange creature that caused the crash.  |
|  3  | **Rockslide Rescue:** A vital mountain pass has been blocked by a sudden rockslide, trapping a group of miners in a nearby quarry. With time running out before their supplies dwindle, the adventurers must find a way to clear the path, all the while investigating what caused the sudden and suspicious rockslide. |

|   |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  4  | **Snowbound Village:** A remote mountain village has sent out a desperate plea for help. A terrifying beast stalks the icy wilderness, and a relentless blizzard has cut off all paths of escape. The adventurers must track the creature through the frozen landscape, unraveling a  mystery that may involve the villagers themselves. |
|  5  | **Cult of the Peak:** A dark cult has taken residence in the remote mountains, performing rituals that affect the weather and cause natural disasters. The adventurers must infiltrate the cult's hidden temple, battle fanatic followers, and thwart their apocalyptic plans. |
|  6  | **The Twilight Mountain:** Once every century, the "Twlight Mountain" becomes accessible when the full moon aligns with a particular peak. The adventurers must reach this mythical place where the borders between worlds blur, encountering fantastical creatures and navigating surreal landscapes to obtain an otherworldly treasure.  |
|  7  | **Monastery of the Winds:** High atop a series of craggy peaks lies a reclusive monastery, home to monks who control the power of the wind. A rare celestial event is approaching, and the adventurers must scale the difficult peaks to seek the monks' wisdom and assistance in preventing a looming catastrophe.  |
|  8  | **The Living Mountains:** The mountains themselves seem to come alive, with rock formations shifting and valleys changing overnight. The adventurers must find the source of this activity, discovering hidden earth elementals and an artifact that controls the very earth. |

## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Mountains
Like the creatures of the world, druids often adapt to a specific environment they consider to be their home.  Druids of this circle prefer to make their homes in mountain ranges, and they often carry very isolationist attitudes.  Some prefer to roam the lower slopes and valleys while others make their homes among sheer cliffs and on the tallest of peaks.  Regardless of their preferences, these druids act with the stubborn implacability of the mountains they protect. 



#### Mountain Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
Your mystical connection to mountains infuses you with the ability to cast some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Mountains Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 


##### Circle of Mountains Spells
| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *jump*, *thunderous smite* |
|  3rd          | *earthbind*, *spider climb* |
|  5th          | *leap slam**, *meld into stone*      | 
|  7th          | *stone shape*, *stoneskin*     |
|  9th          | *transmute rock*, *wall of stone*    |

**New spell found at end of subclass description*


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Mountain Forms
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
You can now use your Wild Shape feature to transform into unique mountain animal forms granted by this subclass, and when using your Wild Shape this way, you may use it as a bonus action. Detailed descriptions of these forms can be found in the Mountain Wild Shapes section.

When shapeshifting into these forms, you can choose to either be Small or Medium. Starting at 10th level, you can also choose to be Large. 

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Mountains Spells list and ignore their material component requirements.

You start knowing three of these forms: Big Horn, Llama, and Mountain Cat. Additional wild shape forms from this subclass become available at levels 4 and 8.

##### Mountain Wild Shape Options
| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Big Horn, Llama, Mountain Cat |
|  4th          | Ape, Mountain Goat, Bear | 
|  8th          | Yak, Condor|

#### Alpine Dweller
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
You gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed and resistance to fall damage. You also gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) checks relating to mountains and the life that inhabits them.  

Additionally, you can speak with animals who dwell in mountains as though under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made while interacting with them.

#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of Mountains feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Crag Caller
*6th Level Circle of Mountains feature* <br>
As an action, you can summon a rock formation at a location on the ground you can see within 100 feet of you that lasts for 10 minutes. This formation manifests with a diameter of 30 feet at its base, extending upwards to a peak height of 30 feet. The location where it's summoned must be sufficiently spacious on all sides to contain the formation's entire base and cannot be an area currently occupied by a Gargantuan creature or object.

If any overhead obstruction, like a ceiling, prevents the rock formation from reaching its maximum height, it halts upon contact with such resistance. The formation cannot restrain or pin creatures against other surfaces.

The summoned rock formation is considered difficult terrain for all creatures lacking a climb speed. It possesses an Armor Class of 16 and hit points equal to five times your druid level. When its hit points are reduced to zero, or its duration expires, the rock formation crumbles into dust.

If a creature is knocked prone atop the formation, you can have it tumble down to the base, causing the creature takes fall damage as though it fell the distance it tumbled.

Once you summon the rock formation, you cannot summon one again until you complete a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher.

#### Avatar of the Mountains
*10th Level Circle of Mountains feature* <br>
When you use your Wild Shape feature to transform into one of the forms granted by this subclass, you can choose one of the following enhancements while in that form:

**Abominable Form.** Your form turns snow-white and is covered in hardened ice, granting you resistance to cold damage. Additionally, once per turn while in this form, if you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature before striking it with an attack, the target takes an additional 2d8 cold damage, and you may push it up to 10 feet away from you.

**Stone Form.** Your form becomes enveloped in resilient mountain rock, enhancing your Armor Class by +2. Additionally, you gain immunity to the dazed, stunned, and petrified conditions, and any critical hit scored against you is treated as a normal hit instead.

\columnbreak

**Storm Form.** Your form crackles with the intense electricity of an alpine storm, granting you resistance to lightning damage. Additionally, as part of the action you use to Wild Shape, and as an action while in this form, you may cast the *call lightning* spell without expending a spell slot. This spell does not require concentration when cast this way and will end prematurely if your Wild Shape ends. When casting the spell this way, you may select any number of visible creatures to be unharmed by the spell.



#### One With The Peaks
*14th Level Circle of Mountains feature* <br>

You and creatures of your choice can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone created or affected by your druid spells and abilities without spending extra movement.  
 
Additionally, you and the chosen creatures can burrow through this earth and stone without disturbing the material. Creatures can't end their movement inside this material, and anyone who does is ejected to the nearest unoccupied space and stunned until the end of their next turn.

# Mountain Navigation
Mountains are among the most hazardous environments for overland travel. Unless there are established paths, they are almost entirely made up of rough terrain filled with hidden dangers. They are difficult to navigate, provide few resources, and host unpredictable weather. Travelers who venture too high will be exposed to brutally cold winds and thin air, and those who become lost risk stumbling into the lair of a mountain-dwelling monster. Still, adventurers often choose to risk mountain travel to attempt a shortcut on their journey, face foes dwelling among the peaks, or to simply challenge themselves to ascend to the roof of the world.

## Travel Activities
When the players travel long distances overland, mountains can be a significant challenge in their journey. You may modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players travel through mountains.

### Travel Pace
If the players are traveling through mountains without the aid of a relatively smooth trail, it is considered rough terrain unless they have a climb speed. This is the case even if the players are traveling down the mountain slope. If the players have to scale difficult cliff faces, you may even treat the travel as though they are climbing through difficult terrain, which would reduce their travel speed to ¼ the usual pace.

### Navigation
Mountains can be challenging to navigate, and the DMG suggests a navigation DC of around 15 for most mountain ranges. 

\columnbreak


<br><br>


If the players can climb a peak with an advantageous view of the landscape, you can give them advantage on their check. Players in low valleys or ravines will likely have disadvantage on navigation attempts if they have no landmarks to gauge their progress against.

### Foraging
Mountains tend to have little to no natural resources at higher altitudes. In the alpine zone, the foraging DC should be 20 or higher. At lower altitudes with vegetation, it is usually easier to find food and water.

### Belaying
There may be situations where the players are scaling a cliff together using ropes and climbing equipment. They may opt to use the practice of belaying up the cliff as a safety precaution. This involves one player climbing up a short distance while attached to a rope secured to a piton hammered into the mountainside below and securing a rope into the cliff face with another piton. A player below who is attached to this rope can then remove the first piton and climb to catch up with the first player while secured by the piton they just hammered into the mountain. This process repeats throughout the climb, and in this way, no one is ever climbing without being secured by a rope to a piton a short distance down.

If a player who is belaying falls while climbing, the rope their partner attached can catch their fall. If you wish to introduce the possibility of a belay not being secured properly and thus being yanked out by the force of the fall, you can have the player who secured the belay make a Dexterity (Survival) check to see how well the rope was secured. Set the DC to be 5 less than the DC required to climb the cliff. On a success, the rope holds, and the falling player is saved. On a failure, the rope wasn't secured properly, and the player continues to plummet.

## Mountain Hazards
Mountains are among the most hazardous natural environments. Extreme cold, strong wind, heavy precipitation, high altitude, and slippery ice are all common mountain hazards described in the DMG (pg. 110). Other hazards include falling debris, sudden drops, and unpredictable weather. 

### Avalanches & Rockslides
These events are triggered by small cascades of debris that knock other debris loose, starting a chain reaction that results in large waves, snow, or earth barreling down a mountainside. The speed, size, save DC imposed on creatures, and damage inflicted by these events depends on their severity and materials.
When one of these events occurs, all creatures near its path must roll intiative. The wave of debris travels its move speed twice each round, on intiative counts 10 and 0, and continues moving this way for as long as it's able. When the debris moves, any creature in its space moves along with it and falls prone before making a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes an amount of bludgeoning damage determined by the size category of the falling debris, and on a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

When the debris stops, it settles and buries any creatures in its space. A creature buried this way is blinded, restrained, and has total cover. The creature gains 1 level of exhaustion for every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig itself free as an action by making a Strength check against the DC of the event. It has advantage on this check if it has a burrow speed. On a success, the creature breaks up through the surface, ending the blinded and restrained condition on itself. A creature that fails this check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again. 

A creature that is not buried in the debris can spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature if it knows approximately where it is in the debris.

Creatures can't be buried by the debris if their size is larger than the event's Depth (see the table below). They also can't be carried along by the sliding debris if their size is two sizes larger than the Depth of the event. (Example: A Size Category 2 event can't bury a creature that's Large or larger and can't move a creature that's Huge or larger.)

#### Avalanches
These events are primarily made up of cascading snow. Their speed equals the roll of a number of d4s equal to their size category times 100ft. Regardless of their severity, their damage is always 1d10 bludgeoning damage.

#### Rock Slides
These events are primarily made up of cascading rocks, boulders, and dirt. Their speed is 3d4 times 50ft. Their damage equals the roll of a number of d10s equal to <br> their size category. 

\columnbreak



##### Avlanche & Rock Slide Sizes and DC
|      Size Category       | Hazard DC |  Size: <br> Length |  Size: <br> Width | Size: Depth | 
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:| 
|           1         |         10      |         1d12x10ft.          |         1d4x10ft.          | Small
|           2         |         15         |          (1d6+4)x30ft.          |         2d6x10ft.          | Medium
|           3         |         20         |           (1d8+2)x300ft.    |        1d10x100ft.          | Large
|           4         |         25          |        1d4/2 Miles          |         1d4x1,000ft.          | Huge
|           5         |         30         |        1d4x2 Miles         |         1d4/2 Miles          | Gargantuan



##### Isolated Debris

If there are a few rocks or boulders falling rather than an entire rock slide, have characters in its path make a Dexterity save against the Hazard DC. On a failed save, they take 2d10 bludgeoning damage per Size Category, are pushed 5 feet per Size Category, and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they dodge the rocks, take no damage, and are not pushed or knocked prone. Pass or fail, the rocks pass by or shatter, and the creatures are not moved any further.

> ##### Growing Events
> Avalanches and rockslides often start as small events that pick up speed and size as they progress. Most of the time, this won't be important to note when players encounter them. But, if you need to track the progress of the event, you can have its size category increase by 1 for every few rounds it travels and increase its stats accordingly,

### Steep Falls
Mountains are filled with cliffs and sudden drops. Most will be easily visible to players and won't need to be mentioned as they travel. However, if the players are unable to see a drop for any reason, or there is combat or some other dangerous event that risks pushing players off a drop, it may become necessary to determine its height. 
It may be convenient to brake these drops up into general sizes.

**Small Falls:** These are the most numerous drops, ranging in the 10s of feet, and many mountain encounters will feature at least one or two of these drops. You can make their height **1d10x10ft.**

**Medium Falls:** These are much more severe drops, reaching hundreds of feet. They will be more notable hazards during the players' journey. You can make their height **1d4x100ft.**

**Large Falls:** These are the largest of drops, reaching thousands of feet. Many mountains won't have any drops this extreme, and they make for dramatic highlights in the environment. You can make their height **1d8x500ft**.

You can add falls throughout the players' mountain journey when you feel it's appropriate and use the sizes that best fit the type of mountain environment they're traveling through. 

\columnbreak

#### Hidden Falls
Snow and ice can conceal sudden drops in a similar way to pit traps. Cornices are structures made of snow that hang over cliff edges, hiding where solid land ends. Creatures that step on them risk falling through and over the cliff edge. Other times, snow and thin ice will cover deep crevasses, hiding them from view until a creature falls through.
##### Spotting Falls
Rather than using passive Perception to spot hidden falls, you may opt to use the passive Survival of any characters keeping a lookout. The DC to spot the fall can be anywhere from 10 (barely hidden falls) to 30 (supernaturally hidden falls). You can pick what's appropriate for your environment or roll to determine one randomly.
##### Falling Through
If a creature doesn't spot the fall and falls through, it can make a Dexterity save to try to catch a ledge and prevent the fall. The DC of this save depends on the nature of the fall. A relatively narrow crag may only have a DC 10. A large cornice stretching out from a ledge covered in cursed ice may have a DC 30. This save DC can be independent of the DC to spot the fall, and you can pick one you feel is appropriate to the situation or roll to determine it randomly.

If a creature fails to grab a ledge, it falls the full length of the cliff or crevasse.

### Weather
Mountain weather is more unpredictable, changeable, and extreme than in the lowlands. This is particularly true in the higher alpine zones.
As the players travel through mountainous areas, you can roll on the following tables at each time of day to determine the wind and precipitation levels. The afternoon tends to have the most extreme weather variance and has its own tables.



##### Weather

|           17-20     |         Heavy Rain/Snow With Lightning          |



> ##### Mountain Temperature
> Mountains have extreme temperature drops between night and day when there are clear skies, partly because the sun's rays are more intense at higher altitudes. The average temperature also drops by about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 ft. of elevation gain (about 18-19 degrees per mile). There's no exact science to determining the temperature at any given time, but you can keep these factors in mind when determining the level of cold the players are facing.


#### Fog
Fog can be heavy or light. You can roll a d6 to determine the type of fog. On a roll of 1-4, it’s light fog, and on a roll of 5-6, it’s heavy fog. 

Light fog lightly obscures terrain and imposes disadvantage on checks that rely on sight. Heavy fog completely obscures terrain and makes checks that rely on sight impossible. 

Cliffs and crevasses that would have been obvious can become hidden falls in any type of fog (see the Hidden Falls section).

If there are heavy or violent winds present, the fog will be less likely to stay in the area for long and may pass more quickly.

\pagebreakNum

#### Lightning
Storms are especially dangerous in mountainous environments where the odds of being struck by lightning are significantly higher. When a storm approaches the players' location, and you wish to add the possibility of them being struck by lightning, you can roll periodically to determine if there will be a lightning strike at their location.

Periodically roll 1d20 to determine if there will be a lightning strike in the area. Rolling this way keeps the threat of lightning unpredictable. How often you make this check depends on how often you want lightning to threaten the players. Below are some suggested frequencies.

**Sparse Lightning:** Roll Every 30 Minutes<br>
&emsp;**Frequent Lightning:** Roll Every 10 Minutes<br>
&emsp;**Dense Lightning:** Roll Every 1 Minute



The result of your roll determines whether there is a lightning strike. You can determine what result is needed based on how much of the storm is centered on the players' location. Below are some suggested ranges.

| Proximity of Storm  | Result Needed for Lighting to Strike In Area |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Distant  | 16+ |
|  Nearby  | 11+ |
|  Centered on Players  | 6+ |



\columnbreak

If the lightning is striking in their proximity, each player rolls a d20, and you roll a d20 for each NPC creature. Creatures who roll low enough based on their size are potential targets for lightning. Creatures wearing metal, wielding large metal objects, or in bodies of water have disadvantage on this roll. Creatures who are prone and not in bodies of water have advantage. 

You can use the table below to determine who is a target for the lightning strike.

##### Lighting Strike Check Table
| Creature Size  | Result Needed to Be Struck |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Tiny  | 1 |
|  Small  | 5 or Less |
|  Medium  | 10 or Less |
|  Large  | 14 or Less |
|  Huge  | 17 or Less |
|  Gargantuan  | 19 or Less |


If multiple creatures roll low enough to be struck, the tallest creature among them is struck. This height includes standing on an elevated surface.

If no creature rolls the result needed to be struck, the lightning strikes a surface nearby in a flash of light accompanied by a resounding boom, warning everyone of the near miss they just had.

If a creature is struck by lightning, it takes 3d10 lightning damage, and each creature in a 15-foot cube centered on the struck creature is subjected to the effects of the *thunderwave* spell (DC 15).

#### Rain, Snow, or Hail 
Heavy precipitation, such as rain and snow, is described on page 110 of the DMG. However, hail storms are also more likely in mountainous environments, and if you wish to add them as a possible hazard, you can use the following mechanics to represent them.

##### Hail

Each creature out in the open of a hail storm at the start of its turn must make Constitution save. Creatures not wearing armor have disadvantage on this save, and creatures wearing heavy armor have advantage. A creature takes an amount of bludgeoning and cold damage determined by the size of the hail on a failed save, and half as much damage on a success.

You can have hail storms appear when you feel it fits the game or roll for them to randomly replace other types of precipitation 1/6th of the time.

#### Winds
Rules for strong winds are described on page 110 of the DMG. If you wish to make your winds particularly hazardous, you can modify them in the following ways; the save DCs and severity of the effects these winds have are determined by the Wind Severity table.

##### Extreme Cold
This wind carries a chill that cuts to the core. <Br> For every 1 minute a creature without cold resistance <Br> spends in the wind, it must make a Constitution save. On a failure, the creature takes an amount of cold damage dependent on the severity of the cold, and on a pass, it takes half as much damage. Creatures with insulating fur or clothing have advantage on this save.

##### Sudden Gusts
This wind will unexpectedly pick up gusts capable of bowling over creatures. At the start of every round of combat with this wind, roll 1d6. On a result of 5 or 6, all creatures not behind at least half cover are subjected to the effects of the *gust of wind* spell, except the distance they are moved on a failed save is dependent on the severity of the wind. 

If the players aren't in combat, this wind will greatly hamper travel for those not behind cover and make traveling near ledges very dangerous. If players are traveling for an extended period of time through an open area subjected to sudden gusts, have each of them make a Strength save for each hour of travel. On a success, they are able to push through the winds, and on a failure, they treat the terrain areas as though it's rough terrain while they struggle to fight against the winds. If the terrain is already rough terrain, creatures can only move through it at 1/4th the speed. 

##### Wind Severity
|      Wind Severity      | Wind Save DC |  Cold Damage |  Gust Push Distance |

## Example Random Encounter Tables
The following are different mountain environments across varying levels of gameplay, complete with random encounter tables you can use when the players are traversing them.  You can plug these right into your games, modify them to better suit your campaign, or simply use them as inspiration for creating and running your own river encounters.

Each mountain range has a DC determining its foraging difficulty and an activity level suggesting how often to roll for a random encounter.  Creature names with asterisks have new stat blocks listed at the end of the document. There is also some information on the types of weather events likely to happen in these environments and what their DC range should be.

Not every encounter is meant to be a fight the players should be forced into. If the players are on the lower end of the level range, some of the encounters might be overwhelming for them, and they should have the option to attempt to avoid combat through other interactions, hiding, or fleeing. You can avoid encounters that seem like they wouldn't fit the current situation or modify them as needed.

### Howling Ridge (Level 1-4)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 4 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 20 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 10 (15 without roads or markers) <br>
**Weather DC:**  Save DCs for weather events range from 10-15.

This mountain passed was once considered relatively safe and well-traveled. The paths through it are well-worn and marked to make the pass as navigable as possible. However, things took a turn for the worst when a werewolf pack moved into the area and, over the course of just a few nights, slaughtered an entire convoy of settlers making their way through the pass to start a new life on the other side. This act of brutality cursed the mountain ridge and earned it its new name. Since then, the pack has mostly disbanded into lone werewolves or, at most, very small packs who continue to stalk the mountain paths for foolhardy travelers. The mountain's curse ensures that those who die here can find no peace, and the pass is filled with roaming undead who occasionally even attempt to enact vengeance against the murderous werewolves.

These primordial jungle mountains are home to many overgrown temples and roads built by the lizardmen in ages past. The lizardmen recently moved an expeditionary force into these ruins to begin restoring them for reoccupation. Many bands of gorillas who made these ruins their home were driven out in the process. 

Unfortunately for the lizardmen, these apes have deeper ties to the land than they'd realized, and they seemed to have formed into an intelligent fighting force capable of performing hit-and-run attacks against their reptilian foes. The gorilla troops seem to have been unified by a mighty titanic ape that has arisen from its long slumber to lead the simian army against lizardmen.

**Weather:** Save DCs for weather events range from 20-25.


These barren mountains were once home to active volcanos and chaos dwarf workshops. The dwarves lost their holdings to a laborer uprising, and the volcanos have become dormant. The wreckage of old machinery remains, along with roaming constructs, no longer bound to their dwarven creators. Recently, the chaos dwarves have begun sending expeditionary forces to the crags to determine if their old territory can be reclaimed. 

However, their practice of capturing demons to bind within their machines is now coming back to bite them, for many fiends once held within the abandoned workshops have broken free and now prey on any who enter the crags. There are even scattered reports that one or more daemon princes may be in the area, attempting to rally a small fiendish army.

These mountains were once part of the ancient empire of the giants. Since the collapse of their empire, it has been occupied by different tribes of warring yetis. The more savage yetis will attack other creatures on sight and are ruthless hunters. The enlightened meh-teh yetis are at war with their savage kin and will ally with humanoids who have proven their worth. Other massive predators hunt the yetis and any other travelers they find. Recently, giants have begun reappearing in their old territory, and they seem to view all yetis as unwelcome pests in their homes that must be purged.

# Mountain <br> Creatures

## Apes

### Gorillas
Gorillas are among the largest known primates. Adult male gorillas, known as "silverbacks" due to the characteristic patch of silver hair on their backs and hips, can stand up to 5.6 feet tall in the wild and weigh up to 400 pounds. Gorillas dwell in tropical forests, many of which are in mountainous terrain. 

They live in groups known as troops, typically composed of one dominant silverback, several adult females, and their offspring. The dominant silverback makes decisions like where to forage and make nesting sites.

Gorillas are extremely strong, with the ability to lift and carry almost twice their body weight. Despite their size and strength, gorillas are also quite agile and can climb trees when needed.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

 However, gorillas are primarily terrestrial <br> and move around by a form of locomotion called <br> knuckle-walking, where they support their weight on the backs of their curved fingers rather than their palms. 

Despite their size and strength, gorillas are typically gentle and shy. They can, however, be fierce and extremely formidable when they feel threatened or when the safety of their group, especially the infants, is in jeopardy. Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plants, leaves, stems, roots, vines, and fruits. Some species consume small invertebrates, but hunting for larger creatures is unheard of. Conflicts with explorers and adventurers arise when they stumble into gorilla territory and appear to pose a threat or when something is amiss in the environment that is agitating the gorillas and driving them to higher levels of aggression.

### Giant Apes
Giant apes, sometimes called dire gorillas, are colossal, sentient primates and a beacon of fear and respect throughout their wild homelands. These enormous beasts dwarf their mundane cousins, standing up to 20 feet tall and weighing as much as 2,000 pounds. Their hide is a rugged canvas of thick fur ranging from dark brown to pitch black, and their piercing eyes hold an eerie intelligence that betrays their brutish appearance.

Giant apes possess a strength unparalleled in the natural world, a trait that they use to protect their territory and kin fiercely. Despite their terrifying strength, they exhibit an unexpected grace, moving silently through their surroundings, their giant forms blending into the shadows of the forests and mountains they call home.

While generally peaceful, they become fearsome opponents when their kin or territory is threatened, capable of causing devastation with their bare hands.

 Giant apes rarely tolerate dangerous predators in their territory and often clash with other mighty beasts as they work to keep their home secure. A group of giant apes driven to a rampage by an overwhelming number of threats to their home is a force to be reckoned with and one deeply feared by other jungle-dwelling creatures. 

Giant apes are considered sacred by many cultures, seen as guardians of nature, and are often central in local folklore and myths. Many adventuring parties seek them out, drawn by tales of their immense power and majesty. However, those who approach with ill intent or disrespect are met with the full force of a giant ape’s wrath, a sight few live to recount.

### Jufu
In the jagged peaks and deep valleys of the mountainous regions, where the terrain is harsh and unforgiving, resides a unique species of ape known as the Jufu. They are a hardy breed, remarkably adapted to their elevated environment. About the size of an average chimp, the Jufu's physique belies their impressive strength and skill.

Jufus have a distinctive feature that sets them apart from their primate relatives - their unusually powerful arms and broad hands. This physical trait, paired with their keen vision, makes them exceptional throwers. These apes have an uncanny knack for hurling stones with remarkable precision and deadly force, a skill that has earned them a formidable reputation.

This talent is not merely a method of hunting, but an essential part of their survival strategy. When hunting, Jufus gather at vantage points high above their prey, pelting them with a barrage of rocks. The stunned or injured prey provides an easy meal for these clever hunters.
This stone-throwing ability also serves as a crucial defensive strategy. Intruders venturing into their territory are greeted by a rain of stones from the heights, making Jufus particularly effective at driving off larger predators or rival clans. This ability has earned them an aura of respect, and even fear, amongst other creatures who share their mountainous home.

In the folklore of nearby human settlements, Jufus are often depicted as guardians of the mountains, with their stone-throwing seen as a mystical ability to control the elements. Tales are told of lost travelers guided to safety by the path of stones thrown by a Jufu, or of invading forces deterred by a storm of rocks from the mountain apes.

> Jufus are not based on any real-world apes but are instead inspired by creatures of the same name from Chinese mythology.

### Titanic Apes
Titanic Apes are mythical creatures whispered of in hushed reverence among scholars and adventurers alike. Standing at staggering heights up to 100 feet, titanic apes dwarf most humanoid structures. Their bodies are powerfully built, covered in thick fur that ranges from jet black to silver-gray. Their eyes glow with an almost human-like intelligence, and an undeniable, primal ferocity.

Their strength is the stuff of legends, said to be capable of shattering buildings and sweeping away scores of puny humanoid warriors with a mere sweep of their enormous arms. Despite their colossal size, these behemoths move with surprising agility, traversing dense forests, scaling mountainous terrain, and even swimming across vast oceanic stretches.

Yet, they are not mere beasts of brute force. Titanic apes possess a profound wisdom and understanding of the world. Their low, rumbling vocalizations, akin to the vibrations of the earth, are thought to be a complex language, and their memory is believed to span across centuries, holding the knowledge of the ancients within their minds.

Titanic apes live in solitude, each holding dominion over vast territories that they guard fiercely. Intrusion into their realm is not taken lightly. They have an innate connection to the wilderness within their territories, making them the ultimate guardians of their domain.

They are mostly peaceful, preferring to keep to their own territories, away from the civilized world. However, when enraged or threatened, they can cause immense destruction, their roars alone capable of breaking the resolve of any wh would dare to keep their rampage in check.

Despite their formidable power and size, titanic apes are considered symbols of primal power and protection in many cultures. They are often central characters in ancient myths and legends, embodying the raw, untamed essence of the world.

#### Epic Titanic Ape Encounter
If you're aiming to transform a titanic ape into a formidable adversary for an intense boss battle, consider doubling its maximum hit points to a total of 597, elevating its CR to 20, and granting it the following trait:<br><br>

> ***Tantrum (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Upon reaching half its hit points (297 or less), the ape ends any spells or conditions of its choice that are currently affecting it. Simultaneously, it releases any creatures or objects it is holding and commences a ground-pounding tantrum that can last up to a minute. <br> In order to maintain this tantrum, the ape must use its action each turn to use Ferocious Roar. The tantrum ends early if it ends its turn without using Ferocious Roar, loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), or can no longer reach a solid surface with its arms.<br> While the ape is engaged in this tantrum, it gains the following effects:<br>
> * Both its hands are considered occupied.
> * It cannot use the Grasp, Throw, or Rending Bite legendary actions
> * It gains Reverberating Slam (described below) as a bonus action and a legendary action.<br><br>
> **Reverberating Slam.** Each creature within 60 feet of the titanic ape must succeed a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the ape. If the save fails by 10 or more (DC 11), the creature is pushed 20 feet away. On a successful save, the creature only takes half the damage and isn't pushed.

### Ape Tactics



#### Gorillas and Giant Apes 
These large apes are non-violent by nature and will generally only attack if surprised or threatened. Initially, they attempt to scare opponents away through intimidation. If this fails, they will charge, attacking and grappling their adversary. They might even throw the opponent they want to encourage to leave.

#### Jufu
Jufus exhibit behavior similar to chimpanzees, hunting small game and living in small groups. They may exhibit aggression towards other mountain creatures that encroach on their territory. Jufus prefer to fight from a position of advantage, such as higher ground, pelting their opponents with rocks until they retreat. If a creature manages to reach the jufu by climbing, the jufu might attempt to shove it down the cliff.



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Titanic Apes
Titanic apes behave similarly to gorillas and giant apes. They first attempt to use their Ferocious Roar to scare off opponents. If unsuccessful, they will charge into the battle, primarily using Slam if they can hit two or more targets, or Bite if they can only reach a single target.

**Legendary Actions.** If the titan ape manages to grapple a target, it will use Rending Bite on the grappled target and then throw it. If a target escapes its grapple, the ape will attempt to grapple the target again, then throw it, and finally attempt to grapple a different target on its next turn.

While not highly intelligent, titan apes are smart enough to differentiate between enemies who can deal damage from a distance and those who need to be in melee. They strategically use their grapple to control the battlefield, potentially flinging a grappled melee attacker far away or toward another ranged enemy. They also line up players for multi-target Slam attacks.

**Mythic Encounter.** In the mythic version, the Titan Ape loses all tactical instincts during its tantrum, blindly charging toward the closest foe.

### Ape Loot
The valuable items looted from apes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Apes don’t provide quite as much quality harvesting materials as other beasts, but because giant apes and titanic apes are more intelligent, they may wear or keep more valuable items they’ve collected. If you’re using a giant or titanic ape in a climactic battle, it is usually good to provide some high-value “art objects” from the DMG they’ve collected for players to find. 


#### Ape Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Goats & Sheep

### Bighorn Sheep

Bighorn Sheep, named for the large, curved horns carried by the males or 'rams', are impressive animals that dwell in mountainous and desert regions. The rams' horns are particularly notable, coiling back from the forehead and down around the ears, with some reaching lengths of over 30 inches. Females, or "ewes", are smaller in size and have shorter, less curved horns. Their coloration ranges from light brown to grayish or dark, chocolate brown, with a distinguishing white belly and rump patch.

Known for their agility and grace, Bighorn Sheep are expert climbers. They have an uncanny ability to traverse steep and rocky terrains, with their specialized cloven hooves providing an excellent grip. They are particularly adept at leaping great distances, a useful skill in the rocky and treacherous habitats they call home.

However, rams are best known for their intense battles for dominance, charging at each other with their impressive horns. These charges, which can reach speeds up to 20 miles per hour, result in a crash that echoes through the mountains, indicating that a contest for dominance is underway. 

The strength of a bighorn sheep should not be underestimated, particularly in the case of the ram's powerful charge. Their adept ability to navigate their steep, rocky home makes them a difficult animal to pursue. Therefore, engaging with these majestic beasts calls for considerable caution. 

***Dire Bighorns.*** The dire bighorn is a species of giant ram capable of living in extremely harsh mountain environments. Far outsizing other mundane mountain creatures, this ram can deliver bone shattering blows with its skull. This combined with their mountain climbing agility, deters almost all other mountain creatures from attempting to hunt them. Mountain dwarves will often use captured dire bighorns for agricultural use and as fearsome and dependable mounts when traversing their rocky homes.

### Domestic Goats

The domestic goat, one of the oldest tamed livestock species, is a ubiquitous symbol of rural life across the world. A typical domestic goat stands around two feet tall at the shoulder, though larger breeds can reach three feet or more. Their bodies are covered in a variety of coats, ranging from smooth hair to luxuriant cashmere wool. 

Domestic goats are hardy, adaptable creatures, capable of surviving in a wide range of environments. This adaptability, coupled with their usefulness, has led to their spread around the world. They provide milk, meat, and wool, and in many cultures, they hold significant symbolic or religious importance.

In folklore and myth, goats often play interesting roles. They are sometimes seen as symbols of stubbornness, independence, and fertility. In many cultures, they are linked with pastoral deities or earthy, rustic magic. 

Despite their independent nature, goats are generally sociable creatures, forming close bonds with their keepers and other livestock. They are known for their curiosity and intelligence, and anyone who has spent time around goats can attest to their playful and mischievous behavior.

### Mountain Goats
Mountain goats are nimble creatures that dwell in high alpine regions. Their striking white coats contrast against the rocky terrain they are often found in. Both males and females sport black, dagger-like horns, which can reach up to 10 inches long and provide them with formidable natural weapons. 

Despite their name and appearance, mountain goats are not true goats but are more closely related to cattle, gazelles, and antelopes. They don’t possess the same reinforced skulls of goats and, as such, don’t use ramming attacks. Instead, they utilize deadly piercing attacks from their horns, which can be deadly to creatures as large as bears. 

Mountain goats have specialized hooves built for navigating precarious cliffs and rocky slopes. They are able to run up and down sheer cliffs with ease, traversing areas impassable to other creatures. This adaptation, combined with incredible jumping capabilities, gives them a significant advantage in rough terrain, making them difficult creatures to chase or escape from.

Mountain goats can be quite aggressive and formidable adversaries. Males in mating season are prone to being belligerent, but even female mountain goats can be so hostile that males will avoid them when not looking to mate. This, combined with superior climbing abilities, powerful leaps, and impressive horn attacks, make them deadly adversaries in their natural environment.

### Terror Goat 
Beyond the realm of ordinary fauna, in the harshest and most forsaken corners of the mountain ranges, lurks a beast of nightmare and legend, the terror goat. It's not a creature merely born of the wild, but a monstrosity formed from raw, unbridled terror, its very existence a testament to nature's more savage and merciless aspects.

The terror goat is an anomaly among its kin, a grotesque and exaggerated silhouette of the typical mountain goat. It is enormous in size, standing well over ten feet tall at the shoulder, a hulking brute whose mere presence strikes fear into the hearts of both beasts and men alike. Its hide is a mottled gray, as hard and rough as the stones of its mountain home. Yet, it is the creature's skull that is its most terrifying feature. Formed of solid rock, it is a cruel parody of a normal goat's head. Its beady eyes shine with malice, and its skull sports a pair of massive, jagged stone horns that gleam with an ominous luster.

The terror goat is the embodiment of primal fear and aggression. Its rocky skull is a formidable weapon, though it leaves little room for a brain and renders the beast incredibly dim-witted. It charges mindlessly at any perceived threat and can smash through solid stone and demolish structures with frightening ease. The beast seems to be waging an endless well of mindless aggression, attacking with a reckless abandon that terrifies even the bravest of warriors. Whether it is attacking creatures, objects, or structures, the terror goat relentlessly smashes until nothing is left.


Local mountain tribes speak of the terror goat in hushed whispers, a cautionary tale to those who would disturb the unforgiving wilderness. They believe that it was born from the mountain's wrath itself, a manifestation of nature's unchecked fury. It is said that merely being near the terror goat is enough to induce a profound, mortal terror, a dread so deep that it can break even the stoutest heart.

### Goats & Sheep Tactics
Goats and sheep are generally stubborn creatures and excel in one-on-one combat due to their Cranial Plating feature. If one becomes outnumbered or its opponent gains the advantage over it, it may attempt to flee to find its herd and gain safety in numbers. Goats and sheep with a climb speed will prefer to fight and flee in rocky terrain where they have the advantage and can flee more easily if need be.

Unless directed by a more intelligent creature, goats and sheep will use their Head Bash ability every turn until they miss, after which they will revert to regular attacks. A more intelligent creature may direct them to target enemies with lower AC, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit.

Mountain goats don’t have the Skull Bash or Cranial Plating abilities and instead rely on charging attacks with their horns. They will use their climbing and jumping abilities to outmaneuver foes in rocky terrain and get a running start to make skewering attacks whenever possible.


#### Terror Goats
Terror goats are even more belligerent, stubborn, and less intelligent than regular goats. They exhibit no fear, even when losing battles. Their malevolent nature means they will relentlessly pursue foes to the death, smashing through anything that gets in their way.

### Goat & Sheep Loot
The valuable items looted from goats and sheep will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. Because terror goats are partially stone, you may also allow players to make **Wisdom (Carver's Tools)** checks when harvesting them. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Goat & Sheep Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Mountain Birds
### Condors
Condors are among the largest flying birds in the <br> world, often reaching lengths of up to 4.5 feet and <br> sporting wingspans that can reach up to 10 feet. <br> Their appearance is similar to that of vultures, <br> with feathers that are a mix of black and other <br> colors and heads and necks devoid of feathers. 

Condors are known for their extraordinary flight <br> abilities. They use thermal updrafts to soar and <br> glide through the air, often for hours, without <br> flapping their wings. This helps them conserve <br> energy as they soar at heights of up to 15,000 feet. <br> They have a keen eyesight which allows them to <br> spot potential food from high altitudes.
Condors <br> are scavengers, feeding mostly on the carcasses <br> of dead animals. They play an important role in <br> their ecosystems by helping to get rid of decaying <br> matter. Their extremely strong stomach acid helps <br> them digest this carrion, which can include bones, <br> without getting sick.

These large birds are incredibly adaptable, <br> being able to endure the harsh conditions of high <br> mountain peaks as well as rugged badland cliffs. <br> Condors often feature prominently in the legends <br> of mountain dwelling humanoid tribes. Their ability <br> to soar among the mountain tops is associated with <br> a divine status, and many consider condors <br> messengers serving the gods on high.

Condors seldom have any reason to attack <br> humanoids unless threatened. However, mountain <br> dwelling druids or gods associated with condors <br> may use them as sentries among the peaks. Such <br> condors may even be persuaded to attack intruders <br> with beak and claw. Though they will usually wait <br> until their foes are distracted by other combatants <br> or on dangerous high terrain before they make <br> their attack.

### Argentavis
Argentavis is an ancient species of bird and thought to be one of the largest flying birds that has ever lived. Its body reaches 12 feet in length, and its massive wingspan stretches out to 20 feet. This colossal bird, as mighty as it is magnificent, relies heavily on thermal soaring for flight. Like the smaller condor cousins, the argentavis capitalizes on the warm, rising air currents to traverse vast distances, flapping its enormous wings sparingly to conserve energy. Its takeoff involves a wind-assisted run combined with a leaping motion, showcasing the bird's immense strength and agility.

Yet, the argentavis is not just an accomplished aviator, but a ruthless scavenger. The large, hooked beak, reminiscent of an executioner's blade, is perfectly adapted for tearing into the flesh of the fallen. When the argentavis descends onto a carcass, other scavengers are wise to yield, for contesting the massive bird’s claim could invite the wrath of its razor-sharp talons.

Many believe agentavis to be long extinct, leaving behind only fossils and ancient legends. However, some believe they still soar within primeval mountains cut off from civilization, feasting on the remains of mighty beasts and would-be explorers. Others believe those that remain act in service of demi-gods who rule their domains from the highest peaks.

#### Dread Argentavis
Though the argentavis is assumed to be the largest “natural” bird to have lived, some believe that an even larger variant referenced in ancient legends may still exist. Referred to as the dread argentavis, this massive creature does indeed soar over long forgotten mountain ranges, its shadow casting an ominous pall over the landscape below. 

As wide as a longship's sail and black as onyx, its wings spread across the sky, a silent and foreboding symbol of power. This colossal avian creature, standing taller than the mightiest warhorse and with a wingspan greater than 30 feet, is the stuff of legends.

The dread argentavis, also known as the "Titan of the Skies", possesses a fearsome visage. Its glossy black feathers shimmer in the sunlight as it soars effortlessly on thermal currents. A large hooked beak is perfect for tearing apart carrion or intimidating potential rivals. Its eyes, like twin orbs of polished obsidian, are sharp and discerning, capable of spotting a rabbit scurrying in the underbrush from thousands of feet above.

However, the dread argentavis, for all its might, does not prey on the living. It is the ultimate scavenger, preferring to feed upon the carcasses of fallen beasts. Its deadly beak an massive talons are used to drive off other creatures that would challenge its right to the carrion of its choice, and many headstrong adventurers have suffered the consequences of challenging the dread argentavis’s claims.

### Condor & Argentavis Adventure Hooks
| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Condor's Feather:** A local apothecary needs a feather from a condor to complete a powerful healing elixir. The problem is, condors are found only in the highest, most treacherous mountains. Can the party navigate the dangerous peaks, outwit any mountainous threats, and get close enough to a condor to acquire a feather without harming the bird?|
|  2  |**The Condor’s Eye:** A famed explorer has discovered a rare gemstone known as the "Condor’s Eye" in a distant land. However, it's said that removing the gemstone would anger the spirits of the condors protecting it. True enough, the city where the gemstone is displayed is now plagued by aggressive condors, attacking citizens and causing chaos. The party is hired to safely return the Condor’s Eye and placate the angry spirits. |
|  3  |**Roost of the Silver King:** Legends tell of an ancient argentavis, known as The Silver King, whose roost was hidden in the mountains. It's believed to have collected shiny objects, including a powerful magical artifact lost to time. The adventurers stumble upon a partial map to this roost and decide to seek out the treasure. Little do they know, the Silver King's decendants still fiercely protect the roost.|
|  4  |**The Peak-Top Raiders:** A tribe of mountain-dwelling goblins have somehow tamed several argentavis and are using them to harass and attack the nearby settlements. The local lord seeks the party's help in dealing with the aerial menace and ending the goblin threat.|
|  5  |**Argentavis Rampage:** A massive dread argentavis has begun terrorizing a mountain region, disrupting trade routes and causing havoc. The adventurers are hired to deal with the problem. However, once they arrive, they discover that a spiteful druid is enraging the creature. |
|  6  | **The Aerial Tournament:** The kingdom is hosting an aerial racing tournament, and the prize is an dread argentavis as a mount. The competition is fierce, with many powerful figures interested in winning.  |

### Condor and Argentavis Tactics
These birds are primarily scavengers and will generally avoid combat when able. If they've been compelled to combat other creatures, they will stick to a basic strategy of using their claw and talon attacks against isolated targets to avoid being surrounded. If they are surrounded, they will generally disengage and take to the air. If targets are near a ledge, they may attempt to shove them off.

## Snow Leopards

The snow leopard, an elusive and majestic creature, is a medium-sized cat renowned for its striking coat of thick, white to smoky-gray fur, embellished with black spots and rosettes. Residing in the unforgiving mountain ranges, this creature is the epitome of endurance and grace. It possesses a robust body adapted for the harsh cold and rugged terrain, with wide, fur-covered feet that act as natural snowshoes and a long, furry tail for balance.

Snow leopards are solitary, nocturnal creatures with extraordinary climbing and leaping abilities, making them formidable hunters. They can easily cover vast distances, leaping up to 50 feet in a single bound. Despite their size, snow leopards are extraordinarily stealthy, using their camouflaging coat to blend into the rocky terrain and patiently stalk their prey.

Adapted for life in a cold, high altitude environment, they have smaller ears and a shorter muzzle to minimize heat loss, as well as large nasal cavities to warm the frigid air before it reaches their lungs. Their long, flexible tails not only aid in maintaining balance on narrow mountain ledges but also double as a cozy blanket, wrapping around their bodies to shield them from the cold.

Snow leopards are ambush hunters that prey on large mountain mammals of the mountains. Their agility enables them to navigate their rocky environment and quickly leap onto unsuspecting targets in the blink of an eye. Their physiology allows them to traverse many levels of mountain elevation in their search for their next meal, from alpine peaks to forested valleys. 

### Dire Snow Leopards
Dire snow leopards are a larger, more formidable variant of the ordinary snow leopard. Unlike their regular counterparts, Dire snow leopards can grow to the size of a small horse, while maintaining the agility and grace inherent to their species. They retain the solitary and nocturnal habits of their smaller kin. However, their physical prowess and hunting abilities are vastly superior. Capable of leaping extraordinary distances and climbing sheer cliff faces, they are fearsome predators that can take down prey much larger than themselves.

Dire snow leopards are embedded in the local folklore of the regions they inhabit. They are revered as symbols of strength and resilience, often depicted as guardians of the mountains. Their elusive nature and striking appearance have contributed to numerous legends and tales, wherein a sighting of a dire snow leopard is considered a sign of good fortune or a harbinger of significant change.

### Frost Saber Leopards 
Frost saber leopards, like their non-magical kin, are solitary creatures, stalking the icy wilderness with a graceful yet deadly intent. Their hunting prowess is unrivaled due to their unique icy magic. Frost saber leopards possess a supernatural cunning and an innate desire to destroy evil. In the wild, they hunt hunt wicked monsters for sport, and even deadly monsters such as trolls and manticores aren’t safe from their predations. 

When a frost saber leopard strikes, its claws sap the strength and vitality of its prey, rendering them weak and more susceptible to the effects of their deadly bite. The fangs of these magical beasts are infused with a potent frost magic that freezes the blood of their victims, causing debilitating slowness and preventing wounds from healing. This combination of abilities makes the Frost Saber Leopard a terrifyingly efficient predator.

Frost saber leopards are steeped in the myths and legends of the regions they inhabit. They are often depicted as the chosen guardians of ancient ice deities, their very presence considered an omen of significant events or changes. The chilling beauty of their icy fangs and claws has inspired countless tales, while their unique hunting abilities have made them subjects of awe and fear. The priests and druids of some cultures are even able to summon frost saber leopards so they may serve as gaurdians in times of need. These noble beasts fight alongside their humanoid allies in service of the greater cause they pursue together.

### Snow Leopard Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Guardians of the Sacred Grove:** Local legends tell of a sacred grove, protected by a group of snow leopards. Recently, these leopards have started attacking nearby villages. The adventurers are asked to find out why the leopards are acting out of character, leading to a plot involving a polluted water source affecting the grove.|
|  2  |**The Snow Leopard Totem:** An enchanted totem that controls snow leopards has fallen into the wrong hands. Bandits are using it to terrorize the locals and protect their hideout. The party must infiltrate the hideout, neutralize the totem, and free the leopards from the bandits' control.  |
|  3 | **The Snow Leopard's Prey:** A dire snow leopard has developed a taste for livestock, and the locals are growing desperate. The party is hired to track and drive the beast back into the wilderness. However, they soon discover that the leopard's increased aggression might be linked to an even greater danger.|
|  4  |**The Legend of the Leopard:** An ancient prophecy tells of a dire snow leopard appearing when a great disaster is about to befall. With recent sightings of such a beast, the local inhabitants are in a state of panic. The adventurers must investigate, uncovering the looming disaster and finding a way to prevent it. |
|  5  |**The Cursed Claws:** A frost saber leopard has been corrupted by a dark curse and its icy magic has grown out of control, threatening nearby villages. The players must find a way to lift the curse and save the leopard and the villages from a deadly, ever-expanding winter. |
|  6  | **The Frost Saber Mystery:** A frost saber leopard has been spotted for the first time in centuries, far from its natural habitat, causing panic and fear among the locals. The adventurers must unravel why the magical creature has descended from its glacial realms, discovering a plot involving a rogue wizard attempting to control the powerful creature. |

### Snow Leopard Tactics
Snow leopards are skilled ambush predators that, while capable of inflicting high damage, have comparatively low health. These creatures carefully choose their battles, engaging only when they can launch an ambush or when a target is isolated, preferably both. They steer clear of combat in other situations.

When a snow leopard does enter combat, it won't hesitate to retreat if the circumstances turn unfavorable. Indications for this could be when its health drops below half or when its initial ambush fails to knock the target prone or secure it in a grapple.

##### Frost Saber Leopards
Frost sabers use more of the same tactics. Their decision to either flee or continue fighting is influenced by the effectiveness of their bite’s chilling effect. If a target succumbs to its icy bite, the frost saber will be more likely to stay engaged in the battle to finish off the debilitated target.

### Snow Leopard Loot
The valuable items looted from snow leopards will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Snow Leopard Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Stonehorns

Resembling a monstrous, wholly predatory oxen, a stonehorn is a sight to behold. Its body is an impressive mass of hulking muscle, layered with rock-hard skin that is a cross between stone and hide. This natural armor protects the stonehorn from the biting cold of their frigid habitat, as well as the attacks of any who would dare to challenge them. Only the strongest of blows can damage its stony form, and slashing weapons ineffectually scrap against it.

The stonehorn's most notable feature is its massive pair of forward-curving horns. These are not mere bone but an extension of its stone-like hide, imbued with the strength of the mountains themselves. A charge from a stonehorn can level fortress walls or shatter a line of heavily armored warriors with horrifying ease.

These titanic beasts possess an insatiable appetite for eating not just flesh, but the very stone and earth itself. This unusual diet fuels the powerful magic that keeps these creatures alive in their hostile environment and helps to mend their bodies in the event of injury. This act of consuming stone also has an interesting side effect; over time, rocks, minerals, and even precious gems become embedded in a stonehorn's hide, making it even tougher.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

In combat, stonehorns are terrifyingly powerful and nigh unstoppable, their charges akin to a landslide that decimates everything in its path. They can sense the presence of the precious gems they crave and will trample through everything in their path to reach their next meal. Foes who actually manage to significantly wound the stonehorn kindle an even greater fury within it, and the stonehorn will not cease the pursuit of the attackers until they have been splattered across the rocks.

As stonehorns age, more and more of their body gradually calcifies and turns to stone as it incorporates the minerals they consume throughout their long lifetime. Stonehorns near death seek out a secluded location where they fall into a deep hibernation until their body fully calcifies into an inert mass of stone.

Some powerful mountain races attempt to capture and break stonehorns for use as mounts and beasts of war. Most of these attempts are met with the would-be tamer meeting a violent and gory death. However, on the rare occasion that it succeeds, the hunter earns a mighty mount with no equal in their mountainous home. These stonehorn mounts are often sold for a hefty price to mountain warlords and chieftains, who use them as a status symbol and ride them into combat in times of war. Upon these unstoppable steeds, they are able to singlehandedly turn the tide of battle as they shatter enemy lines with the stonehorn’s near-unstoppable charge.

### Icehorns
In the harshest, most remote glacial regions, <br> where even the bravest explorers fear to tread, <br> dwell the legendary icehorns. They are a rare <br> and incredibly powerful variant of stonehorns, <br> adapted to the brutal cold and capable of  harnessing <br> the very ice and snow that permeates their unforgiving homeland.

Like stonehorns, icehorns feed on the minerals found <br> in their environment, but their diet is heavily supplemented with glacial ice and frost-encrusted rocks, infusing them <br> with potent cold magic. This grants them the ability to encase their already formidable bodies in a layer of magical ice. 

This is no mere frost, but a nearly impenetrable armor of solid, gleaming ice that is as hard as diamond. While encased in this icy armor, the icehorn's crystalline horns become even more lethal, capable of freezing and shattering opponents with a single blow.
However, this power does not come without a cost as the ice greatly slows their movements. They become lumbering, albeit unstoppable, fortresses of ice, reminiscent of a moving glacier, slow but unstoppable.

Interestingly, icehorns have complete control over this icy transformation. With a mighty shake, similar to a dog shedding water, an icehorn can shatter the icy armor encasing it, regaining its speed and agility. This ability to shift between a swift, powerful battering ram and an armored juggernaut makes icehorns incredibly unpredictable in battle.

>
> ***Wild Shove.*** A creature the icehorn is aware of within 5 feet of it must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage, and it is pushed 20 feet away. It can only use this action if it is not in its Glacial Stance.
>
> ***Glacial Stomp. (Costs 2 Actions)*** The icehorn makes a Hooves attack. On hit, the attack deals an additional 27 (6d8) cold damage. It can only use this action if it is in its Glacial Stance.

### Stonehorn Tactics
When left to its own devices, the stonehorn relies on instinct, primarily driven by its insatiable appetite for precious metals and gems, which it consumes to nourish its earthen form. Thanks to its Treasure Sense ability, it identifies and charges at the creature holding the most valuable gems and gold, aiming to slaughter them by running them over repeatedly for maximum charge damage. When faced with multiple creatures possessing equal amounts of treasure, the stonehorn prefers targets adorned with the most metal. However, it shifts its attention towards any creature inflicting substantial damage (30 or more in a single turn), directing its Earth-Shattering Smash at that particular threat. The stonehorn instinctively utilizes its Stone Plating reaction against attacks it doesn’t have resistance to and that don’t have their damage reduced by its Stone Skeleton trait.

If under the guidance of a more intelligent creature, the stonehorn strategically focuses its attention on the largest group of creatures, charging at full speed from one target to another if they are spread out. The intelligent creatures guiding the stonehorn may also instruct it to reserve its Stone Plating reaction for high-damage single attacks from enemies like Paladins or Rogues, provided those attacks have a way to bypass its resistances.

#### Icehorn Tactics
The icehorn boasts a unique ability known as Glacial Stance, and understanding when to utilize this stance forms a critical part of its strategy. If the icehorn is not guided by an intelligent creature, it assumes the Glacial Stance whenever a creature comes within 20 feet, seeking to leverage the stance's higher defense.

When controlled by a more intelligent creature, the icehorn adopts the Glacial Stance whenever its enemies are reachable with melee attacks. If there are priority targets more than 20 feet away, the snow horn will exit its Glacial Stance to reach them.

The icehorn possesses two pairs of legendary actions whose use is dependent on whether it's in Glacial Stance:

**Frost Bite/Glacial Stomp:** The icehorn uses Glacial Stomp to crush a melee-range target that's drawn its attention. Conversely, Frost Bite targets solitary adversaries out of melee range, dealing moderate damage when it does not wish to waste time charging over to a new foe.

**Wild Shove/Trample:** The icehorn employs Wild Shove to position a target such that it can hit multiple creatures with its Earth-Shattering Smash or to create an escape route if it needs to withdraw from melee range. This tactic enables the Stonehorn to charge back and forth for devastating attacks without drawing opportunity attacks. Similarly, Trample is used to move toward a solitary target, stomp it, then return to the original position on its next turn for a full charge.

### Stonehorn Loot
The valuable items looted from stonehorns will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. Because stonehorns are filled with gems are partially stone, you may also allow players to make **Wisdom (Carver's Tools)** or **Wisdom (Jeweler's Tools)** checks when harvesting them. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Stonehorn Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Yetis
These elusive creatures roam the remote <br> mountain ranges of the world. They are mysterious <br> creatures who can rarely be found if they don’t want <br> to be and are often the focus of many legends and folk tales amongst mountain folk. Over time, these stories often distort and over-simplify the true nature of yetis, and few truly understand them

***Many Varients.***
There are many kinds of yeti, with the most common yetis being a violent variant that often comes into conflict with travelers and mountain villages. This has led to a perception that all yetis are simplistic, brutish, and bestial mountain creatures. However, there is more nuance to yetis. They are a link between beast and human, and different types of yetis represent these aspects in different ways. 

***The Wild Men.***
Many temples, sacred monasteries, and druidic circles within the high peaks hold yetis up as a source of both fear and respect. Mountain myths speak of yetis existing in a realm between beast and humanoid, not truly belonging to either. Some mountain clerics tell tales of yeti ancestors who once walked the world alongside other humanoid races but retreated deep into the mountains as civilization developed. Others believe yetis are reincarnated druids who have lost sight of the boundary between man and beast, consigning themselves to roam the mountains in a state between worlds.

***Common Characteristics.*** 
Though they come in many varieties, all yetis share much in common. They all appear to be nearly humanoid primates who walk upright with loping strides. Their bodies are covered in shaggy fur, and their long limbs allow them to stride through snow and climb mountainous terrain with ease. These long limbs also lend themselves to grappling foes, and many yetis will even fling enemies off ledges in combat.

Many have a small pair of horns, and most have white coats to blend into their alpine homes. Combined with their silent, fluid movement, yetis are nearly impossible to spot in the mountains, especially in obscuring weather. For this reason, yetis will rarely attack unless they are able to catch their enemies off-guard and prefer attacking during blizzards.

Yetis also possess an innate connection to their icey homes which manifests itself in an instinctive form of ice magic. Different yetis manifest this in different ways, with some possessing an icey grasp, others able to freeze with a stare, and some even emitting a chilling aura.

### Dzu-Teh 
Dzu-teh are brown-furred, long-limbed yetis that walk primarily on their knuckles and stalk highland forests where their bodies blend with the trees. They are the most brutal of yeti-kind, combining the humanoid cunning and capacity for cruelty with the ruthless instincts and savagery of a predatory beast. Dzu-teh stalk their mountainous domain, leaving terror and bloodshed in their wake. The only evidence of their presence is the chilling high-pitched wails that echo through the night and the frozen remains left behind after their attacks.

***Murderous Predators.*** In combat, dzu-teh employ icicle-tipped claws and massive teeth to rip apart their prey. They can also manipulate the air temperature around them, causing it to drop so rapidly their victims freeze in place. However, they are at their most terrifying when they are able to unleash a flurry of claws upon a grappled creature, leaving behind nothing but gore and blood-stained slush on the mountainside. 

***Destroyers of Harmony.*** Dzu-teh kill anything they come across during their wanderings through the mountains, sparing only other lesser yetis who follow them out of fear. The only yetis that directly oppose the dzu-teh are the Meh-Teh, who despise these creatures, seeing them as the embodiment of the vilest aspects of both man and beast. It is said that Meh-Teh and dzu-teh engage in secret wars at the highest peaks of the mountains, their battles echoing through the desolate slopes in the dead of night.

### Meh-Teh
Meh-teh are the most elusive of all yetis. Known as protectors of the mountains, they are highly respected by those who inhabit their territories. The meh-teh prioritize balance and peace within their realm above all else. When peace is disrupted or chaos ensues, the meh-teh becomes a deadly force, determined to sweep away those responsible.

***Drawn to Enlightenment.*** Meh-teh are solitary creatures, avoiding contact with “civilized” beings. However, many monks believe that the meh-teh may appear before those who seek spiritual enlightenment deep within the mountains. If the individual possesses an honest soul, the meh-teh may even provide them shelter and sustenance, allowing the traveler to focus on their spiritual journey in peace and solitude. Some monasteries have a Meh-The patron that provides food and other gifts. In rare cases, the meh-teh may join the monastery and become a spiritual leader. However, monasteries with a meh-teh resident are weary of outsiders and often forbid their entry.

***Guardian of Nature and Civilization.*** Meh-teh are thought to embody a spiritual blend of man and animal, and they believe in the harmonious coexistence of civilization and the wilds. Villages and monasteries within their realms are careful not to expand their boundaries or disrupt the natural landscape. They may make offerings and hold religious ceremonies to express gratitude to the natural world and the meh-teh. 

\columnbreak


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Similarly, many predatory animals refrain from preying on livestock or villagers within these realms. If anyone disrupts this harmony, a piercing howl echoes through the mountains as a warning, and if the disrupters fail to heed it, they are soon met by the furious vengeance the meh-teh.

### Yeti Stalkers

Among what is regarded as the common variant of yeti are rare yeti individuals who possess even greater ferocity and icey magical traits. Known as yeti stalkers, or by some northern tribes as the “frozen nightmare,” they earned their titles by their ruthless hunting techniques. They actively stalk, ambush, and slaughter outsiders within their realm. These yetis possess an insatiable appetite beyond the rest of their kin and are constantly driven to find prey as they attempt to appease their neverending hunger.

***Enhanced Ice Magic.*** The bodies of yeti stalkers exude an eerie freezing aura that can cause instant hypothermia to any ill-prepared adventurer. This freezing aura not only serves as their primary defense but also as a weapon. They can imbue this chilling energy into objects, creating frost weapons capable of freezing and shattering their enemies in one fell swoop. These weapons are fashioned from large branches and end in magical ice formations, making them highly effective clubs. However, these ice-enchanted weapons carry with them the risk of being melted if they are exposed to fire or extreme heat.

***The Call to War.*** So great is their bloodlust that some warmongering tribes can summon them from their mountain homes when bloody battles are imminent. The yeti stalkers come howling down the mountains en masse to seize their opportunity for bountiful slaughter. They fight alongside their temporary allies, using their speed and frozen ferocity to rip through foes so they may enjoy the banquet of enemy corpses left behind afterward. How long these alliances last will depend on their allies' skill in keeping the yetis at bay while providing them with plentiful opportunities for bloodshed.

### Teh-Lma
Teh-lma are smaller yetis, standing about 4 to 5 feet tall. They inhabit lower altitudes compared to their larger counterparts and reside in areas where trees and greenery still thrive. Teh-lma primarily prey on small game and may even attack smaller isolated humanoids, such as halflings, gnomes, or goblins.

***Lower Yetis.*** Legends suggest that teh-lma represent the combined wisdom of both humanoid and wild animals, as well as the combined brutality of each. However, teh-lma are believed to have neither reached the heights of spiritual enlightenment nor the depths of barbaric cruelty as their kin. Consequently, they are shunned by both types of yeti, forcing them to dwell at lower altitudes in exile from their larger cousins. 

***Yeti Followers.*** On rare occasions, larger yetis have been observed leading small groups of teh-lma. Some speculate that this indicates teh-lma's attempt at completing their journey to enlightened redemption or total savagery. Teh-lma in the company of dzu-teh or “common yetis,” serve as ferocious packmates, aiding their kin in hunts and attacks on humanoids. Teh-lma following meh-teh act as disciples to a respected teacher from whom they seek spiritual guidance on their path to enlightenment.

### Yeti Tactics

Yetis are ambush predators well adapted to moving through mountainous alpine terrain. They rely on surprise attacks in snowy or rocky environments. If their ambush is thwarted, they will retreat and attempt to sneak up on their targets later. Most yetis have a way of paralyzing their victims, rendering them helpless. However, a common weakness all yetis share is their fear of fire. Constant fire damage can deter a determined yeti, forcing it to retreat temporarily and target the individual responsible for the fire damage in future encounters.

**Meh-Teh.** Meh-teh are rarely provoked to anger, but when they are, it is for a righteous cause. They never give up on punishing those they deem guilty. Meh-teh initiate combat with an all-out attack, aiming to grapple their foes and drag them away from allies. On the next turn, their actions depend on whether the target is still grappled. If it is, they deliver a bite before attempting to throw the frozen victim into their allies for additional damage. If the target is not grappled, the meh-teh continues to attempt to grapple and bite the victim as they drag it further away. They may consider throwing grappled victims off a high cliff if possible.

**Teh-Lma.** Teh-lma are the weakest and most cowardly among the yetis. They exhibit animalistic behavior but seem to be ashamed of it. If they encounter heavy resistance during an attack, they may flee and not return. Teh-lma employ similar tactics to meh-teh, using an action to attempt to freeze a creature and continuing to drag the victim away as described for meh-teh.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

**Dzu-Teh.** Dzu-teh differ from other yetis due to their Ravage attack. They prioritize moving their grappled targets away from allies so they can tear them apart without interruption. If overwhelmed by the allies of a grappled and prone creature, dzu-teh may choose to take the dash action and flee with their grappled target instead of risking being overwhelmed and losing their prey. However, if the target is paralyzed or the grappled target is bloodied, their predatory instincts kick in, and they unleash the Ravage attack regardless of the circumstances. Though they still use their normal movement to position themselves before executing this action.

**Yeti Stalkers.** While yeti stalkers can hunt alone, they prefer to be in groups. When attacking multiple creatures, they will attempt to circle around what they perceive as the weakest victim. This positioning allows all the yetis to subject their target and any creatures attempting to aid it to their Chilling Aura. Yetis will switch their focus to any victim that succumbs to the aura, using one of their attacks to automatically grapple the creature while the rest of the group continues to assault it. If the yetis are looking for a meal, they will each grab a frozen victim before making a retreat with their prey back up their mountain, making pursuit as difficult as possible.

### Yeti Loot
The valuable items looted from yetis will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

While yetis don't use much in the way of equipment, they may wear or keep more valuable items they’ve collected. If you’re using a yeti important to a story for a climactic battle, it is usually good to provide some high-value “art objects” from the DMG they’ve collected or crafted for players to find.

#### Yeti Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Zheng

Deep within the mountains, there lies a terror to those who dare to traverse the dangerous peaks and ridges: the zheng. Resembling a large, muscular feline, the zheng is roughly the size of a tiger with a coat of bristling fur that helps it blend into its mountainous home. Its body is as hard as the granite it treads, honed by years of life in the rugged terrain. At the end of its muscular body, multiple sinuous tails sway and twitch, each one capable of lashing and snapping with the force of a wicked whip.

But the creature's most chilling feature is its horn, a formidable, twisted spike of bone, gleaming deadly sharp. It protrudes from its forehead, wreathed by its wild mane, an ever-ready weapon to impale its unsuspecting prey.

The zheng is a creature of cunning and malice, choosing to hide and stalk its victims from the cover of dense mountain fog or among the fallen rocks. With a burst of speed that belies its size, it will descend upon travelers like a landslide, its horn aimed to impale. Its tails serve as added weapons, whipping out to lash and distract foes or sweep them off balance.

The creature's cruel, hook-like claws and sharp teeth are capable of shredding through armor and flesh alike, adding a gruesome end to its victims. Its hunting prowess is unparalleled, with its exceptional hearing and keen sight allowing it to pick out the smallest of movements in the mountainous terrain.

The zheng is a solitary hunter, and its haunting cries echoing through the mountains are a chilling reminder to all who hear them: no one is safe in the zheng's territory.

### Zheng Mountain Breakers
It is said that if a zheng lives long enough, it can establish a deeper connection with its mountainous home, allowing it to grow in power and gain newfound supremacy over its environment. These zheng are known as mountain breakers and are far more formidable than their common kin. The mountains imbue them with vitality, and their horns often grow to increased prominence. But it is their roars which undergo the most terrifying change. 

The zheng mountain breaker's terrifying roar is not just a display of dominance but a weapon of incredible power. When it bellows, the sheer force of the sound triggers tremors that reverberate through the mountain, causing rockslides and avalanches. It uses these cataclysms to bury and crush its prey, making escape nearly impossible.

With its prey trapped under the weight of the mountain, the mountain breaker descends from the peak, leaping from boulder to boulder with an agility that belies its massive size. It impales survivors on its horn and uses its tails to sweep away any remnants of resistance.

Many legends tell of its terrifying presence. The few who have survived its attacks speak of the mountains trembling under its roar, the air growing still with an ominous sense of doom before the landslide hits. Others recall the cold dread of being buried alive, only to see the beast's glowing eyes descending upon them in the darkness.

### Zheng Summit Sovereign

Even above the formidable zheng mountain breaker exists a being of furious power and terror, a creature whose legend is whispered with awe and fear among those who dare to climb the high, frozen peaks. It is known as the zheng summit sovereign, the frost-bound monarch of the world's highest, harshest realms.

The zheng summit sovereign is a hulking creature, its powerful body as large as a grizzly bear's. Its pelt, as icy white as its fridged home, is coarse and long, providing a natural barrier against the harsh, freezing winds of the icy mountains. The summit sovereign's formidable antler-like horn and multiple tails with iron-hard barbs are encrusted in a layer of eternal frost.
Its roar is a sound not just of power but of calamity, its booming echoes triggering not just landslides but whole glacial shifts. Entire ice sheets are dislodged by its calls, crashing down in a terrifying avalanche that buries and freezes its prey.

Most terrifying, however, are its claws and teeth. They're not only sharp as a dragon's but infused with a supernatural, freezing cold. A single scratch can cause frostbite, and a bite inflicts a creeping, icy doom into the victim's body, freezing them from the inside out.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

The origin of summit sovereigns remains shrouded in mystery. Ancient scrolls offer conflicting theories, with some suggesting they are the result of crossbreeding between a zheng and a frost saber leopard. Others speak of epic battles fought atop frozen mountains, where the victorious zheng gains mastery over the mountain and undergoes a transformation, becoming a summit sovereign.

Summit sovereigns make their lairs in the crevices of ice-encrusted peaks, areas so inhospitable that they are virtually untouched by outsiders. Their arrival is often heralded by a chilling wind that sweeps the peak and an ominous quiet that blankets the area.

Stories abound of climbers who ventured too high only to be trapped in a sudden, unexpected avalanche. When the rescuers finally dug out their bodies, they found them frozen solid, bearing horrifying claw and bite marks that glowed with an otherworldly frost.

Despite their dread-inducing reputation, the Zheng Glacial Monarchs are considered a living embodiment of the frozen wilderness, the harsh, relentless, yet awe-inspiring spirit of the high peaks. Their existence, as horrifying as it is, is a grim reminder of the unforgiving laws of nature in these extreme climates.

\pagebreakNum

### Zheng Tactics
Zheng are skilled ambush predators, choosing to strike when they have the element of surprise or when their target is isolated. If they find themselves in a disadvantageous situation, they will retreat and regroup to re-engage later with the advantage. Once zheng successfully ambush their prey and enter combat, they will not hesitate to retreat if the tide of the fight turns against them. This is especially true if they fail to knock their target prone, secure them in a grapple, or if their own health drops below half.
#### Mountain Breaker
Mountain breakers initiate their ambushes by using their Landslide ability on their intended prey before taking the Hide action as a bonus action. If a mountain breaker successfully hits multiple targets with its Landslide, it prioritizes attacking buried targets. It utilizes dashes and bonus action Hides to launch surprise attacks from different angles if it can stay hidden while doing so. If the combat conditions become unfavorable, the mountain breaker will retreat.
#### Summit Sovereign
The summit sovereign employs most of the same tactics as the mountain shaker. However, if a target succumbs to the icy effects of its bite, the summit sovereign is more likely to remain engaged in the battle to ensure the incapacitated can be finished off.

|  2  |**Horn of the Zheng:** A wealthy collector has heard rumors of a zheng living high up in a treacherous mountain pass. They're offering a substantial reward to any who can retrieve one of the zheng's barbed tails or its impressive horn, promising even more if the creature can be captured alive. |
|  3  |**The Mountain Breaker's Domain:** A mining company has been expanding their operations into the mountains, causing a disturbance to the zheng mountain breaker's territory. Now, the workers are being hunted down and the mining operation is threatened. The party is brought in to solve the mountain breaker problem.  |

|  5  |**Call to the Peak:** A party member dreams of a massive, shadowy creature causing an avalanche in a far-off mountain peak. As the snow clears, they see the glint of something valuable in the icy rubble. The vision leads them to the lair of a zheng summit sovereign. Is it a prophecy, a warning, or a deadly trap?   |
|  6  | **King of the Mountain:** A group of climbers who ascended the highest peak has not returned and the only sign of them is their abandoned camp on the mountainside. The adventurers are asked to find them. As they climb, they encounter signs of the zheng summit sovereign. They must find the climbers and deal with the icy terror that haunts the peak.   |

### Zheng Loot
The valuable items looted from zheng will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Zheng Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Encounter: Rise Of <br> The Gorilla God <br> (Player Level: 14-16)
In this encounter, the players are battling ape-worshipping cultists at the top of a mountain, where they are awakening the titanic ape they revere as a living god.

### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as the final battle of a larger adventure. The players may have had to fight their way up the mountain, battling apes and ape cultists. The cult may be trying to trigger an ape-pocalypse by awakening the titanic, and this battle may be the culmination of all their efforts. 


### Lead Up
The battle takes place on the peak of the mountain, and the players arrive up the steps from the lower side of the map. The titanic ape starts hidden in an enclosed chamber up the steps to the north of the map and will appear through a massive set of doors one round after the cultists detect the players. 

### Map Description
* **The Plaza.** The battle takes place in a massive stone plaza before a massive chamber that houses the titanic ape on top of the mountain. There are large steps coming up the mountain to the south the players arrive from and even larger stairs to the north leading up to the ape's chamber. There are also two smaller doors on either side of the ape's staircase leading into smaller chambers from which more cultists can arrive. <Br> Creatures without a climb speed can attempt to climb the plaza's walls and pillars by making a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Pillars.** These ancient decorative pillars are unstable are large. They are objects with 50 hit points, an AC of 16, and resistance to all damage except for thunder and bludgeoning damage. They are immune to psychic and poison damage.<br>
When a pillar is destroyed, each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 17 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (creature's choice). On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 12), it is also buried in rubble. A buried creature is restrained, and it or another creature must use an action to make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) to free it. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone or buried. A Huge or larger creature has advantage on the saving throw. The area within 10 feet of the destroyed pillar also becomes difficult terrain.
* **Mountainside.** The sides of the mountain are extremely steep, and only creatures with a climb speed can move across them effectively. If a creature is dropped or knocked prone in this area, it will continue to fall and roll down the cliff for 100 feet off the map, taking 100 feet worth of fall damage before landing on a ledge.

* <font color="Purple">**Purple Numbers:** Entrances for Invoker Reinforcements </font>
* **I:** Ape Invoker Starting Location


### Running the Encounter
The battle will start with three ape invokers chanting wildly. You can use these invokers for role-play purposes, having them taunt the players about the titanic ape and boast that nothing can stop them. On initiative count 20 of the round after the battle with the invokers starts, the titanic ape will enter the plaza through the massive double doors at the top of the map carrying a Large rock it can use with its fling ability. Have it roll for initiative for that round (if it rolls a 20 or higher, have it immediately take its turn.)


#### Titanic Ape
The titanic ape uses the same general tactics described in its own document (these can be found at the end of this document) but without wasting any time trying to scare off the players. It immediately goes all out on the first turn of combat. When choosing where to throw a player, the ape will consider throwing them into the pillars to destroy them, burying the thrown target and any nearby creatures. The ape fights to the death, driven by frenzy and without regard for the safety of its worshipers.

\pagebreakNum

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Ape Invokers 
The ape invokers are completely devoted to their titanic god and have no fear of death. They prioritize attacking players that the ape can't easily reach using javelins or targeting those who are concentrating on spells that restrain the ape. They always attempt to use their Apetagonize ability whenever possible, even if it risks being hit by the ape's Reverberating Slam right after the tantrum triggers.

***New Invokers.*** On initiative count 20 of every other turn after combat starts, have a new ape invoker arrive at one of the map's 4 entrances at random, then roll initiative for it (if it rolls a 20 or higher, have it immediately take its turn.)

### Aftermath
This is a fight to the death for the titanic ape and its worshippers, and they will not flee the mountain summit. If the players flee, they will give chase until the players manage to reach an area the ape can't follow. The ape invokers will be unlikely to continue the pursuit without the aid of the ape.

If the players slay the titanic ape, no new invokers will join the fight as they all flee the mountain in terror.


#### Loot
After the battle, the players will be able to enter the ape's chamber and plunder all the offerings it received from its worshippers. Because this battle is likely to be the final encounter of an adventure, it would be a good time to award the players one or two treasure hoards of the appropriate level.

#### XP Award: 30,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the titanic ape and its worshippers can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the titanic ape without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the titanic ape, but one or more of their party members were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** If the players find a way to defeat the ape without killing it or putting an end to the threat it posses for good, you can award them half the XP.
* **10% XP:** The players flee.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 10-12).** Reduce the titanic ape's hit points to 297 and have it appear three rounds after combat starts rather than one round. Additionally, don't have any new ape invokers appear throughout the battle, and seal entrances 2 and 3 on the map so they no longer function as exits. Change the XP award to 15,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 18-20).** Increase the titanic ape's hit points to 597. Additionally, have a new ape invoker appear every round after combat starts rather than every other round. Change the XP award to 45,000XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Remnants of the Cult.** While the immediate threat was neutralized, not all cultists were present at the mountain temple. The remaining members, desperate and vengeful, start gathering new followers and search for a new monstrous deity to worship and control. The adventurers must root out the rest of the cult and stop their new sinister plan. |
|  2  | **Rise of the Titans.** The titanic ape was one of many ancient monsters being awoken by the cult, and the players must track down the other locations around the world where these primordial threats are being raised to prevent them from being unleashed. |
|  3  | **The Lost City.** The battle with the titanic ape revealed the entrance to a lost city buried within the mountain. The remaining cultists have fled into this city in pursuit of their cryptic goals. |
|  4  | **Nature's Reclaim.** The awakening of the titanic ape has caused the area around the mountain temple to start growing at an unnatural rate, turning into a wild and magical jungle. The rapidly expanding jungle threatens to engulf nearby settlements and must be stopped. |
