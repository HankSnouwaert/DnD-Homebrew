# Mountain Navigation
Mountains are among the most hazardous environments for overland travel. Unless there are established paths, they are almost entirely made up of rough terrain filled with hidden dangers. They are difficult to navigate, provide few resources, and host unpredictable weather. Travelers who venture too high will be exposed to brutally cold winds and thin air, and those who become lost risk stumbling into the lair of a mountain-dwelling monster. Still, adventurers often choose to risk mountain travel to attempt a shortcut on their journey, face foes dwelling among the peaks, or to simply challenge themselves to ascend to the roof of the world.

## Travel Activities
When the players travel long distances overland, mountains can be a significant challenge in their journey. You may modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players travel through mountains.

### Travel Pace
If the players are traveling through mountains without the aid of a relatively smooth trail, it is considered rough terrain unless they have a climb speed. This is the case even if the players are traveling down the mountain slope. If the players have to scale difficult cliff faces, you may even treat the travel as though they are climbing through difficult terrain, which would reduce their travel speed to ¼ the usual pace.

### Navigation
Mountains can be challenging to navigate, and the DMG suggests a navigation DC of around 15 for most mountain ranges. 

\columnbreak


<br><br>


If the players can climb a peak with an advantageous view of the landscape, you can give them advantage on their check. Players in low valleys or ravines will likely have disadvantage on navigation attempts if they have no landmarks to gauge their progress against.

### Foraging
Mountains tend to have little to no natural resources at higher altitudes. In the alpine zone, the foraging DC should be 20 or higher. At lower altitudes with vegetation, it is usually easier to find food and water.

### Belaying
There may be situations where the players are scaling a cliff together using ropes and climbing equipment. They may opt to use the practice of belaying up the cliff as a safety precaution. This involves one player climbing up a short distance while attached to a rope secured to a piton hammered into the mountainside below and securing a rope into the cliff face with another piton. A player below who is attached to this rope can then remove the first piton and climb to catch up with the first player while secured by the piton they just hammered into the mountain. This process repeats throughout the climb, and in this way, no one is ever climbing without being secured by a rope to a piton a short distance down.

If a player who is belaying falls while climbing, the rope their partner attached can catch their fall. If you wish to introduce the possibility of a belay not being secured properly and thus being yanked out by the force of the fall, you can have the player who secured the belay make a Dexterity (Survival) check to see how well the rope was secured. Set the DC to be 5 less than the DC required to climb the cliff. On a success, the rope holds, and the falling player is saved. On a failure, the rope wasn't secured properly, and the player continues to plummet.

## Mountain Hazards
Mountains are among the most hazardous natural environments. Extreme cold, strong wind, heavy precipitation, high altitude, and slippery ice are all common mountain hazards described in the DMG (pg. 110). Other hazards include falling debris, sudden drops, and unpredictable weather. 

### Avalanches & Rockslides
These events are triggered by small cascades of debris that knock other debris loose, starting a chain reaction that results in large waves, snow, or earth barreling down a mountainside. The speed, size, save DC imposed on creatures, and damage inflicted by these events depends on their severity and materials.
When one of these events occurs, all creatures near its path must roll intiative. The wave of debris travels its move speed twice each round, on intiative counts 10 and 0, and continues moving this way for as long as it's able. When the debris moves, any creature in its space moves along with it and falls prone before making a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes an amount of bludgeoning damage determined by the size category of the falling debris, and on a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

When the debris stops, it settles and buries any creatures in its space. A creature buried this way is blinded, restrained, and has total cover. The creature gains 1 level of exhaustion for every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig itself free as an action by making a Strength check against the DC of the event. It has advantage on this check if it has a burrow speed. On a success, the creature breaks up through the surface, ending the blinded and restrained condition on itself. A creature that fails this check three times can't attempt to dig itself out again. 

A creature that is not buried in the debris can spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature if it knows approximately where it is in the debris.

Creatures can't be buried by the debris if their size is larger than the event's Depth (see the table below). They also can't be carried along by the sliding debris if their size is two sizes larger than the Depth of the event. (Example: A Size Category 2 event can't bury a creature that's Large or larger and can't move a creature that's Huge or larger.)

#### Avalanches
These events are primarily made up of cascading snow. Their speed equals the roll of a number of d4s equal to their size category times 100ft. Regardless of their severity, their damage is always 1d10 bludgeoning damage.

#### Rock Slides
These events are primarily made up of cascading rocks, boulders, and dirt. Their speed is 3d4 times 50ft. Their damage equals the roll of a number of d10s equal to <br> their size category. 

\columnbreak



##### Avlanche & Rock Slide Sizes and DC
|      Size Category       | Hazard DC |  Size: <br> Length |  Size: <br> Width | Size: Depth | 
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:| 
|           1         |         10      |         1d12x10ft.          |         1d4x10ft.          | Small
|           2         |         15         |          (1d6+4)x30ft.          |         2d6x10ft.          | Medium
|           3         |         20         |           (1d8+2)x300ft.    |        1d10x100ft.          | Large
|           4         |         25          |        1d4/2 Miles          |         1d4x1,000ft.          | Huge
|           5         |         30         |        1d4x2 Miles         |         1d4/2 Miles          | Gargantuan



##### Isolated Debris

If there are a few rocks or boulders falling rather than an entire rock slide, have characters in its path make a Dexterity save against the Hazard DC. On a failed save, they take 2d10 bludgeoning damage per Size Category, are pushed 5 feet per Size Category, and are knocked prone. On a successful save, they dodge the rocks, take no damage, and are not pushed or knocked prone. Pass or fail, the rocks pass by or shatter, and the creatures are not moved any further.

> ##### Growing Events
> Avalanches and rockslides often start as small events that pick up speed and size as they progress. Most of the time, this won't be important to note when players encounter them. But, if you need to track the progress of the event, you can have its size category increase by 1 for every few rounds it travels and increase its stats accordingly,

### Steep Falls
Mountains are filled with cliffs and sudden drops. Most will be easily visible to players and won't need to be mentioned as they travel. However, if the players are unable to see a drop for any reason, or there is combat or some other dangerous event that risks pushing players off a drop, it may become necessary to determine its height. 
It may be convenient to brake these drops up into general sizes.

**Small Falls:** These are the most numerous drops, ranging in the 10s of feet, and many mountain encounters will feature at least one or two of these drops. You can make their height **1d10x10ft.**

**Medium Falls:** These are much more severe drops, reaching hundreds of feet. They will be more notable hazards during the players' journey. You can make their height **1d4x100ft.**

**Large Falls:** These are the largest of drops, reaching thousands of feet. Many mountains won't have any drops this extreme, and they make for dramatic highlights in the environment. You can make their height **1d8x500ft**.

You can add falls throughout the players' mountain journey when you feel it's appropriate and use the sizes that best fit the type of mountain environment they're traveling through. 

\columnbreak

#### Hidden Falls
Snow and ice can conceal sudden drops in a similar way to pit traps. Cornices are structures made of snow that hang over cliff edges, hiding where solid land ends. Creatures that step on them risk falling through and over the cliff edge. Other times, snow and thin ice will cover deep crevasses, hiding them from view until a creature falls through.
##### Spotting Falls
Rather than using passive Perception to spot hidden falls, you may opt to use the passive Survival of any characters keeping a lookout. The DC to spot the fall can be anywhere from 10 (barely hidden falls) to 30 (supernaturally hidden falls). You can pick what's appropriate for your environment or roll to determine one randomly.
##### Falling Through
If a creature doesn't spot the fall and falls through, it can make a Dexterity save to try to catch a ledge and prevent the fall. The DC of this save depends on the nature of the fall. A relatively narrow crag may only have a DC 10. A large cornice stretching out from a ledge covered in cursed ice may have a DC 30. This save DC can be independent of the DC to spot the fall, and you can pick one you feel is appropriate to the situation or roll to determine it randomly.

If a creature fails to grab a ledge, it falls the full length of the cliff or crevasse.

### Weather
Mountain weather is more unpredictable, changeable, and extreme than in the lowlands. This is particularly true in the higher alpine zones.
As the players travel through mountainous areas, you can roll on the following tables at each time of day to determine the wind and precipitation levels. The afternoon tends to have the most extreme weather variance and has its own tables.



##### Weather
|      d20             |     Wind (Morning, Evening, Night)     |
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|           1-12         |         Light          |
|           13-18      |         Strong          | 
|           19-20      |         Violent          |

|           8-14      |         Strong          | 
|           15-20     |         Violent          |

|           16-17      |         Lightning           | 
|           18-19      |        Heavy Rain/Snow          | 
|           20     |         Heavy Rain/Snow With Lightning          |


\columnbreak

|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|           1-7         |         None          |

|           17-20     |         Heavy Rain/Snow With Lightning          |



> ##### Mountain Temperature
> Mountains have extreme temperature drops between night and day when there are clear skies, partly because the sun's rays are more intense at higher altitudes. The average temperature also drops by about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 ft. of elevation gain (about 18-19 degrees per mile). There's no exact science to determining the temperature at any given time, but you can keep these factors in mind when determining the level of cold the players are facing.


#### Fog
Fog can be heavy or light. You can roll a d6 to determine the type of fog. On a roll of 1-4, it’s light fog, and on a roll of 5-6, it’s heavy fog. 

Light fog lightly obscures terrain and imposes disadvantage on checks that rely on sight. Heavy fog completely obscures terrain and makes checks that rely on sight impossible. 

Cliffs and crevasses that would have been obvious can become hidden falls in any type of fog (see the Hidden Falls section).

If there are heavy or violent winds present, the fog will be less likely to stay in the area for long and may pass more quickly.

\pagebreakNum

#### Lightning
Storms are especially dangerous in mountainous environments where the odds of being struck by lightning are significantly higher. When a storm approaches the players' location, and you wish to add the possibility of them being struck by lightning, you can roll periodically to determine if there will be a lightning strike at their location.

Periodically roll 1d20 to determine if there will be a lightning strike in the area. Rolling this way keeps the threat of lightning unpredictable. How often you make this check depends on how often you want lightning to threaten the players. Below are some suggested frequencies.

**Sparse Lightning:** Roll Every 30 Minutes<br>
&emsp;**Frequent Lightning:** Roll Every 10 Minutes<br>
&emsp;**Dense Lightning:** Roll Every 1 Minute



The result of your roll determines whether there is a lightning strike. You can determine what result is needed based on how much of the storm is centered on the players' location. Below are some suggested ranges.

| Proximity of Storm  | Result Needed for Lighting to Strike In Area |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Distant  | 16+ |
|  Nearby  | 11+ |
|  Centered on Players  | 6+ |



\columnbreak

If the lightning is striking in their proximity, each player rolls a d20, and you roll a d20 for each NPC creature. Creatures who roll low enough based on their size are potential targets for lightning. Creatures wearing metal, wielding large metal objects, or in bodies of water have disadvantage on this roll. Creatures who are prone and not in bodies of water have advantage. 

You can use the table below to determine who is a target for the lightning strike.

##### Lighting Strike Check Table
| Creature Size  | Result Needed to Be Struck |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Tiny  | 1 |
|  Small  | 5 or Less |
|  Medium  | 10 or Less |
|  Large  | 14 or Less |
|  Huge  | 17 or Less |
|  Gargantuan  | 19 or Less |


If multiple creatures roll low enough to be struck, the tallest creature among them is struck. This height includes standing on an elevated surface.

If no creature rolls the result needed to be struck, the lightning strikes a surface nearby in a flash of light accompanied by a resounding boom, warning everyone of the near miss they just had.

If a creature is struck by lightning, it takes 3d10 lightning damage, and each creature in a 15-foot cube centered on the struck creature is subjected to the effects of the *thunderwave* spell (DC 15).

#### Rain, Snow, or Hail 
Heavy precipitation, such as rain and snow, is described on page 110 of the DMG. However, hail storms are also more likely in mountainous environments, and if you wish to add them as a possible hazard, you can use the following mechanics to represent them.

##### Hail

Each creature out in the open of a hail storm at the start of its turn must make Constitution save. Creatures not wearing armor have disadvantage on this save, and creatures wearing heavy armor have advantage. A creature takes an amount of bludgeoning and cold damage determined by the size of the hail on a failed save, and half as much damage on a success.


|      Hail Size      | Hail Save DC |  Damage |  
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|           Modest (Grape-Sized)         |         10      |        1d6 Bludgeoning & 1d4 Cold           | 
|           Large  (Orange-Sized)       |         15         |          2d6 Bludgeoning & 2d4 Cold          | 
|           Huge (Coconut-Sized)        |         20         |           3d6 Bludgeoning & 3d4 Cold    |   
|           Massive (Melon-Sized)        |         25         |           4d6 Bludgeoning & 4d4 Cold    |   
|           Supernatural  (Large Watermelon-Sized)       |         30         |           5d6 Bludgeoning & 5d4 Cold    |   

You can have hail storms appear when you feel it fits the game or roll for them to randomly replace other types of precipitation 1/6th of the time.

#### Winds
Rules for strong winds are described on page 110 of the DMG. If you wish to make your winds particularly hazardous, you can modify them in the following ways; the save DCs and severity of the effects these winds have are determined by the Wind Severity table.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



##### Extreme Cold
This wind carries a chill that cuts to the core. For every 1 minute a creature without cold resistance spends in the wind, it must make a Constitution save. On a failure, the creature takes an amount of cold damage dependent on the severity of the cold, and on a pass, it takes half as much damage. Creatures with insulating fur or clothing have advantage on this save.

##### Sudden Gusts
This wind will unexpectedly pick up gusts capable of bowling over creatures. At the start of every round of combat with this wind, roll 1d6. On a result of 5 or 6, all creatures not behind at least half cover are subjected to the effects of the *gust of wind* spell, except the distance they are moved on a failed save is dependent on the severity of the wind. 

If the players aren't in combat, this wind will greatly hamper travel for those not behind cover and make traveling near ledges very dangerous. If players are traveling for an extended period of time through an open area subjected to sudden gusts, have each of them make a Strength save for each hour of travel. On a success, they are able to push through the winds, and on a failure, they treat the terrain areas as though it's rough terrain while they struggle to fight against the winds. If the terrain is already rough terrain, creatures can only move through it at 1/4th the speed. 

##### Wind Severity
|      Wind Severity      | Wind Save DC |  Cold Damage |  Gust Push Distance | 
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|           Mild         |         10      |        1d8          |         5ft.          | 
|           Moderate         |         15         |          2d8          |         5ft.          | 
|           Intense         |         20         |           4d8    |        10ft.          | 
|           Extreme         |         25          |        6d8          |         10ft.          |
|           Supernatural         |         30         |        8d8         |         15ft.          |

## Example Random Encounter Tables
The following are different mountain environments across varying levels of gameplay, complete with random encounter tables you can use when the players are traversing them.  You can plug these right into your games, modify them to better suit your campaign, or simply use them as inspiration for creating and running your own river encounters.

Each mountain range has a DC determining its foraging difficulty and an activity level suggesting how often to roll for a random encounter.  Creature names with asterisks have new stat blocks listed at the end of the document. There is also some information on the types of weather events likely to happen in these environments and what their DC range should be.

Not every encounter is meant to be a fight the players should be forced into. If the players are on the lower end of the level range, some of the encounters might be overwhelming for them, and they should have the option to attempt to avoid combat through other interactions, hiding, or fleeing. You can avoid encounters that seem like they wouldn't fit the current situation or modify them as needed.

### Howling Ridge (Level 1-4)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 4 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 20 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 10 (15 without roads or markers) <br>
**Weather DC:**  Save DCs for weather events range from 10-15.

This mountain passed was once considered relatively safe and well-traveled. The paths through it are well-worn and marked to make the pass as navigable as possible. However, things took a turn for the worst when a werewolf pack moved into the area and, over the course of just a few nights, slaughtered an entire convoy of settlers making their way through the pass to start a new life on the other side. This act of brutality cursed the mountain ridge and earned it its new name. Since then, the pack has mostly disbanded into lone werewolves or, at most, very small packs who continue to stalk the mountain paths for foolhardy travelers. The mountain's curse ensures that those who die here can find no peace, and the pass is filled with roaming undead who occasionally even attempt to enact vengeance against the murderous werewolves.

These primordial jungle mountains are home to many overgrown temples and roads built by the lizardmen in ages past. The lizardmen recently moved an expeditionary force into these ruins to begin restoring them for reoccupation. Many bands of gorillas who made these ruins their home were driven out in the process. 

Unfortunately for the lizardmen, these apes have deeper ties to the land than they'd realized, and they seemed to have formed into an intelligent fighting force capable of performing hit-and-run attacks against their reptilian foes. The gorilla troops seem to have been unified by a mighty titanic ape that has arisen from its long slumber to lead the simian army against lizardmen.

### The Ashen Crags (Level 11-16)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 3 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 25 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 20 <br>
**Weather:** Save DCs for weather events range from 20-25.


These barren mountains were once home to active volcanos and chaos dwarf workshops. The dwarves lost their holdings to a laborer uprising, and the volcanos have become dormant. The wreckage of old machinery remains, along with roaming constructs, no longer bound to their dwarven creators. Recently, the chaos dwarves have begun sending expeditionary forces to the crags to determine if their old territory can be reclaimed. 

However, their practice of capturing demons to bind within their machines is now coming back to bite them, for many fiends once held within the abandoned workshops have broken free and now prey on any who enter the crags. There are even scattered reports that one or more daemon princes may be in the area, attempting to rally a small fiendish army.

These mountains were once part of the ancient empire of the giants. Since the collapse of their empire, it has been occupied by different tribes of warring yetis. The more savage yetis will attack other creatures on sight and are ruthless hunters. The enlightened meh-teh yetis are at war with their savage kin and will ally with humanoids who have proven their worth. Other massive predators hunt the yetis and any other travelers they find. Recently, giants have begun reappearing in their old territory, and they seem to view all yetis as unwelcome pests in their homes that must be purged.
