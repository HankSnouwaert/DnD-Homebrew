## Condors
Condors are among the largest flying birds in the world, often reaching lengths of up to 4.5 feet and sporting wingspans that can reach up to 10 feet. Their appearance is similar to that of vultures, with feathers that are a mix of black and other colors and heads and necks devoid of feathers. 

Condors are known for their extraordinary flight abilities. They use thermal updrafts to soar and glide through the air, often for hours, without flapping their wings. This helps them conserve energy as they soar at heights of up to 15,000 feet. They have a keen eyesight which allows them to spot potential food from high altitudes.
Condors are scavengers, feeding mostly on the carcasses of dead animals. They play an important role in their ecosystems by helping to get rid of decaying matter. Their extremely strong stomach acid helps them digest this carrion, which can include bones, without getting sick.

These large birds are incredibly adaptable, being able to endure the harsh conditions of high mountain peaks as well as rugged badland cliffs. Condors often feature prominently in the legends of mountain dwelling humanoid tribes. Their ability to soar among the mountain tops is associated with a divine status, and many consider condors messengers serving the gods on high.

Condors seldom have any reason to attack humanoids unless threatened. However, mountain dwelling druids or gods associated with condors may use them as sentries among the peaks. Such condors may even be persuaded to attack intruders with beak and claw. Though they will usually wait until their foes are distracted by other combatants or on dangerous high terrain before they make their attack.

## Argentavis
Argentavis is an ancient species of bird and thought to be one of the largest flying birds that has ever lived. Its body reaches 12 feet in length, and its massive wingspan stretches out to 20 feet. This colossal bird, as mighty as it is magnificent, relies heavily on thermal soaring for flight. Like the smaller condor cousins, the argentavis capitalizes on the warm, rising air currents to traverse vast distances, flapping its enormous wings sparingly to conserve energy. Its takeoff, a display of raw power and agility, involves a wind-assisted run combined with a leaping motion, showcasing the bird's impressive leg strength.

Yet, the argentavis is not just an accomplished aviator, but a ruthless scavenger. The large, hooked beak, reminiscent of an executioner's blade, is perfectly adapted for tearing into the flesh of the fallen. When the argentavis descends onto a carcass, other scavengers are wise to yield, for contesting the massive bird’s claim could invite the wrath of its razor-sharp talons.

Many believe agentavis to be long extinct, leaving behind only fossils and ancient legends. However, some believe they still soar within primeval mountains cut off from civilization, feasting on the remains of mighty beasts and would-be explorers. Others believe those that remain act in service of demi-gods who rule their domains from the highest peaks.

#### Dread Argentavis
Though the argentavis is assumed to be the largest “natural” bird to have lived, some believe that an even larger variant referenced in ancient legends may still exist. Referred to as the dread argentavis, this massive creature does indeed soar over long forgotten mountain ranges, its shadow casting an ominous pall over the landscape below. 

As wide as a longship's sail and black as onyx, its wings spread across the sky, a silent and foreboding symbol of power. This colossal avian creature, standing taller than the mightiest warhorse and with a wingspan greater than 30 feet, is the stuff of legends.

The dread argentavis, also known as the "Titan of the Skies", possesses a fearsome visage. Its glossy black feathers shimmer in the sunlight as it soars effortlessly on thermal currents. A large hooked beak is perfect for tearing apart carrion or intimidating potential rivals. Its eyes, like twin orbs of polished obsidian, are sharp and discerning, capable of spotting a rabbit scurrying in the underbrush from thousands of feet above.

However, the dread argentavis, for all its might, does not prey on the living. It is the ultimate scavenger, preferring to feed upon the carcasses of fallen beasts. Its deadly beak an massive talons are used to drive off other creatures that would challenge its right to the carrion of its choice, and many headstrong adventurers have suffered the consequences of challenging the dread argentavis’s claims.

### Zheng Loot
The valuable items looted from zheng will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Zheng Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
