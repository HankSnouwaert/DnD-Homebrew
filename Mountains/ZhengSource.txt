## Zheng

Deep within the mountains, there lies a terror to those who dare to traverse the dangerous peaks and ridges: the Zheng. Resembling a large, muscular feline, the Zheng is roughly the size of a tiger with a coat of bristling fur that helps it blend into its mountainous home. Its body is as hard as the granite it treads, honed by years of life in the rugged terrain. At the end of its muscular body, multiple sinuous tails sway and twitch, each one capable of lashing and snapping with the force of a wicked whip.

But the creature's most chilling feature is its horn, a formidable, twisted spike of bone, gleaming deadly sharp. It protrudes from its forehead, wreathed by its wild mane, an ever-ready weapon to impale its unsuspecting prey.

The Zheng is a creature of cunning and malice, choosing to hide and stalk its victims from the cover of dense mountain fog or among the fallen rocks. With a burst of speed that belies its size, it will descend upon travelers like a landslide, its horn aimed to impale. Its tails serve as added weapons, whipping out to lash and distract foes, or sweep them off balance.

The creature's cruel, hook-like claws and sharp teeth are capable of shredding through armor and flesh alike, adding a gruesome end to its victims. Its hunting prowess is unparalleled, with its exceptional hearing and keen sight allowing it to pick out the smallest of movements in the mountainous terrain.

The Zheng is a solitary hunter, and its haunting cries echoing through the mountains are a chilling reminder to all who hear them: no one is safe in the Zheng's territory.

### Zheng Mountain Breakers
It is said that if a zheng lives long enough, it can establish a deeper connection with its mountainous home, allowing it to grow in power and gain a newfound supremecy over its environment. These zheng are known as mountain breakers and are far more formidable than its common kin. The mountains imbue them with vitality and their horns often grow to increased prominence. But it is their roars which undergo the most terrifying change. 

The zheng mountain breaker’s terrifying roar is not just a call of dominance, but a weapon of incredible power. When it bellows, the sheer force of the sound triggers tremors that reverberate through the mountain, causing rockslides and avalanches. It uses these cataclysms to bury and crush its prey, making escape nearly impossible.

With its prey trapped under the weight of the mountain, the mountain breaker descends from the peak, leaping from boulder to boulder with an agility that belies its massive size. It impales survivors on its horn and uses its tails to sweep away any remnants of resistance.

Many legends tell of its terrifying presence. The few who have survived its attacks speak of the mountains trembling under its roar, the air growing still with an ominous sense of doom before the landslide hits. Others recall the cold dread of being buried alive, only to see the beast's glowing eyes descending upon them in the darkness.

### Zheng Summit Sovereign

Even above the formidable zheng mountain breaker exists a being of furious power and terror, a creature whose legend is whispered with awe and fear among those who dare to climb the high, frozen peaks. It is known as the zheng summit sovereign, the frost-bound monarch of the world's highest, harshest realms.

The zheng summit sovereign is a hulking creature, its powerful body as large as a grizzly bear’s. Its pelt, as icy white as its fridged home, is coarse and long, providing a natural barrier against the harsh, freezing winds of the icy mountains. The summit sovereign's formidable antler-like horn and multiple tails with iron-hard barbs are encrusted in a layer of eternal frost.
Its roar is a sound not just of power but of calamity, its booming echoes triggering not just landslides, but whole glacial shifts. Entire ice sheets are dislodged by its calls, crashing down in a terrifying avalanche that buries and freezes its prey.

Most terrifying, however, are its claws and teeth. They're not only sharp as a dragon's but infused with a supernatural, freezing cold. A single scratch can cause frostbite, and a bite inflicts a creeping, icy doom into the victim's body, freezing them from the inside out.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

The origin of summit sovereigns remains shrouded in mystery. Ancient scrolls offer conflicting theories, with some suggesting they are the result of crossbreeding between a zheng and a frost saber leopard. Others speak of epic battles fought atop frozen mountains, where the victorious zheng gains mastery over the mountain and undergoes a transformation, becoming a summit sovereign.

Summit sovereigns make their lairs in the crevices of ice-encrusted peaks, areas so inhospitable that they are virtually untouched by outsiders. Their arrival is often heralded by a chilling wind that sweeps the peak, and an ominous quiet that blankets the area.

Stories abound of climbers who ventured too high, only to be trapped in a sudden, unexpected avalanche. When the rescuers finally dug out their bodies, they found them frozen solid, bearing horrifying claw and bite marks that glowed with an otherworldly frost.

Despite their dread-inducing reputation, the Zheng Glacial Monarchs are considered a living embodiment of the frozen wilderness, the harsh, relentless, yet awe-inspiring spirit of the high peaks. Their existence, as horrifying as it is, is a grim reminder of the unforgiving laws of nature in these extreme climates.

If the avalanche moves through a creature's space, that creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (creature's choice).

While buried, the creature is restrained and requires a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape, a creature has advantage on this check if it has a burrow speed. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or buried.

### Zheng Tactics
Zheng are skilled ambush predators, choosing to strike when they have the element of surprise or when their target is isolated. If they find themselves in a disadvantageous situation, they will retreat and regroup to re-engage later with the advantage. Once zheng successfully ambush their prey and enter combat, they will not hesitate to retreat if the tide of the fight turns against them. This is especially true if they fail to knock their target prone, secure them in a grapple, or if their own health drops below half.
#### Mountain Breaker
Mountain breakers initiate their ambushes by using their Landslide ability on their intended prey before taking the Hide action as a bonus action. If a mountain breaker successfully hits multiple targets with its Landslide, it prioritizes attacking buried targets. It utilizes dashes and bonus action Hides to launch surprise attacks from different angles if it can stay hidden while doing so. If the combat conditions becomes unfavorable, the mountain breaker will retreat.
#### Summit Sovereign
The summit sovereign employs most of the same tactics as the mountain shaker. However, if a target succumbs to the icy effects of its bite, the summit sovereign is more likely to remain engaged in the battle to ensure the incapacitated can be finished off.

### Zheng Loot
The valuable items looted from zheng will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Zheng Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
