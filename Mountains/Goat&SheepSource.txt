## Goats & Sheep

### Bighorn Sheep

Bighorn Sheep, named for the large, curved horns carried by the males or 'rams', are impressive animals that dwell in mountainous and desert regions. The rams' horns are particularly notable, coiling back from the forehead and down around the ears, with some reaching lengths of over 30 inches. Females, or "ewes", are smaller in size and have shorter, less curved horns. Their coloration ranges from light brown to grayish or dark, chocolate brown, with a distinguishing white belly and rump patch.

Known for their agility and grace, Bighorn Sheep are expert climbers. They have an uncanny ability to traverse steep and rocky terrains, with their specialized cloven hooves providing an excellent grip. They are particularly adept at leaping great distances, a useful skill in the rocky and treacherous habitats they call home.

However, rams are best known for their intense battles for dominance, charging at each other with their impressive horns. These charges, which can reach speeds up to 20 miles per hour, result in a crash that echoes through the mountains, indicating that a contest for dominance is underway. 

The strength of a bighorn sheep should not be underestimated, particularly in the case of the ram's powerful charge. Their adept ability to navigate their steep, rocky home makes them a difficult animal to pursue. Therefore, engaging with these majestic beasts calls for considerable caution. 

***Dire Bighorns.*** The dire bighorn is a species of giant ram capable of living in extremely harsh mountain environments. Far outsizing other mundane mountain creatures, this ram can deliver bone shattering blows with its skull. This combined with their mountain climbing agility, deters almost all other mountain creatures from attempting to hunt them. Mountain dwarves will often use captured dire bighorns for agricultural use and as fearsome and dependable mounts when traversing their rocky homes.

### Domestic Goats

The domestic goat, one of the oldest tamed livestock species, is a ubiquitous symbol of rural life across the world. A typical domestic goat stands around two feet tall at the shoulder, though larger breeds can reach three feet or more. Their bodies are covered in a variety of coats, ranging from smooth hair to luxuriant cashmere wool. 

Domestic goats are hardy, adaptable creatures, capable of surviving in a wide range of environments. This adaptability, coupled with their usefulness, has led to their spread around the world. They provide milk, meat, and wool, and in many cultures, they hold significant symbolic or religious importance.

In folklore and myth, goats often play interesting roles. They are sometimes seen as symbols of stubbornness, independence, and fertility. In many cultures, they are linked with pastoral deities or earthy, rustic magic. 

Despite their independent nature, goats are generally sociable creatures, forming close bonds with their keepers and other livestock. They are known for their curiosity and intelligence, and anyone who has spent time around goats can attest to their playful and mischievous behavior.

### Mountain Goats
Mountain goats are nimble creatures that dwell in high alpine regions. Their striking white coats contrast against the rocky terrain they are often found in. Both males and females sport black, dagger-like horns, which can reach up to 10 inches long and provide them with formidable natural weapons. 

Despite their name and appearance, mountain goats are not true goats but are more closely related to cattle, gazelles, and antelopes. They don’t possess the same reinforced skulls of goats and, as such, don’t use ramming attacks. Instead, they utilize deadly piercing attacks from their horns, which can be deadly to creatures as large as bears. 

Mountain goats have specialized hooves built for navigating precarious cliffs and rocky slopes. They are able to run up and down sheer cliffs with ease, traversing areas impassable to other creatures. This adaptation, combined with incredible jumping capabilities, gives them a significant advantage in rough terrain, making them difficult creatures to chase or escape from.

Mountain goats can be quite aggressive and formidable adversaries. Males in mating season are prone to being belligerent, but even female mountain goats can be so hostile that males will avoid them when not looking to mate. This, combined with superior climbing abilities, powerful leaps, and impressive horn attacks, make them deadly adversaries in their natural environment.

### Terror Goat 
Beyond the realm of ordinary fauna, in the harshest and most forsaken corners of the mountain ranges, lurks a beast of nightmare and legend, the terror goat. It's not a creature merely born of the wild, but a monstrosity formed from raw, unbridled terror, its very existence a testament to nature's more savage and merciless aspects.

The terror goat is an anomaly among its kin, a grotesque and exaggerated silhouette of the typical mountain goat. It is enormous in size, standing well over ten feet tall at the shoulder, a hulking brute whose mere presence strikes fear into the hearts of both beasts and men alike. Its hide is a mottled gray, as hard and rough as the stones of its mountain home. Yet, it is the creature's skull that is its most terrifying feature. Formed of solid rock, it is a cruel parody of a normal goat's head. Its beady eyes shine with malice, and its skull sports a pair of massive, jagged stone horns that gleam with an ominous luster.

The terror goat is the embodiment of primal fear and aggression. Its rocky skull is a formidable weapon, though it leaves little room for a brain and renders the beast incredibly dim-witted. It charges mindlessly at any perceived threat and can smash through solid stone and demolish structures with frightening ease. The beast seems to be waging an endless well of mindless aggression, attacking with a reckless abandon that terrifies even the bravest of warriors. Whether it is attacking creatures, objects, or structures, the terror goat relentlessly smashes until nothing is left.


Local mountain tribes speak of the terror goat in hushed whispers, a cautionary tale to those who would disturb the unforgiving wilderness. They believe that it was born from the mountain's wrath itself, a manifestation of nature's unchecked fury. It is said that merely being near the terror goat is enough to induce a profound, mortal terror, a dread so deep that it can break even the stoutest heart.

### Goat & Sheep Adventure Hooks

| d8  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Raging Ram:** A particularly aggressive bighorn ram has been causing chaos, attacking travelers, and disrupting trade routes. The adventurers are tasked with calming or relocating the animal without causing it harm, requiring a combination of combat prowess, nature skills, and animal handling.|
|  2  |**The Beast in Sheep's Clothing:** Strange tales emerge from a mountain village about a monstrous creature disguising itself as a bighorn sheep, only to reveal its terrifying form under the full moon's light. The adventurers are hired to uncover the truth behind these stories and neutralize the threat if necessary.  |
|  3 |  **The Mountain's Challenge:** An ancient tradition involves a contest to prove one's bravery by engaging in a friendly test of strength against the powerful dire bighorn sheep. However, this year, the chosen sheep, an unusually large and fierce ram, has gone missing. The adventurers are asked to find the ram and safely bring it back before the upcoming festival.  |

### Goats & Sheep Tactics
Goats and sheep are generally stubborn creatures and excel in one-on-one combat due to their Cranial Plating feature. If one becomes outnumbered or its opponent gains the advantage over it, it may attempt to flee to find its herd and gain safety in numbers. Goats and sheep with a climb speed will prefer to fight and flee in rocky terrain where they have the advantage and can flee more easily if need be.

Unless directed by a more intelligent creature, goats and sheep will use their Head Bash ability every turn until they miss, after which they will revert to regular attacks. A more intelligent creature may direct them to target enemies with lower AC, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit.

#### Mountain Goats
Mountain goats don’t have the Skull Bash or Cranial Plating abilities and instead rely on charging attacks with their horns. They will use their climbing and jumping abilities to outmaneuver foes in rocky terrain and get a running start to make skewering attacks whenever possible.


#### Terror Goats
Terror goats are even more belligerent, stubborn, and less intelligent than regular goats. They exhibit no fear, even when losing battles. Their malevolent nature means they will relentlessly pursue foes to the death, smashing through anything that gets in their way.

### Goat & Sheep Loot
The valuable items looted from goats and sheep will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. Because terror goats are partially stone, you may also allow players to make **Wisdom (Carver's Tools)** checks when harvesting them. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Goat & Sheep Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
