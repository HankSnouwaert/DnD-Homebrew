## Stonehorns

Resembling a monstrous, wholly predatory oxen, a stonehorn is a sight to behold. Its body is an impressive mass of hulking muscle, layered with rock-hard skin that is a cross between stone and hide. This natural armor protects the stonehorn from the biting cold of their frigid habitat, as well as the attacks of any who would dare to challenge them. Only the strongest of blows can damage its stony form, and slashing weapons ineffectually scrap against it.

The stonehorn's most notable feature is its massive pair of forward-curving horns. These are not mere bone but an extension of its stone-like hide, imbued with the strength of the mountains themselves. A charge from a stonehorn can level fortress walls or shatter a line of heavily armored warriors with horrifying ease.

These titanic beasts possess an insatiable appetite for eating not just flesh, but the very stone and earth itself. This unusual diet fuels the powerful magic that keeps these creatures alive in their hostile environment and helps to mend their bodies in the event of injury. This act of consuming stone also has an interesting side effect; over time, rocks, minerals, and even precious gems become embedded in a stonehorn's hide, making it even tougher.

In combat, stonehorns are terrifyingly powerful and nigh unstoppable, their charges akin to a landslide that decimates everything in its path. They can sense the presence of the precious gems they crave and will trample through everything in their path to reach their next meal. Foes who actually manage to significantly wound the stonehorn kindle an even greater fury within it, and the stonehorn will not cease the pursuit of the attackers until they have been splattered across the rocks.

As stonehorns age, more and more of their body gradually calcifies and turns to stone as it incorporates the minerals they consume throughout their long lifetime. Stonehorns near death seek out a secluded location where they fall into a deep hibernation until their body fully calcifies into an inert mass of stone.

Some powerful mountain races attempt to capture and break stonehorns for use as mounts and beasts of war. Most of these attempts are met with the would-be tamer meeting a violent and gory death. However, on the rare occasion that it succeeds, the hunter earns a mighty mount with no equal in their mountainous home. These stonehorn mounts are often sold for a hefty price to mountain warlords and chieftains, who use them as a status symbol and ride them into combat in times of war. Upon these unstoppable steeds, they are able to singlehandedly turn the tide of battle as they shatter enemy lines with the stonehorn’s near-unstoppable charge.

### Icehorns
In the harshest, most remote glacial regions, <br> where even the bravest explorers fear to tread, <br> dwell the legendary icehorns. They are a rare <br> and incredibly powerful variant of stonehorns, <br> adapted to the brutal cold and capable of  harnessing <br> the very ice and snow that permeates their unforgiving homeland.

Like stonehorns, icehorns feed on the minerals found <br> in their environment, but their diet is heavily supplemented with glacial ice and frost-encrusted rocks, infusing them <br> with potent cold magic. This grants them the ability to encase their already formidable bodies in a layer of magical ice. 

This is no mere frost, but a nearly impenetrable armor of solid, gleaming ice that is as hard as diamond. While encased in this icy armor, the icehorn's crystalline horns become even more lethal, capable of freezing and shattering opponents with a single blow.
However, this power does not come without a cost as the ice greatly slows their movements. They become lumbering, albeit unstoppable, fortresses of ice, reminiscent of a moving glacier, slow but unstoppable.

Interestingly, icehorns have complete control over this icy transformation. With a mighty shake, similar to a dog shedding water, an icehorn can shatter the icy armor encasing it, regaining its speed and agility. This ability to shift between a swift, powerful battering ram and an armored juggernaut makes icehorns incredibly unpredictable in battle.

### Stonehorn Tactics
When left to its own devices, the stonehorn relies on instinct, primarily driven by its insatiable appetite for precious metals and gems, which it consumes to nourish its earthen form. Thanks to its Treasure Sense ability, it identifies and charges at the creature holding the most valuable gems and gold, aiming to slaughter them by running them over repeatedly for maximum charge damage. When faced with multiple creatures possessing equal amounts of treasure, the stonehorn prefers targets adorned with the most metal. However, it shifts its attention towards any creature inflicting substantial damage (30 or more in a single turn), directing its Earth-Shattering Smash at that particular threat. The stonehorn instinctively utilizes its Stone Plating reaction against attacks it doesn’t have resistance to and that don’t have their damage reduced by its Stone Skeleton trait.

If under the guidance of a more intelligent creature, the stonehorn strategically focuses its attention on the largest group of creatures, charging at full speed from one target to another if they are spread out. The intelligent creatures guiding the stonehorn may also instruct it to reserve its Stone Plating reaction for high-damage single attacks from enemies like Paladins or Rogues, provided those attacks have a way to bypass its resistances.

#### Icehorn Tactics
The icehorn boasts a unique ability known as Glacial Stance, and understanding when to utilize this stance forms a critical part of its strategy. If the icehorn is not guided by an intelligent creature, it assumes the Glacial Stance whenever a creature comes within 20 feet, seeking to leverage the stance's higher defense.

When controlled by a more intelligent creature, the icehorn adopts the Glacial Stance whenever its enemies are reachable with melee attacks. If there are priority targets more than 20 feet away, the snow horn will exit its Glacial Stance to reach them.

The icehorn possesses two pairs of legendary actions whose use is dependent on whether it's in Glacial Stance:

**Frost Bite/Glacial Stomp:** The icehorn uses Glacial Stomp to crush a melee-range target that's drawn its attention. Conversely, Frost Bite targets solitary adversaries out of melee range, dealing moderate damage when it does not wish to waste time charging over to a new foe.

**Wild Shove/Trample:** The icehorn employs Wild Shove to position a target such that it can hit multiple creatures with its Earth-Shattering Smash or to create an escape route if it needs to withdraw from melee range. This tactic enables the Stonehorn to charge back and forth for devastating attacks without drawing opportunity attacks. Similarly, Trample is used to move toward a solitary target, stomp it, then return to the original position on its next turn for a full charge.

### Stonehorn Loot
The valuable items looted from stonehorns will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. Because stonehorns are filled with gems are partially stone, you may also allow players to make **Wisdom (Carver's Tools)** or **Wisdom (Jeweler's Tools)** checks when harvesting them. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Stonehorn Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
