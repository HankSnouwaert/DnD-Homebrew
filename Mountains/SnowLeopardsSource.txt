## Snow Leopards

The snow leopard, an elusive and majestic creature, is a medium-sized cat renowned for its striking coat of thick, white to smoky-gray fur, embellished with black spots and rosettes. Residing in the unforgiving mountain ranges, this creature is the epitome of endurance and grace. It possesses a robust body adapted for the harsh cold and rugged terrain, with wide, fur-covered feet that act as natural snowshoes and a long, furry tail for balance.

Snow leopards are solitary, nocturnal creatures with extraordinary climbing and leaping abilities, making them formidable hunters. They can easily cover vast distances, leaping up to 50 feet in a single bound. Despite their size, snow leopards are extraordinarily stealthy, using their camouflaging coat to blend into the rocky terrain and patiently stalk their prey.

Adapted for life in a cold, high altitude environment, they have smaller ears and a shorter muzzle to minimize heat loss, as well as large nasal cavities to warm the frigid air before it reaches their lungs. Their long, flexible tails not only aid in maintaining balance on narrow mountain ledges but also double as a cozy blanket, wrapping around their bodies to shield them from the cold.

Snow leopards are ambush hunters that prey on large mountain mammals of the mountains. Their agility enables them to navigate their rocky environment and quickly leap onto unsuspecting targets in the blink of an eye. Their physiology allows them to traverse many levels of mountain elevation in their search for their next meal, from alpine peaks to forested valleys. 

### Dire Snow Leopards
Dire snow leopards are a larger, more formidable variant of the ordinary snow leopard. Unlike their regular counterparts, Dire snow leopards can grow to the size of a small horse, while maintaining the agility and grace inherent to their species. They retain the solitary and nocturnal habits of their smaller kin. However, their physical prowess and hunting abilities are vastly superior. Capable of leaping extraordinary distances and climbing sheer cliff faces, they are fearsome predators that can take down prey much larger than themselves.

Dire snow leopards are embedded in the local folklore of the regions they inhabit. They are revered as symbols of strength and resilience, often depicted as guardians of the mountains. Their elusive nature and striking appearance have contributed to numerous legends and tales, wherein a sighting of a dire snow leopard is considered a sign of good fortune or a harbinger of significant change.

### Frost Saber Leopards 
Frost saber leopards, like their non-magical kin, are solitary creatures, stalking the icy wilderness with a graceful yet deadly intent. Their hunting prowess is unrivaled due to their unique icy magic. Frost saber leopards possess a supernatural cunning and an innate desire to destroy evil. In the wild, they hunt hunt wicked monsters for sport, and even deadly monsters such as trolls and manticores arenâ€™t safe from their predations. 

When a frost saber leopard strikes, its claws sap the strength and vitality of its prey, rendering them weak and more susceptible to the effects of their deadly bite. The fangs of these magical beasts are infused with a potent frost magic that freezes the blood of their victims, causing debilitating slowness and preventing wounds from healing. This combination of abilities makes the Frost Saber Leopard a terrifyingly efficient predator.

Frost saber leopards are steeped in the myths and legends of the regions they inhabit. They are often depicted as the chosen guardians of ancient ice deities, their very presence considered an omen of significant events or changes. The chilling beauty of their icy fangs and claws has inspired countless tales, while their unique hunting abilities have made them subjects of awe and fear. The priests and druids of some cultures are even able to summon frost saber leopards so they may serve as gaurdians in times of need. These noble beasts fight alongside their humanoid allies in service of the greater cause they pursue together.

### Snow Leopard Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Guardians of the Sacred Grove:** Local legends tell of a sacred grove, protected by a group of snow leopards. Recently, these leopards have started attacking nearby villages. The adventurers are asked to find out why the leopards are acting out of character, leading to a plot involving a polluted water source affecting the grove.|
|  2  |**The Snow Leopard Totem:** An enchanted totem that controls snow leopards has fallen into the wrong hands. Bandits are using it to terrorize the locals and protect their hideout. The party must infiltrate the hideout, neutralize the totem, and free the leopards from the bandits' control.  |
|  3 | **The Snow Leopard's Prey:** A dire snow leopard has developed a taste for livestock, and the locals are growing desperate. The party is hired to track and drive the beast back into the wilderness. However, they soon discover that the leopard's increased aggression might be linked to an even greater danger.|
|  4  |**The Legend of the Leopard:** An ancient prophecy tells of a dire snow leopard appearing when a great disaster is about to befall. With recent sightings of such a beast, the local inhabitants are in a state of panic. The adventurers must investigate, uncovering the looming disaster and finding a way to prevent it. |
|  5  |**The Cursed Claws:** A frost saber leopard has been corrupted by a dark curse and its icy magic has grown out of control, threatening nearby villages. The players must find a way to lift the curse and save the leopard and the villages from a deadly, ever-expanding winter. |
|  6  | **The Frost Saber Mystery:** A frost saber leopard has been spotted for the first time in centuries, far from its natural habitat, causing panic and fear among the locals. The adventurers must unravel why the magical creature has descended from its glacial realms, discovering a plot involving a rogue wizard attempting to control the powerful creature. |

### Snow Leopard Tactics
Snow leopards are skilled ambush predators that, while capable of inflicting high damage, have comparatively low health. These creatures carefully choose their battles, engaging only when they can launch an ambush or when a target is isolated, preferably both. They steer clear of combat in other situations.

When a snow leopard does enter combat, it won't hesitate to retreat if the circumstances turn unfavorable. Indications for this could be when its health drops below half or when its initial ambush fails to knock the target prone or secure it in a grapple.

##### Frost Saber Leopards
Frost sabers use more of the same tactics. Their decision to either flee or continue fighting is influenced by the effectiveness of their biteâ€™s chilling effect. If a target succumbs to its icy bite, the frost saber will be more likely to stay engaged in the battle to finish off the debilitated target.

### Snow Leopard Loot
The valuable items looted from snow leopards will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Snow Leopard Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
