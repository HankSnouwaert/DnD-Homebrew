## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Mountains
Like the creatures of the world, druids often adapt to a specific environment they consider to be their home.  Druids of this circle prefer to make their homes in mountain ranges, and they often carry very isolationist attitudes.  Some prefer to roam the lower slopes and valleys while others make their homes among sheer cliffs and on the tallest of peaks.  Regardless of their preferences, these druids act with the stubborn implacability of the mountains they protect. 



#### Mountain Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
Your mystical connection to mountains infuses you with the ability to cast some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Mountains Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 


##### Circle of Mountains Spells
| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Jump, Thunderous Smite |
|  3rd          | Spider Climb, Earthbind |
|  5th          | Leap Slam, Meld Into Stone      | 
|  7th          | Stone Shape, Stoneskin     |
|  9th          | Transmute Rock, Wall of Stone    |

#### Mountain Forms
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
You acquire the capacity to utilize Wild Shape as a bonus action. When utilizing Wild Shape this way, you transform into a specialized form you learned through this subclass rather than a conventional animal.

At the outset, you are familiar with three unique forms: Big Horn, Llama, and Mountain Cat. Detailed descriptions of these forms can be found in the "Wild Shapes" section of this class's description.

When shapeshifting into these forms, you can choose to either be Small or Medium. Starting at 10th level, you can also choose to be Large.

Additional wild shape forms from this subclass become available at levels 4 and 8.

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Mountains Spells list.

| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option*      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Big Horn, Llama, Mountain Cat |
|  4th          | Ape, Mountain Goat, Bear | 
|  8th          | Yak, Condor|

#### Alpine Dweller
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
You gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed and resistance to fall damage. You also gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) checks relating to mountains and the life that inhabits them.  

Additionally, you can speak with animals who dwell in mountains as though under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made while interacting with them.

#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of Mountains feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.


#### Crag Caller
*6th Level Circle of Mountains feature* <br>
As an action, you can summon a rock formation at a location on the ground within 100 feet of your vision. This formation manifests with a diameter of 30 feet at its base, extending upwards to a peak height of 30 feet. The location chosen for its appearance must be sufficiently spacious on all sides to support the formation's entire base and cannot be an area currently occupied by a Gargantuan creature or object.

If any overhead obstruction, like a ceiling, prevents the rock formation from reaching its maximum height, it halts upon contact with such resistance. The formation cannot restrain or pin creatures against other surfaces.

The summoned rock formation is considered difficult terrain for all creatures lacking a climb speed. It possesses an Armor Class of 16 and hit points equal to five times your druid level. When its hit points are reduced to zero, the rock formation crumbles into dust.

If a creature is knocked prone atop the formation, you have the option to make it tumble down to the base, thereby inflicting fall damage equivalent to the distance traversed.

Once you summon the rock formation, you cannot summon one again until you complete a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher.

#### Avatar of the Mountains
*10th Level Circle of Mountains feature* <br>
When you use your Wild Shape feature to transform into one of the forms granted by this subclass, you can choose one of the following enhancements while in that form:

**Abominable Form.** Your form turns snow-white and is covered in hardened ice, granting you resistance to cold damage. Additionally, once per turn while in this form, if you move at least 20 feet straight toward a creature before striking it with an attack, the target takes an additional 2d8 cold damage. You may push the target up to 10 feet away from you.

**Stone Form.** Your form becomes enveloped in resilient mountain rock, enhancing your Armor Class by +2. Additionally, you gain immunity to the dazed, stunned, and petrified conditions, and any critical hit scored against you is treated as a normal hit instead.

**Storm Form.** Your form crackles with the intense electricity of an alpine storm, granting you resistance to lightning damage. Additionally, as part of the action you use to Wild Shape, you may cast the *call lightning* spell without expending a spell slot. This spell does not require concentration when cast this way and will end prematurely if your Wild Shape ends. When casting the spell this way, you may select any number of visible creatures to be unharmed by the spell.


#### One With The Peaks
*14th Level Circle of Mountains feature* <br>

You and creatures of your choice can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone created or affected by your druid spells and abilities without spending extra movement.  
 
Additionally, you and creatures can burrow through this earth and stone without disturbing the material. Creatures can't end their movement inside this material, and anyone who does is ejected to the nearest unoccupied space and stunned until the end of their next turn.
