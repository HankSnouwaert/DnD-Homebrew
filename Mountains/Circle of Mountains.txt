## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Mountains
Like the creatures of the world, druids often adapt to a specific environment they consider to be their home.  Druids of this circle prefer to make their homes in mountain ranges, and they often carry very isolationist attitudes.  Some prefer to roam the lower slopes and valleys while others make their homes among sheer cliffs and on the tallest of peaks.  Regardless of their preferences, these druids act with the stubborn implacability of the mountains they protect. 



#### Mountain Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
Your mystical connection to mountains infuses you with the ability to cast some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Mountains Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 


##### Circle of Mountains Spells
| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Jump, Thunderous Smite |
|  3rd          | Spider Climb, Earthbind |
|  5th          | Leap Slam, Meld Into Stone      | 
|  7th          | Stone Shape, Stoneskin     |
|  9th          | Transmute Rock, Wall of Stone    |

#### Mountain Forms
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
You acquire the capacity to utilize Wild Shape as a bonus action. When utilizing Wild Shape this way, you transform into a specialized form you learned through this subclass rather than a conventional animal.

At the outset, you are familiar with three unique forms: Big Horn, Llama, and Mountain Cat. Detailed descriptions of these forms can be found in the "Wild Shapes" section of this class's description.

Additional wild shape forms from this subclass become available at levels 4 and 8.

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Mountains Spells list.

| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option*      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Big Horn, Llama, Mountain Cat |
|  4th          | Ape, Mountain Goat, Bear | 
|  8th          | Yak, Condor|

#### Alpine Dweller
*2nd Level Circle of Mountains Feature* <br>
You gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed and resistance to fall damage. You also gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) checks relating to mountains and the life that inhabits them.  

Additionally, you can speak with animals who dwell in mountains as though under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made while interacting with them.

#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.




#### Crag Caller
*6th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
As an action, you can summon a rock formation at a location on the ground within 100 feet of your vision. This formation manifests with a diameter of 30 feet at its base, extending upwards to a peak height of 30 feet. The location chosen for its appearance must be sufficiently spacious on all sides to support the formation's entire base and cannot be an area currently occupied by a Gargantuan creature or object.

If any overhead obstruction, like a ceiling, prevents the rock formation from reaching its maximum height, it halts upon contact with such resistance. The formation cannot restrain or pin creatures against other surfaces.

The summoned rock formation is considered difficult terrain for all creatures lacking a climb speed. It possesses an Armor Class of 16 and hit points equal to five times your druid level. When its hit points are reduced to zero, the rock formation crumbles into dust.

If a creature is knocked prone atop the formation, you have the option to make it tumble down to the base, thereby inflicting fall damage equivalent to the distance traversed.

Once you summon the rock formation, you cannot summon one again until you complete a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher.

#### Avatar of the Mountains
At 10th level, you can use your wild shape to transform into one of your forms you gained form this subclass, you can choose to gain one fallowing benifts while in the form.

* "Heart of Stone" Your from becomes covered in hard mountain rock, you gets +2 to your AC, you can't be dazed, stunned, or petrified and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead.

* "Living Avalanche" Your from covered snow white fur and hard ice, You have resistance to cold. additional once per turn If you move at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature before hitting it with a attack, the target takes an extra 2d8 cold damage and you may push it 10 feet away from you.

\pagebreak


#### Stance of Mountains
 Starting at 14th level, you and creatures of your choice can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone that was created or effected by your druid spells and abilities, without spending extra movement.  
 
 Additionally, you and creatures of your choice can move through this earth or stone as if it were air and without destabilizing it.  Creatures can't end their movement inside this material, and anyone who does is ejected to the nearest unoccupied space, and stunned until the end of their next turn.
