# Mountain Navigation
When traveling over great distances, rivers can be a boon for adventurers.  They provide a consistent land feature that prevents travelers from becoming lost, are usually a source of plentiful food and drinkable water,  and can be traveled by boat to reach distant locations quickly.  However, they also present natural hazards and often attract dangerous predators.

## Travel Activities
When the players travel long distances overland, mountains can be a significant challenge in their journey.  You may choose to modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players travel through mountains

### Travel Pace
If the players are traveling through mountains without the aid of a relatively smooth trail, it is considered rough terrain unless they have a climb speed. This is the case even if the players are traveling down the mountain slope. If the players are having to scale difficult cliff faces, you may even treat the travel as though they are climbing through difficult terrain, which would reduce their travel speed to ¼ the usual pace.

### Navigation
Mountains can be difficult to navigate, and the DMG suggests a navigation DC of around 15 for most mountain ranges. If the players are able to climb a peak with an advantageous view of the landscape, you can give them advantage on their check. Players is low valleys or ravines will likely have disadvantage on navigation attempts if they have no landmarks to gauge their progress against.

### Foraging
Mountains tend to have little to no natural resources at higher altitudes. In the alpine zone, the foraging DC should be 20 or higher. At lower altitudes with vegetation, it usually easier to find food and water.

### Belaying
There may situations where the players are scaling a cliff together using ropes and climbing equipment. They may opt to use the practice of belaying up the cliff as a safety precaution. This involves one player climbing up a short distance and securing a rope into the cliff face with a piton. 

If a player who is belaying falls while climbing, the rope their partner are attached can catch their fall. If you wish to introduce the possibility of a belay not being secured properly and thus being yanked out by the force of the fall, you can have the player who secured the belay make a Dexterity (Survival) check to see how well the rope was secured. Set the DC to be 5 less than the DC required to climb the cliff. On a success, the rope holds and the falling player is saved. On a failure the rope wasn’t secured properly and the player continues to plummet.

## Mountain Hazards
Mountains are among the most hazardous natural environments. Extreme cold, strong wind, heavy precipitation, high altitude, and slippery ice are all common mountain hazards and described in the DMG (pg. 110). Other hazards include falling debris, unpredictable weather, and ledges or ravines hidden by snow. 

### Avalanches & Rockslides
When one of these events occurs, all creatures near its path must roll intiative. The debris travels its move speed twice each round, on intiative counts 10 and 0, and continues moving this way for as long as it’s able. When the debris moves, any creature in its space moves along with it and falls prone before making a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes an amount of bludgeoning damage determined by the severity of the faling debris, and on a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

When the debris stops, it settles and buries any creatures in its space. A creature buried this way is blinded restrained and has total cover. The creature gains 1 level of exhaustion for every 5 minutes it spends buried. It can try to dig itself free as an action my making a Strength check against the DC of the event. It has advantage on this check if it has a burrow speed. On a success, the creature breaks up through the surface, ending the blinded an restrained condition on itself. A creature that fails this check three times can’t attempt to dig itself out again. 

A creature that is not buried in the debris can spend 1 minute freeing a buried creature if it know approximately where it is in the debris.

#### Avalanches
Speed equals a number of d4s equal to the size catagory times 100ft. Damage is always 1d10 bludgeoning damage.

#### Rock Slides
Damage is equal to a number of d10s equal to the size catagory. Speed is always 3d4 times 50ft.

##### Avlanche & Rock Slide Sizes and DC
|      Size Catagory       | Hazard DC |  Size: <br> Length |  Size: <br> Width | Size: Depth | 
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:| 
|           1         |         10      |         1d12x10ft.          |         1d4x10ft.          | Small
|           2         |         15         |          (1d6+4)x30ft.          |         2d6x10ft.          | Medium
|           3         |         20         |           (1d8+2)x300ft.    |        1d10x100ft.          | Large
|           4         |         25          |        1d4/2 Miles          |         1d4x1,000ft.          | Huge
|           5         |         30         |        1d4x2 Miles         |         1d4/2 Miles          | Gargantuan


\columnbreak

##### Isolated Debris

In the event there there is a few rocks or boulders falling rather than an entire rock slide, have characters in its path make a Dexterity save against the Hazard DC. On a failed save, they take 2d10 bludgeoning damage per Size Category, are pushed 5 feet per Size Category, and are knocked prone. On a successful save, the dodge the rocks, take no damage, and are not pushed or knocked prone. Pass or fail, the rocks pass by or shatter and the creatures are not moved any further.

### Falls
Mountains are filled with cliffs and suddan drops. Most will be easily visable to players and won’t need to be mentioned as they travel. However, if the players are unable to see falls for any reason, or there is combat or some other dangerous event that risks pushing players off a drop, it may become nessesary to determine the height of these falls. 
It may be convenient to brake these falls up into general sizes.

**Small Falls:** These are the most numerous drops, ranging in the 10s of feet, and many mountain encounters will feature at least one or two of these drops. You can make their height 1d10x10ft.

**Medium Falls:** These much more severe drops, reaching hundreds of feet. They will be more notable hazards during the players’ journey. You can make their height 1d4x100ft.

**Large Falls:** These the larges of drops, reaching thousands of feet. Many mountains won’t have any drops this extreme, and they make for dramatic highlights in the environment. You can make their height 1d8x500ft.

You can add falls throughout the players mountain journey when you feel it’s appropriate and use the sizes that best fit the type of mountain environment they’re traveling through. 

#### Hidden Falls
Snow an ice can conceal suddan drops in a similar way to pit traps. Cornices are structures made of snow that hang over cliff edges, hiding where solid lands ends. Creatures that step of them risk falling through and over the cliff edge. Other times, snow and thin ice will cover deep crevasses, hiding them from view until a creature falls through.
##### Spotting Falls
Rather than using passive Perception to spot hidden falls, you may opt to use the passive Survival of any characters keeping a look out. The DC to spot the fall can be anywhere from 10 (barely hidden falls) to 30 (supernaturally hidden falls). You can pick what’s appropriate for you environment or roll to determine one randomly.
##### Falling Through
If a creature doesn’t spot the fall, and falls through, it can make a Dexterity save to try to catch a ledge and prevent the fall. The DC of this save depends on the nature of the fall. A relatively narrow crag may only have a DC 10. A large cornice stretching out from a ledge covered in cursed ice may have a DC 30. This save DC can be independent from the DC to spot the fall, and you can pick one you feel is appropriate to the situation or roll to determine it randomly.

If a creature fails to grab a ledge, it falls the full length of the cliff or crevase.

### Weather
Moutain weather is more unpredictable, changeable, and extreme than in the lowlands. This is particularly true in the higher alpine zones.

## Example Random Encounter Tables
The following are different river environments across varying levels of gameplay, complete with random encounter tables you can use when the players are traversing them.  You can plug these right into your games, modify them to better suit your campaign, or simply use them as inspiration for creating and running your own river encounters.

Each river has a DC determining its foraging difficulty and an activity level suggesting how often to roll for a random encounter.  Creature names with asterisks have new stat blocks listed at the end of the document.

### Loblolly River (Level 1-4)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 4 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 10 <br>
This river meanders through the wooded hills of a small kingdom, lazily passing villages as it goes.  Though it is often used as a means of transport between towns, travelers must be wary of the dangers the unassuming river poses.  Bandits will set traps for merchant boats, and aggressive river animals will spontaneously attack travelers.  Though bandits and dangerous wildlife pose the most direct threat, the locals are most suspicious of the river fairies known for playing pranks on any who cross their path. 



##### Loblolly River Encounters

### Akhmuten River (Level 5-10)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 4 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 15 <br>
This calm river runs through an otherwise arid wasteland, providing the most significant water source in the region.  Civilization flocks to it, as do all manner of ferocious beasts.  Kingdoms have risen and fallen along the river’s banks, and many of the crumbling temples looming over its waters are no longer inhabited by their original creators.  

The humans living here have an uneasy relationship with the crocodile worshipping lizardfolk who dwell along the untamed stretches of river and in the ruins of temples lost to previous generations.  Though both groups avoid outright aggression between settlements, the lizardfolk have no qualms about preying upon stray travelers who don’t have anything of value to offer for trade.

### Crag Tooth River (Level 11-16)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 3 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 20 <br>
This river runs through a treacherous mountain valley, with other streams constantly feeding into it.  As the river charts its course through the crags, it forms deadly rapids and massive waterfalls.  These mountains are home to dangerous beasts and once housed a military outpost built atop its highest peak, near the mountain spring, which serves as the river’s source.  The abundance of food and ideally placed keep eventually caught the eye of Shirrys, a red dragon who declared war on the keep’s defenders.  After a long bitter battle, the keep was lost and became her lair. 

Now, Shirrys and her children rule the valley and hunt its inhabitants with impunity.  As a result, few people attempt to traverse it, though soldiers continue to scout the area in hopes of finding a way to retake their mountain holdings.  For those braving the journey, the river provides one of the few reliable ways of navigating the crags without becoming lost and subsequently dragon food.  Those who follow it to its source will find a mountain spring scorched bare by dragon fire and the charred remains of those who challenged the valley’s new ruler.

### River Styx (Level 17-20)
**Activity Rating:** 1 Encounter per 3 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 25 (Disadvantage unless *remove curse* spell is used while foraging)<br>
This legendary river crosses the lower planes of the multiverse, linking together multiple underworlds and serving as a common mode of transportation for fiends.  Those who drink from its waters are said to lose all memory of their past lives, and lost souls, as well as other underworld creatures, can often be found crossing its waters. 

A creature that drinks from the Styx or enters its waters is targeted by a *feeblemind* spell (save DC 20).  A creature must repeat the saving throw whenever it starts its turn in the river until it fails the save.  A feebleminded creature can drink from the Styx and swim in its waters without suffering any additional effects.
If a creature fails its saving throw and remains under the spell's effect for 30 consecutive days, the effect becomes permanent (no save) and the creature loses all its memories, becoming a near-mindless shell of its former self.  At that point, nothing short of a *wish* spell or divine intervention can undo the effect.
