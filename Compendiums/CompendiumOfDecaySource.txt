# Compendium of Decay

These beautiful and treacherous environments are a staple in many fantasy adventures. Mountains can serve as imposing impediments to travel as players try to pass them to reach their destination, or they can be the location of the player's goal, serving as a dangerous and dramatic setting for an adventure. Even in the heart of relatively tame and civilized lands, mountains serve as bastions of untamed and unforgiving wilderness, for there are few environments that pose as many hazards to travelers.

This document provides content to help you run games that feature mountains of any shape and size in any environment. This content ranges from character options for players who want their characters to be associated with mountains, to mechanics for running sessions with travel through mountains, to a bestiary of mountain creatures to populate the peaks in your games. Whether the players are only spending a day traveling through mountains or your entire campaign features mountains, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

# Running Demons of Decay Adventures 

These demons represent the existential terror that comes from knowing all things will eventually succumb to entropy and rot away. They are drawn to people and places where that decay is most apparent and revel in the tendency of mortals to neglect themselves and the world they live in, thus allowing disease and entropy to run their course unopposed. Mortals who wish to overcome the hardships of disease and decay may make pacts with these demons, forfeiting their souls for greater physical and mental resilience. 

Players are most likely to encounter these demons when they’ve been summoned by such mortals. But demons of decay may also spawn in locations that have allowed neglect and entropy to run rampant. A moldering town, a neglected sewer, or a disease-ridden city are all places where demons of decay may manifest themselves and begin spreading their plagues.



### Demon of Decay Motivations

In contrast to their grizzly appearance and nihilistic associations, demons of decay have cheery dispositions. They see the inevitable deterioration of all things as something to be celebrated, and they seek to hasten this process wherever they go. Death and decay are natural parts of the cycle of life and rebirth, and they promote this cycle by rotting away mortals and using their corpses to birth foul demons.  

It is equally important to demons of decay that they spread life wherever they go. This life just happens to be in the form of virulent diseases and parasites. To demons of decay, it is an honor to carry such life, and they are eager to impart their “gifts” to as many mortals as possible.

When role-playing demons of decay, you can have them behave in a jovial and benevolent manner. When they spread diseases, they believe they are altruistically promoting life and passing blessings onto the infected. When they inflict rot and decay on objects and creatures, they see themselves as bringing beauty into the world. There is a playfulness to their work, and demons of decay are always ready to celebrate rot and ruin being brought into the world.


#### Common Demon of Decay Motivations
* Bring about ruin through decay
* Spread different types of diseases
* Celebrate with other demons of decay
* Collect components used to brew new plagues
* Eliminate any who specialize in healing or curing diseases
* Persuade mortals to worship demon lords of decay


\columnbreak

### Demon of Decay Tactics
These fiends share many similar characteristics that lead to certain fighting styles. 

***Resilience.*** Demons of decay usually have low AC but high amounts of health. They also often have regenerative abilities that they can pass on to each other. These traits lead to them being accustomed to taking a lot of hits. 

***Melee Oritanted.*** Demons of decay usually have better melee options than ranged options. There are exceptions to this, but it is usually in their best interest close in on foes from all sides and keep players locked up in melee combat.

***Limited Mobility Options.*** Demons of decay have access to multiple steeds, but as far as mounts go, none of them are particularly fast. Demons of decay usually want to find ways to bog players down so they can avoid being out-maneuvered, especially since they do best when they can close into melee range.

***Debuffs & Damage Over Time Effects.*** Demons of decay usually don’t do outrageous amounts of damage all at once. Instead, they prefer to infect players with effects that whittle them down over time. They also leave hazardous terrain across the battlefield, which does damage over time and helps tip maneuverability options in their favor.



#### Engagement

Because of their poor stealth, most demons of decay won’t be able to surprise the players. And their reliance on melee attacks means the fight will often start with them shambling toward the players as quickly as possible and bogging them down in close combat. Demons of decay usually perform better when grouped up, so they will try to converge on their targets into a massed group, coming from multiple angles when possible.


#### Combat

Demons of decay show little concern for their well-being and will risk taking heavy damage if it means they can subject the players to their attacks and abilities. Because they often use abilities that deal damage over time, demons of decay try to “spread the love” to as many players as possible to maximize these abilities. Players that can cure or mitigate the putrid abilities of these demons quickly earn their ire and become the highest priority targets.

#### Retreat
Demons of decay never retreat out of fear for their existence, even when on their home plane where death would be permanent. They see their end as simply part of the natural way of things. They usually only flee a battle to get reinforcements, find more appealing victims, or lure pursuers into a more exposed position for a counterattack.

# Player Options

## Primal Path

### Path of the Demon Soul
Barbarians who follow this accursed path discover a demonic presence within themselves, yearning for release. This presence may be the result of a demonic curse, overexposure to Abyssal magics, or even demonic possession. In any case, when these barbarians lose control, their fiendish nature manifests itself visibly, warping their appearance and allowing them to unleash an unholy fury upon their foes.


#### Demonic Surges
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
The dark powers coursing through you give you access to demonic abilities in the form of Demonic Surges. Demonic Surges are supernatural abilities that momentarily boost your combat abilities or create fiendish spell-like effects. You use your Strength modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Demonic Surge and when making an attack roll with one. If you are raging, you may add your rage damage to any one damage roll made as a result of a Demonic Surge. Using a Demonic Surge also counts as making an attack that round for the purposes of maintaining your rage.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

<div align="center"> 

**Surge save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

**Surge attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

</div>

**Surge Slots.** The Demonic Surges table shows how many surge slots you have to use Demonic Surges of 1st level and higher. To use one of these surges, you must expend a slot of the surge's level or higher. You regain all expended Surge Slots when you complete a long rest.

**Surges Known of 1st-Level and Higher.** You know three 1st-level Demonic Surges of your choice from the list Demonic Surges section, which starts on the next page.

The Surges Known column of the Demon Soul Surges table shows when you learn more Demonic Surges of 1st level or higher.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the surges you know with another surge of your choice. This surge must be of a level for which you have surge slots.

#### Fiendish Resilience 
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
Your demonic nature grants you increased resistance to elemental forces. You now have resistance to lightning, fire, and cold damage while raging.

#### Reckless Surge
*6th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>

You may apply your Reckless Attack feature to any attacks you make as part of your Demonic Surges. Additionally, when you use a Demonic Surge that requires creatures to make a saving throw, you may choose to force all affected creatures to make their saving throw with disadvantage. If you do, all attack rolls against you have advantage and all saving throws you make have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.


#### Brutal Surge
*10th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
You may apply your Brutal Critical feature to any attacks you make with your Demonic Surges. Additionally, when you use your Reckless Surge or Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to have your Demonic Surges ignore all resistances and treat all immunity as though it is resistance until the start of your next turn. Doing so causes you to lose all resistances granted by your rage until the start of your next turn.


#### Chaos Conduit
*14th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
While raging, you may use a 1st level demonic surge without expending a Surge Slot. You can use this ability only once per rage.

#### Demonic Surges
The surges are grouped by surge level and listed alphabetically. 

##### 1st Level Surges
&emsp;**Abyssal Skulk.**  As an action, you magically turn invisible. The invisibility lasts for 1 minute or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force a creature to make a saving throw.

**Arrogant Rage.** When you enter a rage or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage such that you gain a surge of reckless confidence, allowing you to demoralize any who would dare strike you. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



While raging this way, whenever a creature makes an attack against you and would have advantage as a result of your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge features, you can use your reaction to demoralize that creature, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it loses the advantage your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge granted it and instead suffers disadvantage on the attack.
 
Creatures immune to being charmed and frightened automatically pass this save.

This surge ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.



**Burning Whip.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to summon a burning whip in a free hand that you can use to immediately make a single melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 3d6 fire damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward you. 

The whip disappears immediately after you make this attack.

**Defile Earth.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to cause the ground within 10 feet of you to become polluted with demonic ichor. The area is corrupted for the next minute, during which time it is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. 

As an action, you can cause any number of 5-foot-by-5-foot square areas covered in this ichor to burst with demonic rot, which clears that area of the ichor. Any creature standing in the burst must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

<div style='margin-top:325px;'></div>

\pagebreakNum

**Demonic Appendages.** As a bonus action, choose a damage type from piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. You cause your hands to mutate into demonic appendages (such as claws, tentacles, or skewers) for the next hour or until you dismiss this surge as a bonus action. The appendages can be used as weapons while not holding anything and count as simple melee weapons with the Light property that add your Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls when you attack with them. They each deal 1d10 of the chosen damage type on it.

**Fiendish Horns.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to grow large demonic horns and use them to make a single melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 3d8 piercing damage, and if the target is a creature and you moved at least 20 ft. before making the attack, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone, and you may push it up to 10 feet away from you.

The horns disappear immediately after making this attack.


**Flames of Chaos.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to hurl a bolt of iridescent fire at a creature within 100 feet of you as a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 fire damage and becomes engulfed in chaotic flames until the end of your next turn. 

If the creature takes damage from one of your Demonic Surges while covered in these flames,  the flames disappear, and that surge deals an additional 1d12 damage as it draws energy from the fires.

**Foul Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 2d6 poison damage. The target must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

**Fresh Meat.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to feast on the corpse of one Small or larger creature within 5 feet of you that died within the last minute, causing you to regain a number of hit points equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier.

**Hateful Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by focusing it into a hatred for another creature you can see within 90 feet of you. For the duration of this effect, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to that creature whenever you hit it with an attack. 

This surge ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

\columnbreak

**Hungering Jaws.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to attempt to bite a creature within 5 feet of you with razor-sharp jaws as a melee spell attack. On a hit, you deal 2d8 piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, you regain a number of hit points equal to the damage it dealt.

**Hypnotic Summons.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to whisper maddening words to one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you, twisting its mind and drawing it toward you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as close as its speed allows toward you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move toward you. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

**Lightning Blade.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to create a blade of chaotic lighting in a free hand that you can use to immediately make a single melee spell attack. This attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 18 or higher. On a hit, it deals 2d12 lightning damage. The blade disappears immediately after making this attack.

**Nightmare Rage.** When you enter a rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can enhance your rage by filling your mind with nightmarish visions that you can inflict upon others. While raging this way, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack or an attack from one of your Demonic Surges, you may surround the target with nightmarish visions for the next minute or until you surround another creature with visions. 

If the target willingly moves 5 feet before the visions end, it must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success, and the visions affecting it end.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge beyond what this ability allows you to maintain.

\pagebreakNum

**Savage Rush.**  As a bonus action, you draw upon an unholy vigor, allowing you to move up to your movement speed horizontally in a straight line. The first creature you run into during this movement must succeed on a Strength saving or be pushed ahead of you for the rest of the movement. If the creature succeeds on the save, or you run into a second creature, your movement stops.

##### 2nd Level Surges

**Burning Smite.**  When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 3d10 fire damage.

**Cruel Revival.** As a bonus action, you speak a dark incantation which awakens the corpse of a Small or Medium creature you can see within 30 feet of you that died within the last 10 minutes. The corpse immediately stands up and becomes a **zombie** (the statistics for zombies can be found in the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your Strength ability modifier. In combat, the zombie shares your initiative count.

While the zombie is within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to mentally command it to do your bidding. If it receives no such commands, it takes no actions and does not move. 

The zombie crumbles to dust after 10 minutes.

**Demonic Eyes.** As an action, you cause your eyes to take on demonic traits and appearance. For the next 8 hours, you gain darkvision out to 120 and areas of dim light are not considered lightly obscured to you.

**Horror Nimbus.** As an action, you magically emit scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of that you that can see the light must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.


**Indestructible Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a <br> bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage to <br> make yourself nearly indestructible. While this effect <br> lasts, you have an advantage on Constitution checks <br> and saving throws and resistance to all damage <br> except radiant damage.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute <br> passes, or you enhance your rage with another <br> Demonic Surge.

**Inflicted Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a <br> bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage <br> by attempting to psychically inflict another creature <br> within 120 feet of you with it. That creature must <br> succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be <br> subjected to this rage for one minute, until your <br> rage ends, or until you enhance your rage with <br> another surge.

\columnbreak

While under the effects of this rage, the creature can only use its action to make weapon attacks or take the Dash action, and it can no longer cast or maintain concentration on spells.

The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Inhuman Grace.**  As a bonus action, you endow yourself with such unnatural grace that any you stride past have their minds rent by the sight of your movements. Until the end of your turn, whenever you move 5 feet away from a creature that can see you, it takes 2d8 psychic damage. A creature can only take this damage once per turn. 

If you used your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge features this turn, your speed also increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn.


**Insanity Gaze.**  As an action, you turn your madding gaze upon a creature you can see within 90 feet of you, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must use its movement on its next turn to move within 5 feet of a creature of your choice and then use its action to make a melee attack against that creature. If it is unable to reach the chosen creature, it does not use its action that turn.

**Malevolent Flame.** As an action, you create an area of flame that fills a 5-foot cube in front of you and move it out 30 ft. away from you, where it remains until the end of your next turn, at which point the flame moves toward your current location. The flame disappears after reaching you or moving 30 ft. toward you.

Whenever the flame moves into the space of a creature other than you, or a creature other than you ends its turn standing in the flame, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage, and on a pass, it takes half as much.

The flame ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

**Torturous Claws.** As an action, two razor-sharp clawed limbs grow from you and strike at nearby foes. Make two melee spells attacks against targets within 5 feet of you. On a hit, a target takes 2d10 slashing damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn as it is racked with pain.

If both attacks made this way hit the same target, it is afflicted with even more intense pain, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. It takes an additional 3d10 psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. 

The limbs disappear immediately after you make the attacks with them.

**Unholy Stench.** As an action, you cause a foul smell to emanate out to a 10-foot radius around yourself. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of your next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.


**Spew Bile.** As an action, you spew forth a stream of corrosive bile. Each creature in a 15-foot cone in front of you takes 4d4 acid damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is covered in acid, causing it to take another 4d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn unless a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off of it beforehand. On a successful save, a creature is not covered in acid and takes no additional damage at the end of its next turn.



**Rampaging Rage.**  When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage with an insatiable bloodlust. While under this effect, up to once on each of your turns, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack or a Demonic Surge, you gain an additional action. This action can only be used to take a Dash action or an Attack action to make one weapon attack.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

##### 3rd Level Surges

**Cackling Flail.** As an action, you choose a point you can see within 15 feet of you and conjure a three-headed demonic flail made of cackling skulls in a free hand which you use to make three melee spell attacks against up to three different creatures who are within 15 feet of the chosen point. On a hit, an attack from this flail deals 3d8 thunder damage. 

If one or more of the creatures hit by the flail is reduced to 0 hit points, you may immediately make another attack with it against each of the remaining targets who still have 1 or more hit points. If this second set of attacks reduces another creature to 0 hit points, you may repeat the process.

Once you can no longer make any attacks, the flail disappears.

**Contaminating Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage to channel it into a stream of demonic corruption that oozes into a 15-foot radius area centered on yourself. This area moves with you, and you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. 

When a creature you haven’t designated enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage, and its speed is halved while it remains in the area. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and its speed isn’t reduced.

The contaminated area disappears if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Dark Flight.** As an action, you cause wings to spring from your back granting you flying speed of 60 feet for the next 10 minutes. If the effect ends while you are in the air, you immediately begin falling unless some other effect prevents this. 


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/wghpMLm/Burning-Rune-Demon-Kaldheim-Mt-G-Art-1024x768.jpg' style='position:absolute;left:-0px;top:-100px;width:820px' />

\pagebreakNum

**Devour.** As an action, your jaw unhinges, and you attempt to magically swallow a Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of you that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by you. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside you, and it takes 3d4 acid damage at the start of each of your turns. 

The creature is swallowed until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell, except it can be maintained while raging). If you lose concentration, the swallowed creature is regurgitated and falls prone into a space of your choice within 5 feet of you.

**Ecstatic Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 4d8 psychic damage to it as you subject it to overwhelming bliss. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn.

**Eldritch Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by allowing maddening demonic knowledge to flood your mind. For the duration of this effect, you have advantage on all Intelligence checks and saving throws. Additionally, once per turn, you may use a 1st level Demonic Surge that replaces one of your attacks without expending a surge slot. 

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Fire Stomp.** As an action, you slam the ground, causing fire to erupt out from you to a 15-foot radius. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 fire damage. On a pass, it takes half as much damage.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Lightning Lance.** As an action, you launch a bolt of lightning in a 60-foot long 10-foot wide line. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Manic Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you channel your rage to the point of manic insanity, turning yourself into a whirlwind of death. While in this state, if you make an attack that would have advantage as a result of your Reckless Attack feature, you can forgo that advantage to make the same attack against another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within the attack’s range. These extra attacks can’t benefit from advantage from any source or be replaced with Demonic Surges. 

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Undying Evil.**  You gain the demonic ability to escape death. As an action, you place a ward on yourself that lasts for 8 hours or until you use this surge again. If you die while under the effects of the ward, your body dissolves into foul ichor, leaving behind only the equipment you were wearing or carrying. 

After 1 minute, you reform in the unoccupied space closest to the location where you died. Your soul must be both willing and able to reform, and you can’t return to life if you died of old age. 

When you reform, you return to life with 1 hit point and the ward ends.


**Warp Flesh.** As an action, you target a creature you can see within 5 feet of you and warp its body with chaotic magics. It must make a Charisma saving throw or become brittle until the end of your next turn. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

**Warp Jump.** As an action, you teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 100 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Before or after teleporting, you can make one attack as part of this action.


##### 4th Level Surges

**Bellow of Endless Fury.** As an action, you unleash a roar of fiery rage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Chaotic Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 4d10 force damage as you channel raw chaos through it. 

Additionally, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or suffer one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below until the end of your next turn.


##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight. At the end of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|

**Limb Storm** As an action, you briefly grow extra sets of demonic limbs which strike out at nearby creatures. You may make up to six melee spell attacks with these limbs as part of this action, which each deal 1d12 piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage (your choice) on hit. 

The limbs disappear immediately after you make the attacks with them.

**Oozing Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage, causing you to grow wobbling mounds of slime and flesh, which seal your wounds as you receive them. For the duration of this effect, you gain a +10 to the Constitution saving throw you make as part of your Relentless Rage feature, and you regain 1d6 hit points at the start of each of your turns.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Shared Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you can enhance your rage to inspire it in another willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature gains the following benefits until your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge:

* It has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

* When it makes its first attack on each of its turns, it can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives it advantage on melee weapon attacks, but attack rolls against it have advantage until its next turn.
* If the creature is able to cast spells, it can't cast them or concentrate on them.



**Sentient Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by focusing it into an entirely separate consciousness, which may even form itself into a new head that grows from your body. When you do so, you may choose two Demonic Surges you know that both enhance your rage and have a combined level of 4 or less. You gain the effects of both those surges until your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Soul Rend.** Your chest cracks open and projects a vortex of life-draining energy out to 30 feet from you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature that is Small or larger and dropped to 0 hit points by this effect dies, causing you to regain hit points equal to the number of hit dice it had.

**Stunning Screech.** As an action, you emit a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of you that can hear it must succeed on a DC Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. 

**Summon Demon.** You utter foul abyssal words, calling a demon forth from the chaos of the Abyss. Choose a demon of CR 5 or lower such as a **shadow demon** or a **barlgura**. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 hour has passed.

The demon obeys your commands, and in combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one that is listed in its stat block or any other action that the demon would be capable of.

### Demons Soul Barbarian Archetypes
If you have a specific type of demon or demon lord you want your barbarian to emulate the powers of, you can choose Demonic Surges that thematically fit with that demon. The following Demonic Surge lists are grouped based on common demonic themes and demon lords, though you may need to change how you describe of some of the surges to better fit the powers associated with your theme. 

Note that some surges like *demonic appendages*, *demonic eyes*, *undying evil*, and *summon demon* are so general that they can thematically fit with almost any type of demon.

### Demon Soul Adventurers
Below are some options that can be used as inspiration for your barbarian’s backstory and the origin of their powers. 

| d12  | Demon Soul Origin |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | You underwent a dark ritual in exchange for the power needed to achieve your goals |
|  2  | You hail from a demon worshiping barbarian tribe.  You've abandoned the tribe and their evil ways, but you still wield the dark forces they bestowed upon you. |
|  3  | A gateway to the Abyss opened near your home town.  You survived the ordeal, but were forever changed by its demonic energies.
|  4  | You were the subject of dark and bizarre arcane experiments.  |
|  5  | All you remember were fiends attacking your town.  Now, when you're in danger, you black out.  When you come to, you're surrounded by bodies and left with only brief flashes of what happened. |
|  6  | You took it upon yourself to trap the soul of a demon within yourself, thereby preventing it from returning to the Abyss and reforming.  |
|  7  | You were subjected to a fiendish curse which you struggle to keep from consuming your soul. |
|  8  | You have fiendish parentage, which you learned about when you came of age and your fiendish traits began manifesting. |
|  9  | You've attracted the attention of a demon lord who is bestowing its "gifts" upon you in hopes of corrupting your soul.
| 10  | You were once a demon, but sought to escape the Abyss and find redemption by reincarnating yourself as a mortal.  
| 11  | You are dedicated to fighting demons by using their own powers against them, and you've turned yourself into an unrelenting slayer who brings doom to any fiend you find.

## Demon Soul Barbarian NPCs
The following stat blocks can be used to describe non-player characters who are demon soul barbarians or warriors with similar powers. You can choose the stat block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC and apply the Demonic Surges of your choice that best fit the desired theme of the NPC, as described in its Demonic Surges feature. You may also opt to provide your NPCs with fewer known surges than the stat block suggests so as to keep its combat options simpler and make it easier for players to learn its attack patterns.

To further customize your NPC, apply the racial traits of whichever humanoid race you’ve chosen for it.

> ##### Demon Barbarian Building Tips
> &#8226; Don’t add more different types of surges than you need to reach the design goal of your barbarian
> <br> &#8226; Only having one surge that enhances the barbarian’s rage makes it a lot easier to manage.
> <br> &#8226; Changing out weapons & skills or modifying mental stats are a simple ways to help differentiate the look and style of your barbarians.
<br> &#8226; If you give a barbarian the *eldritch rage* surge, it needs to know a surge that can be used in place of an attack, and it's best to allow it to use that surge as a bonus action while raging. Otherwise, it will rarely get the same resource-saving benefits as a player from the ability.

## Demon Soul Barbarian Examples
The following is a list of example stat blocks made using the demon soul barbarian templates. The barbarian examples don’t always know as many surges as their template stat block suggests. Rather than using surge slots, the different demonic surge abilities each have a certain number of uses. Other modifications include tweaking non-combat stats, swapping out weapons, or replacing the rage feature with the one enhanced by a known demonic surge. All these changes are made to enhance the theme of the barbarian and streamline its stat block for readability.

## Druid Circle

### Circle of Plagues
 Druids of the circle of plagues bond with the countless diseases and maladies brought about by nature.  While other druids may disavow the pestilent afflictions which arise from the natural world, these plague druids revere them.  They view the squeamishness of other druids as a sign of weakness and naivete, for to truly embrace nature is to accept every life form, even horrid diseases.

Plague druids excel at infecting creatures with a variety of ever-evolving diseases.  While these afflictions can quickly bring their enemies low, those lucky enough to earn the druid's favor will find themselves enhanced by their infections.  Just as diseases quickly adapt to better spread amongst their victims, these druids constantly adapt and evolve their plagues to suit their situation.  

#### Circle Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You have an innate connection to the pestilent aspects of nature, resulting in you knowing the *chill touch* cantrip.  It counts as a druid cantrip for you, but it doesn't count against your number of cantrips known.  
Your pestilent magic also grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Plagues Spells table.
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *bane*, *miasma of pestilence**,  |
|  3rd          | *blindness/deafness*, *stream of corruption**|
|  5th          | *puddle of ooze**, *stinking cloud*      | 
|  7th          | *blight*, *racid visitation**|
|  9th          | *cloudkill*, *contagion* |

**New spells listed at the end of the document*

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Produce Pathogen
*2nd Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You can summon a specialized disease strain to bolster allies and wither enemies.  As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to attempt to infect a creature within 5 feet of you, including yourself.  It must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail.  On a failure, it is infected with a disease with one symptom of your choice.  You may automatically infect yourself with the same disease when you use this feature.

Whenever a creature is infected by one of your diseases, you can choose to make it a Symbiotic Host rather than a Victim, in which case it gains positive effects from the disease.  The symptoms for Victims and Symbiotic Hosts are described in the Disease Symptoms section at the end of this document.  

At the start of each of your turns, all infected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, which they can choose to fail.  On a successful save, creatures end the disease on themselves.  

After these saves are made, every creature that's still infected spreads its disease to another uninfected creature within 5 feet of it.  This uninfected creature must make the same saving throw or become infected with the same disease.  If there are more than one uninfected creatures within 5 feet of an infected creature, you may choose which of the creatures becomes infected if you can see it.  Otherwise, DM chooses one at random.

A creature can only be infected by the disease once and can't become infected by it again until you use this ability again.  

The disease ends for all creatures after 10 minutes or if you use this feature again.

#### Unnatural Immunity
*6th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You have resistance to necrotic damage and may also choose to automatically succeed any saving throws you make against diseases.

#### Evolving Epidemic
*6th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You've learned how to mutate your diseases to better suit them to any given situation.  When you use your Produce Pathogen feature, you may alter it with one of the following traits:

***Air Born.*** An infected creature can now spread the disease to another uninfected creature within 30 feet of it.

***Plague Missile.*** When you use Produce Pathogen, you can infect a creature up to 120 feet away from you rather than 5 feet from you.

***Pestilent Hex.***  The disease can't spread beyond yourself and the initial target, but you may choose two different Symptoms for the disease, and the target creature has disadvantage on the saving throw against becoming infected.

***Super Spreader.*** An infected creature now spreads the disease to each creature within 5 feet of it rather than just one.

#### Paroxysm
*10th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
When a creature that is not a symbiotic host for a disease fails its saving throw at the end of its turn against that disease, it suffers from the disease's severe symptom effects until the disease ends.  These severe symptoms do not replace the original symptoms unless stated otherwise.


#### Plague Shape
*14th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
When you use your Produce Pathogen feature against a creature that fails its saving throw against the disease, you may transform into the very disease you are infecting it with, causing you to disappear into the infected creature.  While inside the infected creature, you use the creature's senses and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that target diseases.

Additionally, you can't concentrate on spells unless they are from your Circle of Plagues Spell List, and you can't interact with the outside world in any way other than by casting spells from your Circle of Plagues Spell List.  Spells cast this way don't require components and are treated as though you are occupying the infected creature's space.  

Creatures you are infecting in this form have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells unless they are symbiotic hosts, in which case they automatically succeed.  Symbiotic hosts you are infecting take no damage from your spells if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

If you attempt to spread your disease from the creature you're inhabiting to one or more creatures, you may impose disadvantage on the saving throw one of those creatures makes to avoid becoming infected.  If it fails its saving throw and becomes infected, you move from your current host to this new creature as part of the infection.  This does not end the disease affecting the previous creature.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This form ends if your host creature dies, the disease affecting it ends, or you use your bonus action to return to your normal form.  Additionally, the host creature can use its action to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC, ending this effect on a success, though this does not end the disease affecting it.  When the effect ends, you reappear in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.  

### Disease Symptoms
The following disease symptoms are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Delirium
&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** Attack rolls have advantage against the infected creature as long as there are three or more creatures within 5 feet of it.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** Attack rolls have disadvantage against the symbiotic host as long as there are three or more creatures within 5 feet of it.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** The infected creature suffers the effects of the *enemies abound* spell.

> ##### Describing Symptoms
> The names of the symptoms listed here are meant to provide simple and easily recognizable descriptions of what's happening to the infected creature.  However, you can come up with your own descriptions to fit the symptom's effects.  For example, the continual damage dealt by the Fever symptom could instead be described as being caused by flesh-eating bacteria, and the effects of Nausea could instead be caused by muscle spasms. 

#### Fatigue

&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** The infected creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.***  The symbiotic host's speed is increased by 10 feet.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** The infected creature's speed is halved, it can't use reactions, and on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both.

#### Fever
&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** At the start of the infected creature's turn, it takes necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your druid level (rounded up).

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** When a symbiotic host is infected by this disease, it gains temporary hit points Wisdom modifier + half your druid level (rounded up).  These temporary hit points last until the disease ends.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** At the start of the infected creature's turn, it takes necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier + twice your druid level.  This replaces the damage dealt by the initial effect.

#### Mind Fire 
&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** Whenever the infected creature makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses its Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** Whenever the symbiotic host makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses its Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier, it may roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** Whenever the infected creature casts a spell of first level or higher, it takes 1d12 psychic damage per level of the spell. 

#### Nausea
&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** Whenever the infected creature makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses its Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength modifier, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** Whenever the symbiotic host makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses its Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength modifier, it may roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** Damage dealt by an infected creature's weapon attacks is halved.


#### Weeping Eyes

&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** The infected creature is unable to see anything farther than 30 feet away from it.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** The symbiotic host gains blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. If it already has blindsight, its range increases by 10 feet.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** The infected creature is blinded.

## Spells of Decay


Spellcasters wielding magic of decay favor <br> spells that inflict rot, disease, and entropy. <br> While many existing D&D spells can <br> represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this putrescent style of sorcery into your campaigns.


#### Miasma of Pestilence
*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V S M (A bit of durian fruit)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A cloud of putrescent vapor appears in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a moderate wind (at least 5 miles per hour) disperses it after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Each creature completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.

#### Puddle of Ooze
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of slug slime)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid, Sorcerer 
___

You cover the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range with acidic ooze, causing it to become difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 1d4 acid damage for every 5 feet it travels.

When the ooze appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage.

#### Rancid Visitation
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Warlock
___

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, it takes 4d10 necrotic damage and is afflicted with a disease that lasts until the spell ends.

\columnbreak

A creature afflicted by this disease takes 4d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of your turns and must then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. 

If a diseased creature drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can end the disease on the creature and cause it to infect a new creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it. The new creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be infected with the same disease for the remainder of the spell's duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, each time it would deal damage, it deals an additional 1d10 necrotic damage for each slot level above 4th.

#### Spirit Leech
*1st-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A mosquito)
- **Duration:**  1 hour
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You reach out and drain the life force of a target creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d12 necrotic damage, or half as much on a successful one. You gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. Constructs are immune to this spell's effects.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the necrotic damage dealt to targeted creatures and creatures in the area of the cone of bile by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Magic Items of Decay
Powerful demons or cults of disease and decay will sometimes craft magical items which channel their foul powers.  They may wield these items themselves or gift them to worthy devotees.  The following magic items can be used to represent these gifts of decay in your campaign.

#### Fetid Shroud
*Wondrous item, very rare, 6,000gp (requires attunement)* <br>

The shroud feels and smells as though it's been soaked in a fever sweat. The air around it is thick and chokes any who linger too close.

While wearing this shroud, any creature which starts its turn within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the effects of this shroud for 1 hour.

#### Flail of Pestilence
*Weapon (flail), very rare, 24,000gp (requires attunement)*

Said to be crafted from the growths and encrusted puss spewed out by a demon of decay, this flail inflicts those it strikes with demonic rot. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Once during your turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you may force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 3d8 necrotic damage.  After failing three of these saving throws within one minute, it is afflicted with one of the diseases described by the *contagion* spell (your choice) for one minute.

#### Flesh Peeling Bell
*Wondrous item, very rare, 26,000gp (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

The cursed ringing of this bell accelerates decay, allowing necrotic magic to inflict wounds that quickly rot away their victim. It can be held in one hand and used as a spell casting focus.

Once per turn, while you are holding the bell, when you hit a creature with a spell attack that deals necrotic damage, or a creature fails its saving throw against a spell you cast that deals necrotic damage, you can inflict it with a wound. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. 

Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of all such wounds on it on a success.

#### Helm of the Blighter
*Wondrous item, very rare, 7,000gp (requires attunement by a druid)*

This foul helm was crafted from decaying animal bones held together by blighted moss.  While wearing this helm, any beast that a druid shapeshifts into becomes a rotting mockery of its natural form.

If you transform using your Wild Shape feature while wearing this helm, you may choose to take necrotic damage equal to 5 x the CR of the creature you are transforming into.  This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.  If this reduction reduces your hit point maximum to 0 or less, you die.  This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. 

If you choose to take this damage while transforming using Wild Shape, your animal form has the following alterations:

* Your creature type changes to undead.
* You are immune to necrotic and poison damage and the poisoned condition.
* Whenever you deal damage with an attack in this form, you can change the damage type to necrotic or poison.
* Your form's hit points are increased by the amount equal to the necrotic damage you took from the helm when you transformed.

#### Rot Blade
*Weapon (any sword or axe), uncommon, 1,000gp (requires attunement)*<br>
This rusty blade is encrusted with the entrails of plague victims, and those it cuts are quickly infected with lethal diseases.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it is infected with the blade's disease.  At the start of each of the infected creature's turns, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage and then makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success.  Once a creature becomes infected by the blade, it can't be infected again for the next 24 hours.

#### Shield of Growths
*Armor (shield), rare, 3,000gp*

The rusted frame of this shield is reinforced with living blubber and grime, which feeds off the open wounds of its wielder.

While holding this shield, whenever you take damage from an attack, the shield grants an additional +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.  It can increase its AC up to 4 times this way within a turn.

#### Staff of Decay
*Staff, very rare, 26,000gp (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*<br>
This blighted staff was carved from the rotting wood of a dying treant and holds power over the processes of death and decay.

\columnbreak

You have resistance to necrotic damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *inflict wounds* (1 charge), *stream of corruption* (2 charges), *blight* (4 charges), or *circle of death* (6 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff melts into brackish water and is destroyed.

# Disease Mechanics
Diseases, both magical and mundane, can provide environmental hazards or be the focus of entire adventures.  Diseases could be caused by viruses, bacteria, parasites, or magical maladies.  The ways creatures can contract them, their symptoms, and their cures vary wildly.  

This document provides a systemic way of defining individual diseases, similar to the way spells are described.  The following tools will allow you to custom craft diseases for your games, and the examples given at the end of the document can be used as creative inspiration or dropped right into your adventures.  

## Disease Attributes
The following attributes can be used to describe the mechanics of any given disease.

### Targets
This lists the types of creatures this disease can infect.

### Transmission 
This is the means through which a creature can potentially contract the disease.  For example, being hit with a bite attack from an infected creature or being within 10 feet of an infected creature for 1 minute.  

### Saving Throw
This is the type of save and DC of that save that a creature must make if subjected to the conditions described by Transmission.  The initial save to determine if a player character is infected should be made in secret by the DM. If the creature succeeds on the saving throw, it is not infected.  

Unless stated otherwise, the creature that succeeds can still be forced to make the saving throw again if subjected to the transmission conditions again.

### Incubation Time  
This is the time between the contraction of the disease and the manifestation of the first symptoms.

### Starting Severity
Many diseases have different stages of severity, with each stage having its own symptoms.  This describes the severity level creatures start with when they first display symptoms.

### Increasing Severity Rate
This is the time it takes the disease to potentially reach a higher level of severity.  At this point, the infected creature repeats the saving throw against the disease.  On a failure, the disease increases in severity. 

### Save DC Modifier
Some diseases become progressively easier or more difficult to cure as time goes on.  This describes the change to the save DC each time the infected creature makes a saving throw against the disease.  This change is applied before the saving throw is made.

### Reversible Severity
This true/false statement describes whether a creature can naturally shrug off the effects of the disease without outside intervention.  If it is true, then whenever a creature succeeds on its saving throw against the disease increasing in severity, the severity of the disease decreases.  If the severity level reaches 0, the creature is cured of the disease.

\pagebreakNum



### Cures
These are any outside effects that can cure a creature of the disease.  They could include anything from different types of potions and herbs to healing ceremonies performed at specific sacred sites.

### Severity Levels  
This lists the descriptions of the symptoms at each severity level.

## Curing Diseases With Magical Abilities
Abilities like *lessor restoration* and Lay on Hands can instantly cure most diseases.  If you wish to make diseases more difficult to remove, you can use or modify either of the following rules additions.

### Ability Check to Cure
Whoever uses the ability to attempt to cure the disease must succeed on an ability check against the disease's current save DC to eradicate it successfully.  If the ability being used to cure the disease is a feature granted by a class with a spellcasting feature, the healer can add their Spell Attack Modifier for that class to the ability check.  Otherwise, the healer can add their Wisdom modifier + their proficiency modifier to the ability check.

### Curing By Severity Level
When an ability that cures diseases is used on a diseased creature, it only reduces the severity level by 1.  
If you are using the Ability Check to Cure rule, you can allow the healer to reduce an additional severity level if the check's result was 5 or more over the disease's DC.  You can extend this rule to allow a result of 10 over the DC to cure 2 additional severity levels, 15 over the DC to cure 3 additional severity levels, and so on.

\columnbreak

## Example Disease Scenario
The following is an example of a disease and how it could play out in a typical game.

#### Head Chills
This is a fairly mundane sickness that is highly contagious and impairs its target's effectiveness in almost every way.  Fortunately, it is not a deadly disease, and its symptoms almost always clear on their own.  <br>
___
**Targets:** Any humanoid <br>
**Trasmission:** A target starts its turn within 5 feet of an infected and symptomatic creature<br>
**Saving Throw:** DC 13 Constitution Saving Throw <br>
**Incubation Time:** 1d3 days <br>
**Starting Severity:** 2 <br>
**Increasing Severity Rate:** Every 1 Day <br>
**Save DC Modifier:** -1 <br>
**Reversible Severity:** True <br>
**Cures:** Eating an apple grown from a treant <br>
**Severity Levels:**

* **Severity 1:** Whenever the infected creature makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

* **Severity 2:** Whenever the infected creature makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check it must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.

* **Severity 3:** Whenever the infected creature makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check it must roll a d8 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw. 


If you are running the example disease described above, a player character will need to be within five feet of an infected creature to risk contracting the disease.  Every time the character starts its turn close to the infected creature, you make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw for that character in secret.  Repeat this saving throw every time the character starts its turn within 5 feet of the infected creature until the character contracts the disease.  Do not tell the player if or when their character is infected.

If the character is infected, the symptoms described by Severity 2 will be experienced in 1 to 3 days, at which point the player will learn their character is infected.  After a day of being infected, the character makes another Constitution saving throw against the disease (which can now be made by the player.)   Because the DC modifier is -1, the save DC is now 12.  On a failed save, the Severity of the character's symptoms increase to 3, and on a successful save, they decrease to 1.

The character continues to make saving throws each day, with the save DC decreasing by 1 each time.  Failed saves move the severity up one level, and successful saves move it down one level.  This continues until the severity moves to 0, and which point the character is cured.

The disease ends early if the character consumes an apple grown from a treant or is subjected to an effect that removes diseases.

## Example Diseases
The following are examples of other types of diseases with a variety of attributes.  You can drop them right into your games as they are, modify them to better suit your adventures, or use them as inspiration for new diseases of your own.  


#### Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. <br>
___
**Targets:** Any humanoid <br>
**Trasmission:** A target takes damage from a weapon tainted with the disease<br>
**Saving Throw:** DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw <br>
**Incubation Time:** 1 hour <br>
**Starting Severity:** 1 <br>
**Increasing Severity Rate:** Every 1 Hour <br>
**Save DC Modifier:** +1 <br>
**Reversible Severity:** False <br>
**Cures:**  The Healing Touch ability of an angel <br>
**Severity Levels:**

* **Severity 1 - 10:** Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while infected, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.  This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.  
Whenever the disease's severity increases, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 + the new severity level.  The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0, at which point it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer**.  This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

#### Bloody Tears
This painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim. <br>
___
**Targets:** Any beast or humanoid <br>
**Trasmission:** The target drinks or submerges its face in water tainted with this disease <br>
**Saving Throw:** DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw <br>
**Incubation Time:** 1 day <br>
**Starting Severity:** 1 <br>
**Increasing Severity Rate:** Every 24 Hours <br>
**Save DC Modifier:** 0 <br>
**Reversible Severity:** False <br>
**Cures:**  Bloody tears can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. When applied to the eyes, one dose of the ointment prevents the disease from worsening for the next 24 hours. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely. <br>
**Severity Levels:**

* **Severity 1-4:**  The creature takes a penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight equal to the severity level of the disease.
* **Severity 5:** The creature takes a −5 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight and suffers from the blinded condition.

\columnbreak

#### Cackle Fever 
This disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its Common name and its morbid nickname: “the shrieks.”<br>
___
**Targets:** Any non-gnome humanoid <br>
**Trasmission:** A target starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter<br>
**Saving Throw:** DC 10 Constitution Saving Throw <br>
**Incubation Time:** 1d4 hours <br>
**Starting Severity:** 3 <br>
**Increasing Severity Rate:** Every 24 Hours <br>
**Save DC Modifier:** -1 <br>
**Reversible Severity:** True <br>
**Cures:** Sucking on a lemon blessed by a gnomish priest <br>
**Severity Levels:**

* **Severity 1-3:** Any event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC Constitution saving throw against the disease's saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success. A creature that fails three of these Saving Throws within 24 hours gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described DMG.

#### Giant's Bane
This disease causes its host's muscles to weaken and become useless.  This affliction is said to have plagued giants for ages and can be contracted by humanoids. <br>
___
**Targets:** Any giant or humanoid<br>
**Trasmission:** A target ends its turn within 5 feet of an infected creature.  Giants have disadvantage on the saving throw to avoid infection.  <br>
**Saving Throw:** DC 14 Constitution Saving Throw <br>
**Incubation Time:** 1 day <br>
**Starting Severity:** 1 <br>
**Increasing Severity Rate:** Every 24 Hours <br>
**Save DC Modifier:** +1 <br>
**Reversible Severity:** True <br>
**Cures:**   The tooth of a dragon old enough to at least be considered an adult.  The tooth must be ground down and consumed by the infected creature. <br>
**Severity Levels:**

* **Severity 1:** The infected creature makes ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use its Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength modifier with disadvantage.

* **Severity 2:** The infected creature suffers the effects of Severity 1, and damage dealt by its weapon attacks that use Strength are halved.

* **Severity 3:** The creature falls prone and is paralyzed.

Sewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps and are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as **rats** and **otyughs**.<br>
___
**Targets:** Any humanoid or beast (other types of creatures might carry the disease but suffer no symptoms) <br>
**Trasmission:** A target is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease <br>
**Saving Throw:** DC 11 Constitution Saving Throw <br>
**Incubation Time:** 1d4 days <br>
**Starting Severity:** 1 <br>
**Increasing Severity Rate:** Every 24 Hours <br>
**Save DC Modifier:** 0 <br>
**Reversible Severity:** True <br>
**Cures:** The creature must drink a flask's worth of holy water and go 24 hours without eating or drinking anything else.  <br>
**Severity Levels:**

* **Severity 1-6:**  The infected creature regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending hit dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.  It also suffers a level of exhaustion for each severity level of its symptoms.  This exhaustion can’t be removed until the disease is cured.

## Abyssal Rot (Condensed)
If you want to incorporate Abyssal Rot into your games because it’s used by demons of decay, but you don’t want to use the rules for diseases, you can refer to the description for Abyssal Rot below. This description is a streamlined version that doesn’t require knowledge of the disease mechanics described previously. 

### Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. An hour after becoming infected, the victim begins displaying symptoms, and the Severity Level of the disease becomes 1. 

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while displaying symptoms, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

Every hour after the creature first displays symptoms, it repeats the saving throw against the disease, but with the save DC 1 higher than the last time the creature made the save. If the creature fails the saving throw, the Severity Level increases by 1, and it takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus the disease’s Severity Level.

If the disease reduces a creature’s hit point maximum to 0, it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer**. This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

The healing touch ability of an angel or other celestial will instantly cure Abyssal Rot.

<br>

> ##### Secret Infection Rolls 
>When a player character must make a saving throw to determine if they are infected by a disease, it is usually better for the GM to make the roll in secret since the character won’t know they’re infected. <br> A Wisdom (Medicine) check can be made to determine if a creature has been infected before it starts displaying symptoms. For Abyssal Rot, a DC of 15 for this check is an appropriate baseline, though you may alter it for other diseases and circumstances.<br>
Subsequent rolls made to determine if the player character fights off the effects of the disease should usually be made by the player.

# Demons of Decay
Demons represent the dark, chaotic <br> impulses of humanity made manifest. <br> Different demons represent different <br> aspects of this darkness, but none are <br> as revolting as the demons of decay. <br>  These demons are born from the <br> tendency of mortals to neglect <br> themselves and the world they live in, thus allowing <br> disease and entropy to run their course unopposed. <br> In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to <br> spread plagues and decay.  On others, they act in service to <br> a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of rot and disease.   

***Unnatural Vitality.*** Demons of decay are easily recognized by their bloated, rotting, disease-ridden forms.  The decaying nature of their bodies does not mean these fiends are fragile or easy to slay.  Demons of decay can shrug off incredible amounts of punishment relative to their size while their would-be slayers slowly succumb to terrible afflictions.  Many who worship these demons do so in hopes of gaining this unnatural vitality, even if it means subjecting themselves to horrific rot and disease.

***Cheerful Nihilists.***  Demons of decay represent the inevitable deterioration of all things.  Those who have succumbed to nihilism and apathy are especially vulnerable to their influence.  Yet, these demons and their followers are almost always jolly and cheerful.  They revel in the pointlessness of life and celebrate the perpetual state of rot to which existence is subject.  Those who worship these fiends often seek a means of escaping despair and fear of death, and by accepting the gifts of rot and disease, these worshippers cheerfully shed all their worries and woes.

<br><br><br>

> ##### The Dazed Condition
> Several of the abilities of these demons inflict the Dazed condition. A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.**

<br>

***Promoters of Life.***  The dark irony of these fiends is their genuine love of life.  They hold a motherly love for all living things, including diseases and parasites, which they fail to see as any less important than other lifeforms.  These fiends cast no judgments on the intrinsic worth of any lifeform and hold a deadly parasite in just as much esteem as a humanoid whom they believe should provide a home for as many parasites as possible.  

They spread diseases not out of malice but out of a desire to see life thrive, even if it is in the form of a plague.  Those who resist diseases, or worse, cure them, are seen as cruel destroyers of life by these fiends and their followers.  Death and decay are inevitable, and the best one can do is provide a loving home for as many other forms of life as possible while letting go of the need to hold onto what can't be maintained.

## Plague Bearers of Decay


These fiends are created from the souls of mortals who have succumbed to demonic diseases. Their shambling humanoid bodies are bloated, rotten, and nearly zombie-like in appearance. Each of these fiends wields a rusted plaguesword, which carries the same disease that originally birthed it and is used to continue the proliferation of its kind. Those wounded by the sword risk contracting Abyssal Rot, a fiendish disease that transforms those who succumb to it into other plague bearers.

Plague bearers feel the responsibility not just to spread disease but to count and catalog all diseases they encounter in hopes of establishing a complete record of every pathogen in existence.  Despite the impossible nature of this task, these neurotic fiends can often be heard counting illnesses they spot on the battlefield, groaning in frustration every time a distraction causes them to lose count.   

***Exalted Plague Bearers.*** Some plague bearers are significantly more powerful than their kin. These demons may have been particularly hardy mortals who fought off their fiendish infection for longer before finally succumbing, or they may be plague bearers who’ve survived long enough to earn the favor of their demon god. These “exalted” plague bearers are harder to kill, carry more virulent diseases, and possess greater levels of martial skill.

***Festering Stooges.*** These plague bearers have been “blessed” with clouds of hungry flies that follow them wherever they go. The flies constantly distract the stooge from any tasks it tries to concentrate on, and it often makes fruitless attempts at shooing them away or attempting to count and name them all. These constant distractions result in festering stooges always appearing clumsy and scatterbrained. 

Through some combination of bad luck and poor judgment, they often stumble into precarious situations that would spell the doom of most creatures. Luckily, their flies offer protection and regenerative abilities, ensuring that these stooges usually survive as they meander their way from one bubbling situation to the next.

***Plague Bearer Commanders.*** The most powerful plague bearers become leaders of entire hordes of entire rotting demons. They possess an ease and joviality at odds with their more serious kin and happily guide what they see as their fiendish family from one “party” to the next, spreading plagues and good cheer. The plague-ridden are lesser commanders who lead small parties of rotting demons, while heralds of decay are mighty lords who can shepherd teeming hordes of festering fiends.

<br>

> ##### Plague Riders
> If you wish to have any type of plague bearer you're using ride a controlled mount, you can give it the following trait:<br> ***Plague Rider.*** If the plague bearer has a controlled mount that is also a demon of decay, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the plague bearer’s turns.

These commanders draw power from the infections their kin spreads and happily share this power back with their fellow demons, continuing the cycle of life and death as they spread disease, draw power from the disease, and use that power to spread more disease. These mighty fiends are so infused with the powers of decay that they possess limited, but powerful, magical abilities that they can use to rapidly poison and rot away even the hardiest of adventurers.


#### Locus of Rot Abilities
The plague bearers who serve as commanders draw power from the infections of those around them and pass that power onto the demons they lead. Every plague-ridden and herald of decay has one of the following abilities.

***Locus of Fecundity.*** The plague bearer and each demon of decay within 30 feet of it regains 5 hit points at the start of the plague bearer’s turn per each non-demon of pestilence creature infected with Abyssal Rot within 30 feet of the plague bearer, up to a maximum of 20 hit points.
 
 ***Locus of Virulence*** The plague bearer and each demon of decay within 30 feet of it have advantage on attack rolls against creatures infected with Abyssal Rot.

***Locus of Contagion*** When a creature fails a saving throw against the Fetid Stench or Gloom of Flies abilities of a demon of decay while within 30 feet of the plague bearer, it is infected with Abyssal Rot.

### Death's Heads

These vile weapons a created from the skulls of those who have succumbed to demons of decay. They are thrown like grenades that explode into clouds of rot and disease. You may equip a plague bearer exalted plague bearer, or a festering stooge with 3 death heads. If you do, increase its CR by 1. The equipt creature can throw a death’s head as an Attack action or in place of an attack that’s part of its multiattack action.

#### New Magic Item: Death's Head
*Wondrous item, uncommon*<br>
As an action, if you are not restrained or grappled, you can hurl this item at a point you can see within 30 feet that is not behind total cover. The death’s head detonates at this point, and each creature within 10 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a DC 15 Constituion saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13 (3d8) necrotic damage and becomes infected by Abyssal Rot (description in Disease Mechanics section). On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t infected.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the death’s head, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the death’s head, and it detonates at your location.

#### Tactics: Plague Bearers of Decay

The rank-and-file of these demons have straightforward tactics. They simply want to surround players en masse so they will be overwhelmed by their demonic stench and then use their melee attacks to infect as many players as possible. Grouping up is generally to their advantage as it empowers their Fetid Stench ability. 

While staying together in a loose group, plague bearer will distribute their attacks amongst players to attempt to infect as many of them as possible. Plague bearers can sense when a player has been successfully infected, and they focus their attacks on the uninfected. Once all players are infected, they will usually prioritize whichever players have been overcome by their Fetid Stench.

As with all demons of decay, plague bearers will make slaying healers their priority, especially anyone curing diseases.

If a plague bearer has death heads at its disposal, it will hang back and bombard non-infected players from afar until it runs out of ammo and needs to close into melee.

##### Exalted Plague Bearers
These elite demons generally use the same tactics as their lesser kin. Their ranged attacks give them greater flexibility in who they can target, and they may opt to stay out of melee range of players if approaching is difficult or there are players well out of melee reach they want to attempt to infect.

##### Festering Stooges 

These strange demons will attempt to position themselves to subject as many players as possible to the effect of their Gloom of Flies. If the players are all spread out, they will go after the player with the fewest escape options. If a stooge is near death, it will try to position itself in a way that the cloud of flies it leaves behind will be difficult or inconvenient for players to avoid.

##### Plague-Ridden and Heralds of Decay
These demons act as leaders to other demons of decay and will wade into the thick of combat where they can put their locus ability to best use. Using locus traits to their maximum potential means ideally being near several infected players and other demons of decay at the same time. 

They possess several spells they can use to turn the tide of battle in their favor.


***Plague-Ridden Spells.***

***Cloudkill.*** This is a perfect opening spell that can be used to force ranged players out of advantageous positions and closer into melee range. If the plague-ridden can hit two or more players with this spell before they’ve moved into melee range, they will.

***Inflict Rot.*** This spell is ideal when the players are grouped together and tied up in melee combat. The plague-ridden will target the player that appears to have the lowest constitution, avoiding fighters and barbarians. 

***Blight.*** This is usually the last spell the plague-ridden will cast, and it will prioritize players infected with Abyssal Rot or under the effects of the Inflict Rot spell in an attempt to quickly subdue them.

\columnbreak

***Herald of Decay Spells.***

***Circle of Death.*** The herald will cast this spell as soon as it can hit three or more players with it. Since demons of decay are immune to necrotic damage, it doesn’t have to worry about them being within the spell’s area.

***Harm.*** This is a good opening spell when the herald hasn’t yet gotten into melee range. The herald is good at intuiting the saving throw capabilities of players and will target someone it doesn’t think is likely to pass the save.

***Regenerate.*** The herald will usually cast this on itself if it is below half health and supporting multiple minions with its locus ability. If there is another particularly powerful demon it is fighting alongside, it may opt to target that demon to keep it in the fight longer.

### Plague Bearer Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Plague Bearer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Plaguelings

These tiny disease-ridden fiends look like malevolent  children twisted into rotting monsters. Their gaping mouths drool greenish slime as they cackle like wicked infants, dancing about and looking for new playthings. Plagulings spawn from within greater demons of decay, growing within the putrid flesh of their parent demon, drawing sustenance from the bile and disease their host offers. Once the plagueling has grown to the size of a bloated infant, it erupts into the world, looking for more sustenance. Many plaguelings remain with their demon hosts, acting like coddled children, always looking for food and attention from their demonic caretaker. 


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***Burrowing Parasites.*** Plaguelings retain the ability to burrow within other willing creatures. This is done through supernatural means that don’t harm the host, though most mortals would find the process horribly disturbing. Demons of decay are often hosts to entire swarms of plaguelings that can burst forth at a moment’s notice.

***Pestilent Mischief Makers.*** Plaguelings prefer to stay near the protection of other demons of decay, but should one find itself on its own, it will seek out the nearest humanoid settlement to make mischief. Though a lone plagueling is little threat in combat, it can sneak through a town and threaten its inhabitants’ health by spoiling food, poisoning water, and spreading sickness to children and animals.

***Overwhelming Numbers.*** Plaguelings are social creatures and prefer to congregate into swarms. When they reach these numbers, they go from hazardous nuisances to deadly threats. Plaguelings in a swarm can work together to move at much higher speeds than any one plagueling could individually as they glom onto each other and roll together in a tide of flesh and filth. When they reach their targets, the plaguelings latch onto their new playmates like children climbing on their parents, dragging them down and subjecting them to all manner of grizzly diseases. 

***Swarming Steeds.*** Bizarrely enough, demons of decay often use swarms of plaguelings as perverse steeds, allowing the writhing mass to carry them into battle. These swarms often hide inside the demon until it has need for them. A demon of decay that sees foes at a distance may suddenly vomit forth a swarm of plaguelings that quickly pick it up and carry it to its victims at rapid speed. Other demons may allow foes to close in on them and allow themselves to appear outnumbered. Only when the fiends start regurgitating swarms of revolting plaguelings, do their attackers release the grave miscalculation they’ve made.

#### Tactics: Plaguelings
Plaguelings are primarily focused on making mischief. A lone plagueling will never attack the players. Instead, it will most likely stalk them until they make camp. At that point, it will perform acts of mischief such as eating their rations, spreading disease-ridden filth across their belongings, or even biting a sleeping player to infect them with disease.

A plagueling acting in service to another creature can be quite helpful in combat despite having little fighting ability. Plaguelings can use their Noxious Cradle ability to hide within their master and pop out at a moment's notice to use the Help action. They may also attempt to sneak up on players and make a bite attack from hiding to gain advantage on the attack and potentially infect their target.

##### Plagueling Swarms.
Swarms enjoy hiding within other creatures and pop out at a moment's notice to overwhelm players who've been caught off guard. A few seemingly outnumbered plague bringers can suddenly unleash waves of plaguelings to aid them in battle.

Plagueling swarms can also act as surprise mounts. If a plague bringer carrying them needs to close a distance quickly, the swarm can pop out, pick up the plague bringer, and move 75 feet, all in the same turn. Plague bringers can use this to close in on players quickly and potentially even reach squishier players who thought they were a safe distance away. Once the plague bearer reaches its desired target, the plagueling swarm will generally wander off and start harassing players by attacking and attaching to them.

##### Plagueling Tides.
These massive swarms function in much the same way as smaller swarms. The key difference is that they can grapple multiple creatures, so they will be incentivized to grab hold of as many players as possible once they make their entrance.

### Plagueling Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Plagueling Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Plague Toads
These wretched fiends appear as giant, mutant, <br> disease-ridden toads with one or more boney horns protruding from their bulbous heads. Their rotting <br> skin is always sloughing off of them and spreads <br> terrible diseases to those who come in contact with it.

Plague toads spawn in the vilest swamps of the <br> demon realms. There, they lazily waddle and hop <br> about, looking for the next easy meal while avoiding <br> the attention of more powerful demons. The desire <br> to avoid the wrath of other demons while finding <br> easy prey leads plague toads to leap at any chance to <br> cross into the mortal realm. Here they take up residence <br>  in foul sewers and fetid swamps, feeding on humanoids <br> at every opportunity while spreading filth and disease in <br>  their wake.

Demonic cultists of decay will often summon plague <br> toads to serve as guardians in their lairs, and when  other demons of decay launch large-scale attacks, they will often herd knots of plague toads into battle alongside them. <br>  Some plague bearer demons even catch plague toads for themselves and put them to use as combat mounts. Though they aren't the fastest of steeds, plague toads can leap over obstacles and ram foes with their boney horns, knocking prey off their feet before quickly gobbling them up.

> ***Leap Attack.*** If the toad jumps at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the toad can make a bite attack against it as a bonus action.
>
> ***Miasma of Rot.*** The toad emits a toxic cloud which extends 5 feet out from it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become infected with Wasting Sickness disease. While infected with the disease, a creature has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws. An infected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of a short or long rest, ending the disease on a success and becoming immune to the Wasting Sickness of all bog barons for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Living Plague.*** The toad is immune to diseases, and if it is targeted by a spell or effect that cures disease, such as Lay on Hands or *lesser restoration*, it takes 20 radiant damage. 
>
> ***Standing Leap.*** The toad's long jump is up to 40 feet and its high jump is up to 20 ft., with or without a running start.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Tongue.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (5d6) necrotic damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the toad, which can immediately use its bonus action to make a bite attack against the target.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the toad can't use its bite attack or tongue attack on another target.
>
> ***Swallow.*** The toad makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and at the start of each of the toad’s turns, its Strength score is reduced by 1d6 and is affected by the toad’s Miasma of Rot. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>



***Bog Barons.*** Though all plague toads are bloated bags of disease, these toads have been blessed with a particularly potent disease that radiates from the toad's rotting skin in a vile miasma. This disease is commonly referred to as "wasting sickness" and withers away the muscle mass of its victims, eventually weakening them to the point where they can no longer breath or beat their heart.

Carrying this disease marks these plague toads with a higher status in their swamp homes, thus earning them the nickname of bog barons. Plague bearers see the bog barons as particularly valuable mounts, and those who have successfully captured them will form elite gangs of fetid shock cavalry.

#### Plague Toads in Your Adventures

#### Tactics: Plague Toads
These fiends are dimwitted predators that rely more on instinct than learned tactics. They have various combat options, but if plague toads aren’t commanded by more intelligent creatures, their default goal will be to gulp down the easiest-to-swallow humanoid in sight and hop away so its new meal can be properly digested. 

Plague toads prefer to hunt in bogs or other toxic environments filled with water and difficult terrain that they can easily navigate through hopping and swimming. They may try to sneak up on prey, but their mobility lets them easily catch up to most quarry in these environments even if they are spotted.

A plague toad has four types of attacks, and will choose the one that best fits its circumstances.

**Bite.** The toad will use this attack if it is in melee range and wants to attempt to grapple and escape with a player in tow. This is not an ideal action since it should try to get a bite in as part of its Leap Attack or Togue action.

**Gore.** The toad will generally only use this as part of its Leap Attack feature. Its Leap Attack is how it prefers to engage players in combat, and it may even provoke opportunity attacks if it means leaping into more favorable terrain or landing a Leap Attack against a more vulnerable player.

**Swallow.** The toad will almost always attempt to swallow a creature it has grappled. Once it’s done so, it will start using Dash actions to flee the battle.

**Tongue.** The toad will use this attack to hit players it can’t quite reach with its other attacks. It may also rely on its tongue to avoid leaping into unfavorable terrain or being surrounded.

##### Plague Toads as Steeds
Plague toads being used as steeds by plague bearers will use more sophisticated tactics, using tongue and bite attacks to grapple and pull players into unfavorable terrain. Separating players in this way also makes it harder for them to free anyone who has been swallowed. 

##### Bog Barons
These toads use mostly the same tactics, except they are more willing to leap into the middle of players to subject multiple targets to their Miasma of Rot ability. They can sense which players are suffering from their Wasting Sickness and will focus their attacks on them.

### Plagueling Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Plague Toad Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Beasts of Decay

These disgusting and ungainly fiends <br> lurch across the ground with their slug-like <br> bodies, bringing rot and death to everyone <br> in their path.  The beast's legless lower body <br> is topped with a vaguely humanoid upper <br> body, and its head features a slobbering <br> tongue and leech-like hair that constantly <br> spews toxins.  Though their bodies appear <br> bloated and awkward, beasts of decay have <br> no trouble pulling  themselves toward any <br> creature that catches their attention, <br> leaving  a trail of acidic slime in their wake. 

Despite the beast of decay's horrid <br> appearance and deadly nature, it is a jovial <br> and affectionate fiend, virtually incapable of <br> viewing any other creature as an enemy. <br> "Enemies" are simply potential playmates, <br> and the beast is eager to earn their affection <br> with big slobbering licks.  The fact that these <br> licks rot, kill, and bring untold suffering to <br> their "playmates" is beyond the beast's <br> understanding. A creature killed this way is <br> transformed into another demon of decay, <br> thus providing the beast with a more <br> permanent playmate.

#### Tactics: Beast of Decay
Plague beasts behave playfully and don’t even realize they’re in combat. To them, they’re just bounding up and greeting new friends. Most other demons commanding them won’t attempt to curb their nature. As such, plague beasts should be played more randomly and chaotically rather than tactically. They will rush headlong toward the first player they see using their Attention Seeker feature. If they reach their target with extra movement left, they can begin circling the player like an excited dog, leaving a slime trail around their new friend. It will then start making use of its Erratic Attacks.

The beast will hyper-focus on one player at a time and may randomly decide to sprint after another target when its focus shifts. You can represent this by rolling a d4 at the start of each of its turns and, on a result of 4, having the beast direct its attention to the next nearest player.

### Beast of Decay Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

## Rot Flies

These malevolent fiends possess <br> a cruelty counter to the usual jovial <br> nature of most demons of decay. <br> These demons resemble giant flies <br> the size of horses and possess bladed <br> arms and massive stingers capable of <br> delivering enormous dosages of venom. <br> But the most disturbing of all the rot fly's <br> weapons is its deadly proboscis, capable <br> of dissolving flesh and devouring its victim's <br> head. The heads devoured this way are digested <br> down to their skulls, which are transformed into <br> fiendish grenade-like weapons known as death's <br> heads. The rot flies expel these death's heads which <br> are used by other demons of decay to slay masses of foes.

The rot fly can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the rot fly by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check.

The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If it fails the repeated saving throw by 5 or more (DC 10), it is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

It is said that rot flies were once beasts of decay that were repeatedly slain in the mortal realm by those they tried to share their deadly affection with. The beasts of decay sought out new mortal friends but were cut down by these would-be companions. Bitterness grew in the hearts of the beasts, and when they reformed on their demonic home plain, that bitterness warped them into rot flies. Rot flies that make their way into the Material Plane are said to seek the mortals who previously slew them and prioritize exacting vengeance at all costs unless they are being controlled by a powerfully strong-willed master. 

Plague bearers who have such a will may use rot flies as mounts. These plague bearers are known as plague drones and are notorious for raining down death's head bombs on their foes before swooping in with their deadly rot flies to pick off stragglers.

#### Tactics: Rot Flies

Rot flies exist to inflict pain on mortals. When acting of their own accord, they will prioritize attacking the closest mortal creature they can see unless they are aware of the presence of a creature who has killed them before. In this case, their highest priority will be hunting down that creature.

The rot fly has multiple attack options and will use different attacks under different circumstances.

**Stinger.** This is the rot fly's preferred opening attack. If a player poisoned by the stinger manages to save against it on a later turn, the rot fly will usually try to reapply the poison. It will not waste its time trying to poison creatures that appear to have high Constituion.

**Blade Legs.** The rot fly will use blade leg attacks against creatures it fails to poison with its stinger or gain advantage on attacks against. If the creature it's fighting looks like it has low Strength, it may replace one of its multi-attacks with a shove to knock its victim prone to gain advantage on the second attack.

**Proboscis.** The rot fly will use this against creatures it has advantage on attacks against.
If the rot fly is being ridden by plague bearers, the plague bearers will direct it toward backline players, such as spell casters. The plague bearers will use their actions to help give the rot fly advantage on its attacks against its victim so it can use its proboscis attack to attach to its target. The plague bearer can do this through Help actions and shove attacks to knock creatures prone if they appear to have low Strength.   

### Rot Fly Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Rot Fly Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Great Unclean Ones

 These jolly greater demons are masters of rot and disease, which they happily spread to anyone they meet.  They have the appearance of massive, bloated corpses with entrails spilling forth from their open wounds and slimy horns topping their grinning, oversized heads. This enormous body constantly oozes acidic slime and debilitating gasses, and its rotting girth makes it difficult to meaningfully damage. Once it is in motion, the unclean one can easily crush other creatures under the momentum of its vile flesh, all while laughing merrily. 

Unclean ones wield rusted and decaying weapons, crusted with filth and disease, and their dreaded blades deliver an affliction that can transform victims into new demons of decay.  Enemies outside the reach of an unclean one's weapons are no safer, for these fiends can vomit streams of rotting bile over ridiculous distances.  These deadly combat abilities are supplemented by the unclean one's powerfully putrescent magic, which specializes in rotting and poisoning enemies as well as restoring vitality to its fellow demons.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

While an unclean one's presence inevitably brings death and decay, it behaves as though it is at a grand party.  There is a joyousness to its actions, and its diseases, spells, and attacks are simply how it spreads good cheer.  The unclean one has a parental fondness for its followers, and those who have given themselves over to the influence of these demons view their afflictions as loving presents.  Together they spread their pestilent gifts far and wide as they revel in the decay of all things.

The grandest and most accomplished of unclean ones are sometimes elevated to the status of exalted unclean ones. This is a rare occurrence for the unclean one must prove itself to be an unparalleled master of spreading pestilence and good cheer in equal measure before it has any chance of ascending to this level. Those who prove worthy become among the most powerful demons of decay in existence, leading legions of their foul brethren, spreading plagues beyond counting, and hosting pestilent festivals of legendary status.

### Demonic Gifts

You can choose any two of the following features to add to the stat block of the great unclean one or exalted unclean one. The default stat blocks have Slime Trail and Noxious Vapors.

1. ***Slime Trail.*** Any land the unclean one, or a demon of decay it is mounted on, occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain for one minute. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage for every 5 feet it travels. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 7 (3d4) acid damage. Demons of decay ignore the effects of the slime.

2. ***Noxious Vapors.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the unclean one must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature's speed is halved and it is dazed. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Noxious Vapors of all demons of decay for 1 hour.

3. ***Infestation.*** At the start of each of the unclean one's turns, it heals a plagueling swarm or plagueling tide of its choice within 10 feet of it for 34 hit points. This healing ignores the swarm rule regarding healing. <br> If there are no such swarms within 10 feet of the unclean one below full health, it instead creates a plagueling swarm with 17 hit points inside itself as though the swarm used its ***Noxious Cradle*** ability to enter inside the unclean one. The new swarm has its own initiative and takes its turn right after the unclean one. The unclean one can have up to three swarms created by this ability at a time.

4. ***Bloated Pustules.*** The first time each turn that the unclean one is hit with an attack, puss spews out in a 15-foot cube originating from the unclean one in the direction of the attacker. Each creature in the area of the cube takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

### Uncle Cruncle
This demon is particularly unusual, even for an unclean one. Cruncle refers to himself as everyone’s uncle and is always in search of anyone to share his stories, knickknacks, and weird humor with. He would say he oozes charm, but it’s mostly noxious bodily fluids. Any time he finds a new audience, Uncle Cruncle rushes to greet them with awkward jokes and strange gifts no one in their right mind would want. These gifts are random curiosities he acquires during his journeys and stores in places better left unmentioned. Those who reject Cruncle’s gifts and attempts at entertainment tend to find themselves on the receiving end of his latest knickknack. 

Uncle Cruncle’s favorite gift is his own personal contagion he’s dubbed Uncle’s Bloat. It subjects its recipients to a painful form of gigantism, expanding their size and leaving them horribly gassy. This condition makes it much easier to subject his audience to the bodily fluids he leaves wherever he goes.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### *Hey mortal, pull my finger!* <br> - Uncle Cruncle

<br>

Cruncle always finds new ways to subject others to his bodily functions, from his classic “sick shooter” to his latest trick, dubbed “The Chocolate Fountain.”  Never one to horde his abilities, Cruncle can spread the joy by inducing these same performances in others, thus covering huge areas in vile fluids. As these fluids rot away other creatures, they sustain and rejuvenate Cruncle, turning him into an unceasing mass of contagions, bodily functions, and insufferable jokes.

#### Tactics: Unclean Ones

These monsters act as leaders and elite demons among their kind. They have very high mental stats, making them master tacticians who know exactly which players will be weakest against their diseases and who will be able to cure said diseases and thus need to be slain first.

Though unclean ones have many combat options, their priority will almost always be to get into melee range of players as quickly as possible to begin whittling away their vitality. Mountain of Loathsome flesh is good for closing distance this way. If the unclean one can’t get into melee range, it will start using noxious bile attacks or cast horrid wilting if the players are grouped up. 

Once it is in melee range, the unclean one will hit as many players as possible with its bilesword to create as many infections as it can. It will then start infecting players with *rancid visitations*. The unclean will start with players with the lowest chance of succeeding on Constitution saving throws. If there’s someone actively removing diseases, the unclean one will focus on that player with its bilesword attacks. 

By default, unclean ones will use their Blubber and Bile reaction whenever they take 50 or more damage from a single attack. If they know a player can deal massive radiant or fire damage, such as a paladin with smite attacks, they will usually save Blubber and Bile for these attacks.

Unclean ones have the following spells they can use once per day:

***Cloudkill.*** Use this to block ranged attackers proving problematic. It can also be used against grouped-up players if *horrid wilting* is no longer available. 

***Dispel Magic.*** Use this to remove any spell that is hampering the unclean one’s action economy.

***Finger of Death.*** Use this to finish off any creature outside of melee range and near death. Creatures infected with Abyssal Rot are also perfect targets if the unclean one thinks it can kill them outright.

***Heal.*** Use this to cure the unclean one of the blinded condition, or if it looks like it can defeat the players through a battle of attrition and it needs some extra hit points to make it the rest of the way. Consider using it once the unclean one is missing 90 or more hit points.

&emsp;***Horrid Wilting.*** This spell can be a good opening attack if the unclean one can’t get into melee range and several players are grouped up. Otherwise, it will wait to use it until it can hit two players infected with Abyssal Rot or at least four players altogether. 

***Locate Creature.*** The unclean one will use this to find lovely new specimens outside combat.

##### Exalted Unclean Ones
These greater demons use most of the same tactics as their lesser kind. The primary difference is in the use of their Virulent Contagion and Pestilent Decay legendary actions. Virulent Contagion should be used to accelerate the rate at which the unclean one spreads diseases. Pestilent Decay should be used whenever three or more players are infected with diseases or one player is suffering the full effects of the *contagion* spell. If there’s a player curing diseases, Virulent Contagion can be used to target players far away from the healer, making curing diseases as difficult as possible.

\columnbreak

##### Uncle Cruncle
This strange unclean one varies slightly from other unclean ones in his combat tactics. He tries to move around the battlefield, spreading his Defiling Deluge while infecting as many players with Uncle’s Bloat as possible. Once the majority of players are infected, he will primarily use *spirit leech* to help him outlast the players and focus his attacks on any players limiting his mobility or preventing him from healing.

**Gut Check.** Cruncle will use this legendary action whenever he can potentially push a player through at least two 5-foot squares affected by his Defilling Deluge. He can also use this to position players affected by Uncle’s Bloat next to other players so he can hit more targets with his Spew Poo Party legendary action.

**Spew Poo Party.** This is an ideal legendary action to use on Cruncle whenever he’s in an area unaffected by Defiling Deluge. He can also target players infected with Uncle’s Bloat whenever they’re in unaffected areas.

#### Tactics: The Plaguefather
The Plaguefather’s primary goal is to experiment with his diseases. As such, his priority is to infect as many players at any one time as possible. He isn’t concerned with trying to kill anyone as quickly as possible unless they are destroying his experiments or have a natural resistance to disease, in which case they break through his scientific detachment and drive him to try and slay them as quickly as possible.

The Plaguefather’s tactics are the polar opposite of most unclean ones. Rather than jumping into the fray, he will try to stay as far from the players as possible while keeping them in line of sight. Here, he will bombard them with his necrotic missiles. He will usually be riding a plagueling tide which he uses as a controlled mount. He will stay on this mount whenever possible and have it take Dash and Disengage actions to keep him out of melee reach of his foes. The slime trail he leaves behind as he moves makes pursuit that much more difficult. 

Below are some of his key abilities and how he is most likely to use them.

**Infestation.** He will prioritize using this ability to heal the swarm carrying him. If it doesn’t need to be healed, he will create a new swarm to send after the players to bog them down.

**Swarm Surge.** This ability will be used on his mount to remove him from melee combat. He may also use it on a plagueling tide grappling players to move them into an unfavorable position.

**Summon Plaguelings.** He will use this ability if he is not in immediate danger, and will usually prioritize players who fit the following criteria. 
* The creature is of a race or class with a natural resistance to disease (such as a dwarf or paladin.)
* The creature already has a plagueling swarm or tide in its space.
* The creature is curing diseases.
* The creature is close enough to present a melee threat.

### Unclean One Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Unclean One Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## The Plaguefather
The mightiest of all the unclean ones and the single most powerful demon of decay in existence is known as the Plaguefather. His rotting girth puts that of other unclean ones to shame, and he is usually seen carried upon a massive palanquin by writhing hordes of plaguelings. 

The Plaguefather is unique among other unclean ones as he focuses not only on spreading existing plagues but also on concocting new ones to unleash upon the world. He toils away at his massive cauldron, brewing and concocting new experimental diseases to unleash upon the world. The Plaguefather takes every chance he can to roam the Material Plane in search of specimens to use in his experiments and to test his diseases against any hapless mortals he encounters. He has a special interest in crafting plagues to infect those normally immune to disease and dreams of one day creating a contagion capable of infecting the gods.

In combat, The Plaguefather possesses ungodly resilience, tremendous strength, and swarms of plagueling attendants. The most dangerous of these plaguelings are those he keeps with him at all times to use as carriers for his latest experimental diseases. At a moment’s notice, The Plaguefather can pull a plagueling from his bowls, dunk it in a vial of disease, and hurl it at his foes. When the plagueling lands, it explodes in a noxious burst, infecting those in the blast radius with the plaguefather’s latest concoction. 

### The Plaguefather's Lair

The Plaguefather’s home serves as a garden to grow choice ingredients and a laboratory to host his twisted experiments. It is filled with living things laden with rot and forever on the brink of death. This lair is normally on his demonic home plane, but he may establish a lair in a location on the Material Plane where he wishes to conduct extended experiments.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the plaguefather can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

* The plaguefather chooses two creatures infected with his experimental diseases that he is aware of in his layer. He chooses one that must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it gains all the symptoms of the other creature.

* The plaguefather chooses a creature within his layer that he is aware of in his layer and forces it to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is infected with an experimental disease with a random symptom determined by the Experimental Disease Table on the page after the next.

* The plaguefather chooses one plagueling swarm he is aware of in his layer and causes them to begin bloating and expanding. At the end of the plagueling swarm’s next turn, it explodes and dies. Each creature within 15 feet of the plagueling swarm must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking acid damage equal to the hit points the swarm had when it died on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

> ___
>
>  ***Living Plague.*** The plaguefather is immune to diseases, and if he is targeted by a spell or effect that cures disease, such as Lay on Hands or *lesser restoration*, he takes 20 radiant damage.
>
> ***Corpulent Mass.*** The plaguefather regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes 20 or more fire or radiant damage in a single turn, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. The plaguefather dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
>
> ***Infestation.*** At the start of each of the plaguefather's turns, he heals a plagueling swarm or plagueling tide of his choice within 10 feet of him for 64 hit points. This healing ignores the swarm rule regarding healing. <br> If there are no such swarms within 10 feet of the plaguefather below full health, he instead creates a plagueling swarm with 34 hit points inside himself as though the swarm used its ***Noxious Cradle*** ability to enter inside the plaguefather. The new swarm has its own initiative and takes its turn right after the plaguefather. The plaguefather can have up to three swarms created by this ability at a time.
>
> ***Slime Trail.*** Any land the plaguefather, or a demon of decay he is mounted on, occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain for one minute. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage for every 5 feet it travels. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 7 (3d4) acid damage. Demons of decay ignore the effects of the slime.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The plaguefather makes two attacks. He can use a Necrotic Missile in place of one of his attacks.
>
> ***Slam*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (5d10 + 6)  bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Necrotic Missile.*** The plaguefather hurls an explosive plagueling at a point he can see within 300 feet that is not behind total cover. <br>
The plagueling detonates at this point, and each creature within 15 feet of it that's not behind total cover must make a DC 22 Constituion saving throw. <Br>
> On failure, a creature takes 40 (9d8) necrotic damage and becomes infected with an experimental disease with a symptom determined using the Experimental Disease Table on the next page. All creatures that fail the save are infected with the same disease. <br>
On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't infected. <br>
When the plaguefather uses this action, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against him as though he moved out of their reach. If a creature hits him this way, he drops the plagueling, and it detonates centered on his location.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Blubber and Bile.*** When the plaguefather takes damage, he halves the damage and then reduces it by 1d12.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The plaguefather can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The plaguefather regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
> 
> **Check.** The plaguefather makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
> 
> **Conglomerate.** Two plagueling swarms the plaguefather is aware of that have all their hit points and are within 5 feet of each other merge and become a plagueling tide. The plagueling tide has its own initiative and goes right after the plaguefather. If either of the plagueling swarms were attached to any creatures, those creatures are now grappled by the plagueling tide as though they’ve been hit by its bite attack. The plaguefather can only have one plagueling tide created this way at a time.
>
> **Summon Plaguelings.** The plaguefather targets a non-swarm creature within 300 feet that just ended its turn, causing a plagueling swarm with 34 hit points to appear centered on its location. If there is already a plagueling swarm or tide in that creature’s space, that swarm gains 34 hit points instead, and the creature that just ended its turn must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or be automatically hit by a bite attack from the swarm (no action required.) 
>
> **Swarm Surge.** A plagueling tide or swarm within 120 feet of the plaguefather moves up to its movement.
> 
> **Tenacious Will.** If the plaguefather is suffering from an effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of his next turn, he may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. He can use this legendary action while incapacitated.

#### Experimental Diseases

When a creature is subjected to an experimental disease, roll on the following table to determine the disease’s symptoms. If the creature is already suffering from an experimental disease, the resulting symptom is added to its existing infection. All diseases inflicted this way end when the plaguefather dies. <br> Creatures normally immune to disease can still be infected with these diseases but have advantage on their saves against infection.

##### Experimental Disease Table
| d20   |  Disease Symptom  |
|:-----:|:----------:|
|   1   |  The creature takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.| 
|   2   | The creature is poisoned.|
|   3   | The creature can't take reactions.|
|   4   | The creature can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.| 
|   5   | All attacks against the creature are made with advantage.| 
|   6   | The creature is unable to see anything farther than 10 feet away.| 
|   7   | Damage dealt by creature's attacks is halved.
|   8   | The creature's speed is halved.| 
|   9   | The creature is frightened of the plaguefather| 
|   10  | If the creature casts a spell that causes itself or another creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, the target gains half that may temporary hit points or hit points instead.| 
|   11  | The creature can't make more than one attack during its turn.|
|   12  | Attack rolls can't gain disadvantage against the creature.|
|   13  | On the creature's turn, it must choose whether it gets a move or an action; it can’t do both.|  
|   14  | At the start of each of the creature's turns, it loses any concentration it's maintaining.|
|   15  | The creature can't gain advantage on attack rolls or ability checks.|
|   16  | The creature becomes brittle. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits it is a critical hit.|
|   17  | If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.|
|   18  | The creature falls prone at the start of each of its turns and must use all of its movement to stand up.|
|   19  |  The creature is charmed by the plaguefather.|
|   20  | Demons of decay have advantage on saving throws against any spells the creature casts.|

#### Epic Plaguefather Battle
If you wish to make the plaguefather into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 868, and give him the following trait: <br>
>***Perfected Plague (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the plaguefather is reduced to half his hit points (434) or less, he may end any spells affecting him. Additionally, he chooses one symptom from the Experimental Disease Table. Any time a creature becomes infected by an experimental disease by him or from his lair actions, it gains the chosen symptom in addition to other symptoms the disease would inflict. 
>
> This ability lasts until the plaguefather completes a short or long rest.

#### The Plaguefather’s Magic
While the plaguefather is an unlean one, and all unclean ones have innate spellcasting abilities, those were not included in the stat block. The plaguefather’s spell casting ability was removed to keep the stat block from becoming too large and because he will generally be better off relying on his necrotic missiles than spells. But, if you wish to keep his abilities consistent and give him the option to use magic, you can give him the following spellcasting action. 

> ***Spellcasting.*** The plague father casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Wisdom as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks):
>
>***At will:*** *cloudkill*, *dispel magic*, *locate creature*, *rancid visitation**   
>
>***1/day each:*** *finger of death* (A creature killed by this spell becomes a **plague bearer of decay**), *heal*, *horrid wilting*
>
> **New spells found in Spells of Decay section*

# Decay Customization Options

## Demonic Abilities

This section lists different abilities you can add to creatures to make them more thematically aligned with a demonic theme. Each ability added to a creature increases its CR by 1. Though this isn’t an exact science, as different abilities will synergize better with some creatures than others, so use your best judgment.

A creature with a demonic ability is considered to be a creature of that ability’s theme, ex a creature with a demonic ability from the decay theme is a Creature of Decay.

Some of these abilities will require a saving throw. Use the CR of the creature with the ability to determine the DC for the save, as shown below:

* CR 4 or lower - DC 13 
* CR 5 to 8 - DC 15
* CR 9 to 12 - DC 17
* CR 13 to 16 - DC 18
* CR 17+ - DC 19

## Lair Actions of Decay

This section lists different lair actions you can give gifted creatures access to when they’re fighting at a location under the influence of their demonic patron.

These may be locations haunted by a demonic presence, such as a shrine devoted to a demon lord or a battlefield of interest to a particularly dark power. Those aligned with the dark influences of these locations can draw on their power to lay their enemies low.

You can give one or more creatures the ability to access two or more lair actions listed in this section that all belong to the same theme. Only one creature can take a lair action per round. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any creature with lair actions can take one lair action.

When you add lair actions to an encounter, you can treat the lair as an additional creature being added for the purposes of determining how it increases the encounter’s challenge rating. The equivalent CR of the lair depends on the average level of the players, as shown in the table below. If a lair action requires a saving throw, the DC of the save is determined by the equivalent CR of the lair. 

##### Lair Challenge Ratings (CRs)
| Party Level Range  | Lair CR | Lair Save DC |  
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1-4  | 1 | 13 |
|  5-8  | 2 | 15 |
|  9-12 | 3 |  17 |
|  13-16| 4 |   18 |
| 17-20 | 5 |  19 |

### Gifts of Decay

Creatures with any of these abilities are Creatures of Decay.

#### Bloating Corruption
*The creature's body is filled with foul gases, waiting to burst forth upon its death.*

When the gifted creature dies, it releases a cloud of toxic gas in a 10-foot radius around it that lasts for a minute. The area is treated as though it is under the effects of the *stinking cloud* spell.

#### Crumbling Pox
*The creature is teeming with lethal maladies that can be passed on to its enemies.*

Once during the gifted creature's turn, when it hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force that creature to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become infected with Crumbling Pox disease. While infected with Crumbling Pox, the creature gains one level of exhaustion at the end of each of its turns.

The disease can be cured if the creature regains 10 or more hit points or if a creature expends one use of a healer's kit on it. Alternatively, the diseased creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the disease on a success.

#### Encrusted Wounds
*The creature's wounds quickly scab over, forming a protective crust over its skin.*

When the gifted creature drops to half its hit points or fewer, it gains a +3 bonus to its AC for the next hour.

Once this ability triggers, it can’t do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Grasping Filth
*The creature oozes slime that sticks to anything it touches.*

Any land the gifted creature occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Any non-demon creature that enters the slime's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the slime. A creature can use its action to attempt to scrape or wash the sticky slime off itself or another creature, ending the effect with a successful Strength check. The freed creature can't be restrained again by the slime until the end of its next turn. Creatures of Decay ignore the effects of the slime.
 
 
#### Unnatural Renewal
*Just when the creature looks like it is slain, it falls apart into a pile of slime and mulch, only to reform in seconds.* 

If the gifted creature takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead regains all of it's hit points and falls prone, until the same intuitive count next turn, it is paralyzed and has vulnerability to all damage types that it does not have resistance or immune to. 
 
Once this ability triggers, it can’t do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Wax and Wane
*The creature's body constantly cycles between rejuvenation and decay, changing from one second to the next.*

When gifted creature rolls initiative, it rolls d6. On an odd number, it is in the Rot state, and on an even number, it is in the Abundance state.

At the end of its turns, it switches to the other state.

While in the Abundance state, the creature gains a +3 bonus to its armor class and saving throws.

While in the Rot state, the creature gains a +3 bonus to attack rolls.

Observers can tell what state the creature is in by looking at it. For example, the creature may appear haggard or moldy while in the Rot state and energetic and lively while in the Abundance state.

### Lair Actions of Decay

Any Creature that can use these lair actions is a Creature of Decay.

#### Bubo Bomb

A willing creature is covered in boils filled with rancid acid. If the creature dies, each creature within 10 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On initiative count 20 next turn, the boil-covered creature dies if it is still alive.

The acid damage dealt depends on the lair's, as shown below:

* **CR 1:** - 2d6 acid damage
* **CR 2:** - 4d6 acid damage
* **CR 3:** - 6d6 acid damage
* **CR 4:** - 8d6 acid damage
* **CR 5:** - 10d6 acid damage

#### Proliferate

The gifted creature coaxes the spread of contagions. The gifted creature chooses two creatures in the lair that can be seen, and one of them must make a Constitution saving throw. If it fails, it gains all the diseases of the other creature.

#### Rampant Rot

One creature of the gifted creature’s choice within the lair it is aware of must must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become infected by a rotting disease. 

On initiative count 20 each turn, each infected creature takes necrotic damage, then each infected creature along with every creature within 10 feet of an infected creature, must make a Constitution saving throw. Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

The necrotic damage dealt by the disease is dependent on the lair's CR, as shown below:

* **CR 1:** - 1d8 necrotic damage
* **CR 2:** - 2d8 necrotic damage
* **CR 3:** - 3d8 necrotic damage
* **CR 4:** - 4d8 necrotic damage
* **CR 5:** - 5d8 necrotic damage

#### Rot Blessing

The gifted creature becomes covered in pestilent growths, regaining hit points and becoming rot blessed. On initiative count 20 each turn, each rot blessed creature regains hit points equal to 10 times the lair's CR, and another Creature of Decay within 10 feet of it may gain the rot blessing as well. The rot blessing ends on a creature if it takes radiant or fire damage or is targeted by an effect that cures diseases.

#### Tree of Decay

The gifted creature selects an unoccupied 10-foot cube on the ground within the lair and causes a corrupted tree to grow there and fill up the space. The tree has an AC of 14, hit points determined by the CR of the gifted creature, and is immune to poison and necrotic damage.

 It releases an aura of corruption in a 10-foot radius, halving the speed of any non-Creature of Decay creature in the area. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage determined by the CR of the gifted creature. On a pass, the creature takes half as much damage. 

The tree’s hit points and necrotic damage based on the lair's CR as shown below:

* **CR 1:** 15 HP, 1d6 necrotic damage
* **CR 2:** 30 HP, 2d6 necrotic damage
* **CR 3:** 45 HP, 3d6 necrotic damage
* **CR 4:** 60 HP, 4d6 necrotic damage
* **CR 5:** 75 HP, 5d6 necrotic damage

#### Withering Disease

One creature of the gifted creature’s choice within the lair it is aware of must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become infected by a withering disease. 

On initiative count 20 each turn, each infected creature gains one level of exhaustion, then each infected creature along with every creature within 10 feet of an infected creature, must make a Constitution saving throw. Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

## Customizable Demons

The following demons aren’t aligned with a specific demonic theme but can be used as a baseline for adding gifts and other customizations to make them a part of a particular type of demonic force. They are often shaped by other fiendish influences which specialize them for service to their given demon patron. Otherwise, they can serve as “neutral” demons without a specific master or theme. 



### Chaos Fury

These wicked, winged demons personify the unpredictable and volatile nature of chaos. They stand roughly three to four feet tall, with lean, muscular bodies that can take on various appearances depending on the influence of the demons they serve. Their wide, leathery wings grant them impressive speed and agility in flight, while their long, sharp claws allow them to easily slice through vulnerable flesh. 

Chaos furies are believed to be lesser demons, birthed from the raw energies of the realm of chaos. Their malleable and subservient nature means they are often used as agents of chaos by more powerful demons, sowing discord and confusion before a larger demonic incursion. Despite their small size and seemingly low threat level, these creatures' unpredictable and opportunistic nature allows them to wreak havoc on larger enemies. Chaos furies are cowardly by nature and will wait until they see vulnerable or isolated foes before striking at lightning speed, using hit-and-run attacks to prevent their prey from mounting an effective counterattack.

Unlike many other demons, chaos furies have not been intentionally created by any of the chaos gods and do not embody any specific dark impulses beyond simple, chaotic malevolence. As such, they are blank slates easily molded to suit the whims of their more powerful masters and wide varieties of chaos furies exist with a multitude of different demonic gifts and unique powers.

### Daemon Prince

Daemon princes, known also as the Ascended, the Exalted, and the Chaos-Born, are among the most potent and feared entities in the multiverse. These dread figures tower over most mortal creatures, their forms a terrifying blend of the mortal and the infernal, an unholy testament to their fallen nature. Standing at least twice the height of a man, they are the epitome of strength and power, a monstrous fusion of bone, muscle, and dark magic.

Daemon princes were once mortal beings, individuals of such extraordinary ambition and wickedness that they caught the attention of the dark gods of the outer planes. These mortals were elevated to their current status as a reward for their exceptional service, often having led armies, toppled kingdoms, or committed atrocities beyond mortal comprehension.

Their forms vary greatly, reflecting the nature of the dark power they serve, their own inherent characteristics, and the mortal form they once possessed. Some daemon princes retain a semblance of humanoid form, albeit grotesquely warped and augmented, while others are monstrous, having multiple limbs, horns, wings, or other more bizarre features.
Daemon Princes possess immense physical strength and durability, far surpassing that of most mortal creatures. Many are also gifted with potent magical abilities that reflect their patron's nature and realm, such as tormenting the minds of their foes, spreading decay, or twisting reality. The exact nature and extent of their abilities can vary greatly from one daemon prince to another.

The path to ascension into daemonhood is fraught with danger and torment. Many who attempt it fall into madness or are consumed by the very powers they sought to master, and most followers of the dark gods simply die violent deaths before achieving the glory needed to earn the favor of their patron. However, those who succeed are granted immortality and power beyond mortal comprehension, becoming the right hand of their dark patron and a prince among daemons.

While a daemon prince is a terrifying opponent, it is also a cautionary tale, a stark reminder of the terrible price of ambition unbound and the seductive lure of ultimate power.

### Soul Grinder

Daemonic soul grinders are monstrous constructs, a terrifying fusion of daemon and machine, that exist only to harvest souls for the chaotic deities of the outer planes. These enormous entities tower over the battlefield, their forms a grotesque blend of flesh and blackened iron covered in spines, skulls, and runes of power.

Soul grinders are characterized by their enormous grinding limbs and mechanical weaponry, which they use to obliterate their foes and consume their souls. The upper bodies of these constructs often resemble the daemons that inhabit them, with a multitude of eyes, horns, and mouths, while their lower bodies are mechanical, often taking the form of a monstrous, spiked wheel or multiple-legged apparatus.

The creation of a doul grinder is a horrific process that involves binding a powerful daemon within the cold iron shell of the construct. This process often drives the daemon insane, resulting in a creature of uncontrolled rage and hunger. 
This process also involves equipping the demon with various weapons that are fused into their tortured forms. Each soul grinder comes with a different arsenal of weapons at its disposal, which dictates their preferred forms of combat. Some wield devesting blades and crushing claws, others trample their foes under their mechanical legs, and others bombard their foes from a distance with fiendish artillery.

This fate is said to befall demons who were defeated and unable to fully reform within their demonic plane. Desperate for another chance to wreak havoc, they made a bargain with fiendish smiths who forged them into new bodies. Only by repaying the smiths with a tremendous tally of souls harvested from the Material Plane can the soul grinders be fully restored to their original forms. Those who fail to do so risk becoming trapped in their mechanical forms for eternity. In a cruel form of irony, soul grinders demonstrate that even demons can be damned to a greater form of tortured existence.

## Example Custom Creatures
These creatures have been blessed by vile demons of <br> rot and pestilence, granting them putrid abilities and an unnatural sway over the forces of life and death. They <br> may worship gods of death and decay, have been <br> infected with demonic diseases, or have dabbled in <br> twisted forms of druid craft. In battle, they prioritize <br> inflicting others with their vile abilities over their own <br> well-being, for they embrace the inevitable decay of all <br> things, including themselves.

### Rot Gnoll (Gnoll)
This gnoll has succumbed to rotting demonic influences <br> that have left it putrid and filled with vile gases waiting to burst free. Rot gnolls fly into battle with the same berserk zeal as the rest of their kind, but when they die, their <br> stinking bloated bodies burst in a putrid explosion that <br> leaves behind a choking miasma.

### Pestilent Green Hag (Green Hag)
This hag has devoted herself to the cause of a demonic patron of decay, pledging to spread pestilent beauty across the land. Hags already see loveliness in what most would consider foul and ugly, so dabbling in demonic forces of decay serves as a natural complement to their twisted interests. 

Pestilent green hags are also more likely than most to form covens with other like-minded hags, as their demonic corruption fosters a perverse sense of fellowship. These covens work together to brew up the foulest plagues possible to spread to nearby settlements, an act they refer to as “charity work.” Over time, even their innate fear of death fades as they devote themselves wholly to the cause of “beautifying” the world with every disease imaginable, no matter the cost.


### The Hag’s Lair
This rotting lair is often home to a coven of pestilent hags who work to brew their latest batch of diseases to share with the world. Visitors are gleefully offered an early sampling of their latest “treats”.

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 3. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any pestilent green hag can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:

One creature of the hag’s choice within the lair she is aware of must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become infected by rampant rot disease. 

On initiative count 20 each turn, each infected creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage, then each infected creature along with every creature within 10 feet of an infected creature, must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

##### Rot Blessing

The hag becomes covered in pestilent growths, regaining hit points and becoming rot-blessed. On initiative count 20 each turn, each rot-blessed creature regains 30 hit points, and another Creature of Decay within 10 feet of it may gain the rot blessing as well. The rot blessing ends on a creature if it takes radiant or fire damage or is targeted by an effect that cures diseases.

##### Withering Disease

One creature of the hag’s choice within the lair she is aware of must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become infected by a withering disease. 

On initiative count 20 each turn, each infected creature gains one level of exhaustion, then each infected creature along with every creature within 10 feet of an infected creature, must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

> ___
> ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br>
> <br>
> At will: _chill touch, dancing lights, minor illusion_
>
> ***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.
>
> ***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.
>
> ***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:<br>
> <br>
> 1st level (4 slots): _identify, ray of sickness_<br>
> 2nd level (3 slots): _locate object, stream of corruption_<br>
> 3rd level (3 slots): _puddle of ooze, stinking cloud, vampiric touch_<br>
> 4th level (3 slots): _blight, inflict rot_<br>
> 5th level (2 slots): _contact other plane, scrying_<br>
> 6th level (1 slot): _eye bite_<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
>
> ***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.
>
> ***Wax and Wane.*** When the hag rolls initiative, it rolls d6. On an odd number, she is in the Rot state, and on an even number, she is in the Abundance state.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of her turns, the hag switches to the other state.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the Abundance state, the hag gains a +3 bonus to her armor class and saving throws.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the Rot state, the hag gains a +3 bonus to attack rolls.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observers can tell what state the hag is in by looking at her. For example, the hag may appear haggard or moldy while in the Rot state and energetic and lively while in the Abundance state.
> ### Actions
> ***Claws.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
>
> ***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

### Festering Troll (Troll)
This troll has been mutated by demonic forces of decay that have perversely granted it even greater regenerative abilities, allowing its festering wounds to scab over and renew themselves at an unnatural rate. The troll may have gained these abilities after being infected with fiendish diseases or have been “blessed” with them when it became a minion to some other force of decay (such as a coven of pestilent green hags). In combat, the troll fights with little to no regard for its own well-being as its putrid body shrugs off injury after injury, maintaining a constant state of simultaneous rot and renewal.
