# Gifted Creature Examples
This section lists examples of creatures from the Monster Manual that have been enhanced with the demonic gifts listed in this document. You can use them as they are in your games, modify them as you see fit, or use them as inspiration for creating your own custom gifted creatures. The creatures have been renamed to fit their new identities, and the flavor text for some of their abilities may be altered to fit the creature concept.

## Creatures of Rage
These creatures have been instilled with an insatiable demonic fury, making them all the more deadly in combat.

### Bugbear Warmonger (Bugbear)
These bugbears have forsaken the worship of their traditional gods in favor of a new demon lord of war and carnage who grants them heightened aggression and brutal combat powers. 

### The Bugbear’s Lair

This lair is a shrine devoted to the bugbears’ demonic patron. In typical bugbear fashion, they decorate it with grizzly trophies, with severed heads being a favorite. The rage that permeates the shrine is so strong it transcends death.

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 2. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any bugbear, disciple of rage can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:

\columnbreak

##### Blood-Curdling War Cry

A battle cry rings throughout the lair, and each non-Disciple of Rage within the lair must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until initiative count 20 on the next round. While frightened, Disciples of Rage have advantage on melee attack rolls against the creature.

A creature can choose to embrace the battle cry and make the saving throw with advantage. If it succeeds on the saving throw in this way, it goes berserk until initiative count 20 on the next round.


##### Final Fury

Rage fills the room, giving the devoted a final attack in their death throes. Each creature of the bugbear’s choice that has died since the last lair action returns to life with 1 hit point. This action can’t return a creature to life that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts, or revive a creature who has already been revived using this feature. A creature revived this way can choose to stand up immediately and is immune to all damage until the end of its next turn, after which it dies again.


##### Skull Meteor

The bugbear chooses a point on the ground within the lair, which begins to glow menacingly. On initiative count 20 of the next round, one of the room’s severed heads catches on fire and lets loose a war cry as it flies into that point and explodes. Each creature within a 10-foot radius sphere of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking damage 4 (1d8) fire damage and 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Sphinx, Defiler of Fate (Androsphinx)

No longer content to passively study the strands of fate, this sphinx has mastered the demonic arts necessary to twist destiny to its will.

### The Sphinx’s Lair

This lair is the sanctum from which the sphinx observes and twists the threads of fate. It is here where the sphinx’s power is greatest as it can twist reality to draw on greater reserves of magic and terrify its foes with nightmarish visions of different realities. 

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 5. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

##### Visions of Doom 

The sphinx creates a floating, spectral vision of futures too horrible to describe in a 10-foot cube within the layer that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn. Before it disappears, it may move up to 40 feet, and each creature it passes through or enters its space must make a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw, taking 8d10 psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature can only take this damage once per use of the lair action.



\columnbreak

A creature that uses an action to examine the visions can discern their intangible nature by succeeding on a DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation). If a creature discerns the visions for what they are, it automatically passes any saving throw against this lair action and future uses of it.

##### Tome of Power

The sphinx calls forth a floating tome of dark magic that binds to a creature of its choice. The tome follows the chosen creature wherever it goes and occupies the same space as the creature. On initiative count 20 of the next turn, a creature bound to the tome may cast a spell of 5th level or lower with a casting time of one action without expending a spell slot or daily use of the spell (no action required).

The tome is no longer bound to a creature if it dies, falls unconscious, or leaves the lair. If a creature within 5 feet of the tome uses its action to bind to the tome, it becomes bound to that creature. If the tome is already bound to a creature who does not wish to part with it, a contested Intelligence check is made, and the tome binds to the winner.

##### Arcane Surge

The sphinx calls upon magics that begin to swirl around itself out to a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area is magically empowered until the end of its next turn. While empowered this way, the next time the creature rolls damage for a spell, it can roll an additional number of d8s equal to the lair's CR and add them to the damage roll.

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**First Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.
> ### Legendary Actions
> The sphinx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sphinx regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Claw Attack.** The sphinx makes one claw attack.
>
> **Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).** The sphinx magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 120 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

### Pestilent Green Hag (Green Hag)
This hag has devoted herself to the cause of a demonic patron of decay, pledging to spread pestilent beauty across the land. She may be working with a coven of like-minded hags.

### The Hag’s Lair

This rotting lair is often home to a coven of pestilent hags who work here to brew their latest batch of diseases to share with the world. Visitors are gleefully offered an early sampling of their latest “treats”.

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 3. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any pestilent green hag can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:

##### Rampant Rot

One creature of the hag’s choice within the lair she is aware of must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become infected by rampant rot disease. 

On initiative count 20 each turn, each infected creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage, then each infected creature along with every creature within 10 feet of an infected creature, must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

##### Rot Blessing

The hag becomes covered in pestilent growths, regaining hit points and becoming rot-blessed. On initiative count 20 each turn, each rot-blessed creature regains 30 hit points, and another Disciple of Decay within 10 feet of it may gain the rot blessing as well. The rot blessing ends on a creature if it takes radiant or fire damage or is targeted by an effect that cures diseases.

##### Withering Disease

One creature of the hag’s choice within the lair she is aware of must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become infected by a withering disease. 

On initiative count 20 each turn, each infected creature gains one level of exhaustion, then each infected creature along with every creature within 10 feet of an infected creature, must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

> ___
> ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br>
> <br>
> At will: _chill touch, dancing lights, minor illusion_
>
> ***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.
>
> ***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.
>
> ***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:<br>
> <br>
> 1st level (4 slots): _identify, ray of sickness_<br>
> 2nd level (3 slots): _locate object, stream of corruption_<br>
> 3rd level (3 slots): _puddle of ooze, stinking cloud, vampiric touch_<br>
> 4th level (3 slots): _blight, inflict rot_<br>
> 5th level (2 slots): _contact other plane, scrying_<br>
> 6th level (1 slot): _eye bite_<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
>
> ***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.
>
> ***Wax and Wane.*** When the hag rolls initiative, it rolls d6. On an odd number, she is in the Rot state, and on an even number, she is in the Abundance state.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of her turns, the hag switches to the other state.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the Abundance state, the hag gains a +3 bonus to her armor class and saving throws.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the Rot state, the hag gains a +3 bonus to attack rolls.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observers can tell what state the hag is in by looking at her. For example, the hag may appear haggard or moldy while in the Rot state and energetic and lively while in the Abundance state.
> ### Actions
> ***Claws.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
>
> ***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

If the attack hits, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

### Fallen Unicorn (Unicorn)
This unicorn has fallen from grace and succumbed to pride and narcissism. It now seeks to grow a sycophantic cult of admirers who tend to its every desire.

### The Unicorn’s Lair

The unicorn’s lair is a grove of unearthly and beguiling beauty. The unicorn keeps it stocked with exquisite plants, animals, objects, and individuals who catch its fancy. Those who stumble upon the lair are rarely allowed to leave without first being broken into the unicorn’s service.

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 2. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the unicorn can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:

##### Mesmerizing Mirror

The unicorn creates a cursed mirror in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 on the next turn. When a non-Disciple of Excess creature first has line of sight of the mirror on its turn, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes mesmerized by the mirror, and all attacks have advantage against the creature while it has line of sight of the mirror, and it can't willingly move away from the mirror. Any creature that can't be charmed automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

##### Overwhelming Narcissism

The unicorn chooses a creature within the lair that it is aware of. The chosen creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with itself. While obsessed this way, the creature's speed becomes 0. It or another creature within reach of it uses an action to shake the creature out of obsession, allowing the target to make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

##### Dreadful Nightmare

The unicorn summons the image of a nightmarish version of itself in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 next turn. When a non-Disciple of Excess creature first has line of sight of the image on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it.
