# Gifts of the Demon Gods

TThis document contains a collection of creature customization options that allow you to modify monsters to reflect the effects of demonic corruption on their being. These creatures may worship demons, have been corrupted and mutated by their influence, or be creations of a specific demon lord. These new options allow you to give these creatures new abilities that reflect their demonic influence as well as guidance on modifying some of the creature’s existing attributes. 

## Demonic Themes

The types of demonic influence described in this document are split into four themes:

**Rage:** This type of demonic influence is associated with heightened aggression and increased combat abilities.

**Change:** This type of demonic influence is associated with rapid mutations, madness, and deception

**Decay:** This type of demonic influence is associated with rot, disease, and (ironically enough) unnatural regeneration.

**Excess:** This type of demonic influence is associated with speed, grace, hedonism, and emotional ensnarement.

\columnbreak

## Document Sections
Each section with customization options splits the options based on theme. At the end of the document are some “generic” demon creatures prime for customizing, followed by some examples of creatures from the Monster Manual that have been customized using the options listed in this document. 

**New Conditions:** These are new status conditions that will be used by many of the abilities listed in the document.

**Demonic Damage Types:** This is a list of damage types associated with different demonic influences you can use to modify attacks and resistances of creatures.

**Demonic Spells:** This is a suggested list of spells you can use to better match a spell caster to their demonic influence.

**Demonic Abilities:** These are new creature abilities that can reflect powerful gifts bestowed upon a creature by demonic forces.

**Demonic Lair Actions:** This is a list of lair actions you can add to creatures when they’re in an environment associated with their demonic influence.

**Demons of Chaos:** These demons with flexible origins and backgrounds that can be used as a template for customization options. 

**Example Gifted Creatures:** These are examples of stat blocks from the Monster Manual that have been modified to reflect demonic influence.

## New Conditions 
The following are new status conditions referenced throughout the rest of the document in many of the new abilities. 

Each one of these new conditions is strongly associated with one of the demonic themes: Berserk with Rage, Mutated with Change, and Obsessed with Excess. Status conditions associated with the Decay theme tend to be diseases.

#### Berserk
The berserk condition lasts for one minute by default, and berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:   <br>
 * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks.
 * The creature can't maintain concentration.
 * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.




#### Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

\columnbreak

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|



#### Obsessed
The creature becomes fixated on a specific creature or object, which is the source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see the source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for the source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see the source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless the source of its obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away from the source of its obsession.

## Demonic Damage Types

When you’re modifying a creature to fit a demonic theme, it can help to change some of the damage types they can deal with attacks or abilities to help make them more thematic. The same is true of damage resistances. 

If the creature you’re modifying deals any non-bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage types with its abilities or attacks, you can change that damage type to one associated with the creature’s demonic theme. The same is true of any damage resistances the creature has. 

The different damage types associated with the different demonic themes are listed below.

##### Damage Types of Rage
* Fire
* Thunder
* Lightning

##### Damage Types of Change
* Fire
* Force
* Lightning

##### Damage Types of Decay
* Acid
* Necrotic
* Poison

##### Damage Types of Excess
* Poison
* Psychic

## Demonic Spells

When you’re modifying a spellcasting creature to fit a demonic theme, it can help to change some of their spells to help make them more thematic. Below is a list of spells that fit the different demonic themes. You can replace any spells a creature knows with spells of the same level from its demonic theme. Note that you shouldn’t replace non-combat spells with combat spells and vice versa, as this can affect a creature’s CR.

#### Spells of Excess

***1st:***  *dissonant whispers*, *command*, *charm person*

***2nd:*** *hold person*, *mind spike*, *suggestion*

***3rd:*** *cacophonic caress**, *hypnotic pattern*, *slow*

***6th:*** *irresistible dance* , *phantasmagoria*

***8th:*** *power word: stun*

***2nd:*** *blur*, *scorching ray*, *magic aura*

***3rd:*** *fireball*, *fly*, *glean magic**

***7th:*** *fire storm*, *reverse gravity*

***8th:*** *feeblemind*

***9th:*** *chaos storm**

<br>

> ##### Where are the Spells of Rage?
> Because the creatures of the demonic rage theme eschew magic in favor of brutal combat abilities, they will generally not wield magic. If you wish to make an exception to this with your creatures, stick to simple direct damage spells that deal fire, lighting, or thunder damage. If, for some reason, you need non-combat spells, pick spells that help with mobility, such as *jump*.

## Demonic Abilities

This section lists different abilities you can add to creatures to make them more thematically aligned with a demonic theme. Each ability added to a creature increases its CR by 1. Though this isn’t an exact science, as some abilities will synergize better with some creatures than others, so use your best judgment.

A creature with an ability is considered to be a disciple of that ability’s theme, ex a creature with a demonic ability with the decay theme is a Disciple of Decay.

Some of these abilities will require a saving throw. Use the CR of the creature with the ability to determine the DC for the save, as shown below:

* CR 4 or lower - DC 13 
* CR 5 to 8 - DC 15
* CR 9 to 12 - DC 17
* CR 13 to 16 - DC 18
* CR higher - DC 19


### Gifts of Rage

Creatures with any of these abilities are Disciples of Rage.

#### Mounting Fury
*As this creature’s rage reaches its peak, it becomes all but unstoppable.*

At the start of each of the gifted creature's turns, if it has attacked a creature or taken damage since its last turn, it gains a cumulative +1 bonus to melee attack rolls, saving throws, and AC for the next minute. This bonus can stack up to 3 times.

#### Obsessive Hatred
*The creature can choose a single target to focus all its uncontrollable hate towards.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, it can choose one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The gifted creature becomes obsessed with the chosen creature, causing the gifted creature to go berserk and gain a +3 bonus to melee attack rolls against the obsessed creature.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The gifted creature cannot use this feature if it is already obsessed with a creature. The obsession lasts until the creature it is obsessed with dies or has not been seen by the gifted creature for over 1 minute.

#### Shattering Blows
*The strike of this creature can sunder the defenses of its foes.*

Once per turn, when this creature hits a target with a melee weapon attack, it can reduce the target's AC by 1 for the next minute. This ability can stack up to 5 times on a creature. Attacks from multiple creatures with this ability stack together.

#### Thirst for Battle
*There is nothing that angers this creature more than being denied combat.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, if there is no creature within reach of any of its melee weapon attacks, the gifted creature goes berserk until the end of the turn. While berserk, it gains a +3 bonus to any melee attack rolls it makes, and its movement speed is increased by 30 feet.

#### Too Angry to Die
*Grievous wounds serve only to stoke the creature's resolve.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, if it has half its hit points or fewer, it gains 20 temporary hit points.

#### Unpredictable Temper 
*The creature can randomly enter a berserk fury during combat*

At the end of each of the gifted creature's turns, it may roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, it goes berserk until the end of its next turn. While rampaging, the gifted creature gets +3 bonus to melee attack rolls and gains an additional action on each of its turns.

Once the creature goes berserk in this way, it cannot do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.

### Gifts of Change

Creatures with any of these abilities are Disciples of Change.

#### Chaos Warp
*The creature may randomly be struck by extreme change, causing it to rapidly morph into an entirely new creature.*

When granting a creature this gift, choose a creature stat block with a CR equal to this creature's CR (including the boost in CR due to this gift.)

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, if it has dealt damage to a hostile creature since its last turn, it rolls a d6. On a roll of 4 or 6, the gifted creature is incapacitated, and its speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn. At that point, it instantly transforms into the chosen creature at full health and loses this ability.


#### Mystic Acceleration

*The creature’s spells defy the laws of entropy, gaining speed the further they travel.*

When the gifted creature makes a ranged spell attack, it gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for every 20 feet between it and the target, up to a maximum of +3.

#### Mirror Double

*The creature can create an illusionary doppelganger to confound foes.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, it can create an illusory duplicate of itself as if created by the *mirror image* spell (no action required). The AC of the duplicate is equal to the gifted creature's spell save DC. The gifted creature can only have one of these duplicates at a time.

#### Nexus of Fate

*The creature's magic can twist the destinies of those it affects, swapping one fate for another.*

When the gifted creature casts a spell that forces multiple creatures to make a saving throw, it can choose two creatures that are making a saving throw against the spell. One of the chosen creatures makes the saving throw with advantage, and the other makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

#### Over-Channel
*The creature can draw massive amounts of arcane power through its spells to lay its foes low.*

When the gifted creature casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to channel greater amounts of eldritch power for as long as it concentrates on the spell. While channeling, at the start of each of the creature's turns, the spell save DC of the spell being concentrated and it's spell attack modifier are increased by 2, to a maximum of 6.

#### Twisting Flames

*Creature lets sets it's foes ablaze with corrupting fire, warping it's body.*

 Once during the gifted creature's turn, it may choose one creature that it dealt damage to make a DC Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers a mutation.

### Gifts of Decay

Creatures with any of these abilities are Disciples of Decay.

#### Bloating Corruption
*The creature's body is filled with foul gases, waiting to burst forth upon its death.*

When the gifted creature dies, it releases a cloud of toxic gas in a 10-foot radius around it that lasts for a minute. The area is treated as though it is under the effects of the *stinking cloud* spell.

#### Crumbling Pox
*The creature is teeming with lethal maladies that can be passed on to its enemies.*

Once during the gifted creature's turn, when it hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force that creature to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become infected with Crumbling Pox disease. While infected with Crumbling Pox, the creature gains one level of exhaustion at the end of each of its turns.

The disease can be cured if the creature regains 10 or more hit points or if a creature expends one use of a healer's kit on it. Alternatively, the diseased creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the disease on a success.

#### Encrusted Wounds
*The creature's wounds quickly scab over, forming a protective crust over its skin.*

When the gifted creature drops to half its hit points or fewer, it gains a +3 bonus to its AC for the next hour.

Once this ability triggers, it can’t do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.



#### Grasping Filth
*The creature oozes slime that sticks to anything it touches.*

Any land the gifted creature occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Any non-demon creature that enters the slime's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the slime. A creature can use its action to attempt to scrape or wash the sticky slime off itself or another creature, ending the effect with a successful Strength check. The freed creature can't be restrained again by the slime until the end of its next turn. Disciples of Decay ignore the effects of the slime.
 
 
#### Unnatural Renewal
*Just when the creature looks like it is slain, it falls apart into a pile of slime and mulch, only to reform in seconds.* 

If the gifted creature takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead regains all of it's hit points and falls prone, until the the same intuitive count next turn, it is paralyzed and has vulnerability to all damage types that it does not have resistance or immune to.

#### Wax and Wane
*The creature's body constantly cycles between rejuvenation and decay, changing from one second to the next.*

At the start of its turn, the creature rolls a d6. On an odd number, it is in the Rot state, and on an even number, it is in the Abundance state.

At the end of its turns, it switches to the other state.

While in the Abundance state, the creature gains a +3 bonus to its armor class and saving throws.

While in the Rot state, the creature gains a +3 bonus to attack rolls.

Observers can tell what state the creature is in by looking at it. For example, the creature may appear haggard or moldy while in the Rot state and energetic and lively while in the Abundance state.

### Gifts of Excess

Creatures with any of these abilities are Disciples of Excess.

#### Unnatural Grace

*The creature's movements are so mesmerizingly graceful that they befuddle the minds of its foes.*

 When the creature takes the Dash or Dodge action, it does not provoke opportunity attacks and can move through another creature's space as long as that creature is not immune to being charmed. If the creature ends its turn in another creature's space, it is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.


#### Complete Abandonment
*The creature forsakes all reason in its pursuit of the pleasures of bloodshed.*

 At the start of the creature's turn, if it has half its hit points or fewer, it goes berserk for one minute. While rampaging this way, any melee weapon attacks it makes that hit are critical hits, and all attacks that hit the creature are also critical hits.

Once this ability triggers, it can't do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Intoxicating Strikes
*The creature's tormenting strikes can drive others to abandon any restraint.*

Once during the creature's turn, when it hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw go berserk until the start of the creature's next turn.

#### Ego-Driven Superiority

*Arrogance gives the creature untold battle prowess for as long as it believes it is invincible.*

 The creature gets a +5 bonus to its weapon attack rolls. When an attack hits the creature or it fails a saving throw, the bonus is reduced by 1 as its ego becomes wounded. This reduction can happen up to once per turn and lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Captivating Presence

*The creature possesses an unholy allure that drives those in its presence to obsession.*

Any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of the gifted creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with it. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect automatically ends if there are no creatures with this ability within 30 feet of the obsessed creature. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the Captivating Presence of all creatures with this ability for 1 hour.

\columnbreak

#### Obsessive Stalker

*The creature is prone to single-mindedly fixating on a new plaything that it refuses to let slip out of its grasp.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, it can choose one other creature it can see within 120 feet of it to become obsessed with. While it is obsessed, it gains 30 movement speed. The target creature provokes opportunity attacks from the gifted creature even if it takes the Disengage action before leaving its reach. If the attack hits, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

If the target creature tries to teleport, it also provokes an attack of opportunity from the gifted creature, which is made with advantage. If the attack hits, the gifted creature may choose to teleport along with the target creature to the nearest unoccupied space next to it where it appears.

The obsession lasts until the creature it is obsessed with dies or has not been seen by the gifted creature for over 1 minute.

The gifted creature cannot use this feature if it already has an obsession with a creature.

## Lair Actions of Chaos

This section lists different lair actions you can give gifted creatures access to when they’re fighting at a location under the influence of their demonic patron.

These may be locations haunted by a demonic presence, such as a shrine devoted to a demon lord or a battlefield of interest to a particularly dark power. Those aligned with the dark influences of these locations can draw on their power to lay their enemies low.
You can give one or more creatures the ability to access two or more lair actions listed in this section that all belong to the same theme. Only one creature can take a lair action per round. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any creature with lair actions can take one lair action.

When you add lair actions to an encounter, you can treat the lair as an additional creature being added for the purposes of determining how it increases the encounter’s challenge rating. The equivalent CR of the lair depends on the average level of the players, as shown in the table below. If a lair action requires a saving throw, the DC of the save is determined by the equivalent CR of the lair. 

##### Lair Challenge Ratings (CRs)
| Party Level Range  | Equivalent CR | Effect Save DC |  
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1-4  | 1 | 13 |
|  5-8  | 2 | 15 |
|  9-12 | 3 |  17 |
|  13-16| 4 |   18 |
| 17-20 | 5 |  19 |

### Lair Actions of Rage

Any Creature that can use these lair actions is a Disciple of Rage.

#### Axe of Wrath (NOTE: Why no scaling damage?)

A brass axe slices through reality at a point within the lair of the gifted creature's choice and flies in a straight line 100 feet in a direction the gifted creature chooses before disappearing, disappearing early if it impacts a solid surface. If the weapon would strike a creature, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the axe strikes the target and stops moving. 

When the weapon strikes something, it deals slashing damage based on the roll of a d20:

* 4 or lower - 2d8 slashing damage.
* 5 to 8 - 4d8 slashing damage.
* 9 to 12 - 3d8 slashing damage.
* 13 to 16 - 4d8 slashing damage.
* 17 higher - 5d8 slashing damage.



#### Blood-Curdling War Cry

A battle cry rings throughout the lair, and each non-Disciple of Rage within the lair must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until initiative count 20 on the next round. While frightened, Disciples of Rage have advantage on melee attack rolls against the creature.

A creature can choose to embrace the battle cry and make the saving throw with advantage. If it succeeds on the saving throw in this way, it goes berserk until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Crimson Rain

The gifted creature calls forth a downpour of bloody rain that invigorates each Disciple of Rage within a 20-foot-radius, 80-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within the lair. Each affected creature gains temporary hit points based on the lair's CR:

* **CR 1:** 2d4 temporary hit points
* **CR 2:** 4d4 temporary hit points
* **CR 3:** 6d4 temporary hit points
* **CR 4:** 8d4 temporary hit points
* **CR 5:** 10d4 temporary hit points

#### Final Fury

Rage fills the room, giving the devoted a final attack in their death throes. Each creature of the gifted creature’s choice that has died since the last lair action returns to life with 1 hit point. This action can’t return a creature to life that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts, or revive a creature who has already been revived using this feature. A creature revived this way can choose to stand up immediately and is immune to all damage until the end of its next turn, after which it dies again.

#### Hex Bane

A burning hatred of the magical arts fills the lair, boiling the blood of any creature that attempts to cast a spell. Until initiative count 20 of the next round, any creature that tries to cast a spell within the lair feels their blood start to burn. The creature can choose another action, but if its tries to cast the spell, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted. 

#### Skull Meteor

The gifted creature chooses a point on the ground within the lair, and a burning skull forms in the sky above. On initiative count 20 of the next round, the skull comes crashing down at the point. Each creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The amount of damage and radius of the area affected depends on the lair's CR:

* **CR 1:** 10-foot radius sphere, dealing 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 bludgeoning damage
* **CR 2:** 10-foot radius sphere, dealing 2d8 fire damage and 2d8 bludgeoning damage
* **CR 3:** 15-foot radius sphere, dealing 3d8 fire damage and 3d8 bludgeoning damage
* **CR 4:** 15-foot radius sphere, dealing 4d8 fire damage and 4d8 bludgeoning damage
* **CR 5:** 20-foot radius sphere, dealing 5d8 fire damage and 5d8 bludgeoning damage

### Lair Actions of Change

Any Creature that can use these lair actions is a Disciple of Change.

#### Demonic Mirage 

The gifted creature creates a floating, spectral demonic image in a 10-foot cube within the layer that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn. Before it disappears, it may move up to 40 feet, and each creature it passes through or enters its space must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature can only take this damage once per use of the lair action.

A creature that uses an action to examine the demonic image can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, it automatically passes any saving throw against this lair action and future uses of it.

The amount of psychic damage depends on the result of the Intelligence saving throw: **NOTE: should the damage scale with lair CR?**
* 4 or lower: 2d8 psychic damage
* 5 to 8: 4d8 psychic damage
* 9 to 12: 6d8 psychic damage
* 13 to 16: 8d8 psychic damage
* 17 or higher: 8d10 psychic damage.


#### Living Flames

The gifted creature creates a storm of pink and blue flames in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within the lair that lasts until this lair action is used again, and the creature chooses a direction for it. When the storm appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. 

The flames move 20 feet in the chosen direction on initiative count 20 of each turn after it has been summoned.

The fire damage dealt is based on the lair's CR:

* **CR 1:** - 1d8 fire damage.
* **CR 2:** - 2d8 fire damage.
* **CR 3:** - 3d8 fire damage.
* **CR 4:** - 4d8 fire damage.
* **CR 5:** - 5d8 fire damage.


#### Bolt of Mutation

A bolt of mutating energy flashes down on a non-demon creature of the gifted creature’s choice within the lair that the it is aware of. The targeted creature and each non-demon creature within 5 feet of it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers a mutation. If only one creature makes the saving throw this way, it has disadvantage, as all the energy is focused on it. If three or more creatures make the saving throw, they make their saving throws with advantage.

\columnbreak

#### Sigil of Change

The user causes a sigil of warping energy to appear in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn. The sigil has malevolent intelligence (Intelligence equal to that of the gifted creature) and has true sight out to 30 feet. When the sigil appears and when it disappears, it can force a creature within 30 feet of it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation.

#### Arcane Surge

The gifted creature calls upon magics that begin to swirl around itself out to a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area is magically empowered until the end of its next turn. While empowered this way, the next time the creature rolls damage for a spell, it can roll an additional number of d8s equal to the lair's CR and add them to the damage roll:


#### Tome of Power

The gifted creature calls forth a floating tome of dark magic that binds to a creature of its choice. The tome follows the chosen creature wherever it goes and occupies the same space as the creature. On initiative count 20 of the next turn, a creature bound to the tome may cast a spell with a casting time of one action without expending a spell slot or daily use of the spell (no action required). The maximum spell level of this spell is determined by the CR of the gifted creature. Regardless of whether the spell is cast, the tome disappears at this point.

The tome is no longer bound to a creature if it dies, falls unconscious, or leaves the lair. If a creature within 5 feet of the tome uses its action to bind to the tome, it becomes bound to that creature. If the tome is already bound to a creature who does not wish to part with it, a contested Intelligence check is made, and the tome binds to the winner.

The maximum spell level of the spell cast by the tome is equal to the lair's CR.

### Lair Actions of Decay

Any Creature that can use these lair actions is a Disciple of Decay.

#### Bubo Bomb

A willing creature is covered in boils filled with rancid acid.

* **CR 3:** - 6d6 acid damage
* **CR 4:** - 8d6 acid damage

Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

The necrotic damage dealt by the disease is dependent on the lair's CR, as shown below:

* **CR 1:** - 1d8 necrotic damage
* **CR 2:** - 2d8 necrotic damage
* **CR 3:** - 3d8 necrotic damage
* **CR 4:** - 4d8 necrotic damage
* **CR 5:** - 5d8 necrotic damage

\columnbreak

#### Rot Blessing

The gifted creature becomes covered in pestilent growths, regaining hit points and becoming rot blessed. On initiative count 20 each turn, each rot blessed creature regains hit points equal to 10 times the lair's CR, and another Disciple of Decay within 15 feet of it may gain the rot blessing as well. The rot blessing ends on a creature if it takes radiant or fire damage or is targeted by an effect that cures diseases.


#### Tree of Decay

The gifted creature selects an unoccupied 10-foot cube on the ground within the lair and causes a corrupted tree to grow there and fill up the space. The tree has an AC of 14, hit points determined by the CR of the gifted creature, and is immune to poison and necrotic damage. It releases an aura of corruption in a 10-foot radius, halving the speed of any non-Disciple of Decay creature in the area. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage determined by the CR of the gifted creature. On a pass, the creature takes half as much damage. 

The tree’s hit points and necrotic damage based on the lair's CR as shown below:

# Demons of Chaos

The following demons aren’t aligned with a specific demonic theme but can be used as a baseline for adding gifts and other customizations to make them a part of a particular type of demonic force. They are often shaped by other fiendish influences which specialize them for service to their given demon patron. Otherwise, they can serve as “neutral” demons without a specific master or theme. 



## Chaos Fury

These wicked, winged demons personify the unpredictable and volatile nature of chaos. They stand roughly three to four feet tall, with lean, muscular bodies that can take on various appearances depending on the influence of the demons they serve. Their wide, leathery wings grant them impressive speed and agility in flight, while their long, sharp claws allow them to easily slice through vulnerable flesh. 

Chaos furies are believed to be lesser demons, birthed from the raw energies of the realm of chaos. Their malleable and subservient nature means they are often used as agents of chaos by more powerful demons, sowing discord and confusion before a larger demonic incursion. Despite their small size and seemingly low threat level, these creatures' unpredictable and opportunistic nature allows them to wreak havoc on larger enemies. Chaos furies are cowardly by nature and will wait until they see vulnerable or isolated foes before striking at lightning speed, using hit-and-run attacks to prevent their prey from mounting an effective counterattack.

Unlike many other demons, chaos furies have not been intentionally created by any of the chaos gods and do not embody any specific dark impulses beyond simple, chaotic malevolence. As such, they are blank slates easily molded to suit the whims of their more powerful masters and wide varieties of chaos furies exist with a multitude of different demonic gifts and unique powers.

## Daemon Prince

Daemon princes, known also as the Ascended, the Exalted, and the Chaos-Born, are among the most potent and feared entities in the multiverse. These dread figures tower over most mortal creatures, their forms a terrifying blend of the mortal and the infernal, an unholy testament to their fallen nature. Standing at least twice the height of a man, they are the epitome of strength and power, a monstrous fusion of bone, muscle, and dark magic.

Daemon princes were once mortal beings, individuals of such extraordinary ambition and wickedness that they caught the attention of the dark gods of the outer planes. These mortals were elevated to their current status as a reward for their exceptional service, often having led armies, toppled kingdoms, or committed atrocities beyond mortal comprehension.

Their forms vary greatly, reflecting the nature of the dark power they serve, their own inherent characteristics, and the mortal form they once possessed. Some daemon princes retain a semblance of humanoid form, albeit grotesquely warped and augmented, while others are monstrous, having multiple limbs, horns, wings, or other more bizarre features.
Daemon Princes possess immense physical strength and durability, far surpassing that of most mortal creatures. Many are also gifted with potent magical abilities that reflect their patron's nature and realm, such as tormenting the minds of their foes, spreading decay, or twisting reality. The exact nature and extent of their abilities can vary greatly from one daemon prince to another.

The path to ascension into daemonhood is fraught with danger and torment. Many who attempt it fall into madness or are consumed by the very powers they sought to master, and most followers of the dark gods simply die violent deaths before achieving the glory needed to earn the favor of their patron. However, those who succeed are granted immortality and power beyond mortal comprehension, becoming the right hand of their dark patron and a prince among daemons.

While a daemon prince is a terrifying opponent, it is also a cautionary tale, a stark reminder of the terrible price of ambition unbound and the seductive lure of ultimate power.

## Soul Grinder

Daemonic soul grinders are monstrous constructs, a terrifying fusion of daemon and machine, that exist only to harvest souls for the chaotic deities of the outer planes. These enormous entities tower over the battlefield, their forms a grotesque blend of flesh and blackened iron covered in spines, skulls, and runes of power.

Soul grinders are characterized by their enormous grinding limbs and mechanical weaponry, which they use to obliterate their foes and consume their souls. The upper bodies of these constructs often resemble the daemons that inhabit them, with a multitude of eyes, horns, and mouths, while their lower bodies are mechanical, often taking the form of a monstrous, spiked wheel or multiple-legged apparatus.

The creation of a doul grinder is a horrific process that involves binding a powerful daemon within the cold iron shell of the construct. This process often drives the daemon insane, resulting in a creature of uncontrolled rage and hunger. 
This process also involves equipping the demon with various weapons that are fused into their tortured forms. Each soul grinder comes with a different arsenal of weapons at its disposal, which dictates their preferred forms of combat. Some wield devesting blades and crushing claws, others trample their foes under their mechanical legs, and others bombard their foes from a distance with fiendish artillery.

This fate is said to befall demons who were defeated and unable to fully reform within their demonic plane. Desperate for another chance to wreak havoc, they made a bargain with fiendish smiths who forged them into new bodies. Only by repaying the smiths with a tremendous tally of souls harvested from the Material Plane can the soul grinders be fully restored to their original forms. Those who fail to do so risk becoming trapped in their mechanical forms for eternity. In a cruel form of irony, soul grinders demonstrate that even demons can be damned to a greater form of tortured existence.

### The Plaguefather's Lair

The Plaguefather’s home serves as a garden to grow choice ingredients and a laboratory to host his twisted experiments. It is filled with living things laden with rot and forever on the brink of death. This lair is normally on his demonic home plane, but he may establish a lair in a location on the Material Plane where he wishes to conduct extended experiments. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the plaguefather can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

#### Blood-Curdling War Cry

A battle cry rings throughout the lair, and each non-Disciple of Rage within the lair must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until initiative count 20 on the next round. While frightened, Disciples of Rage have advantage on melee attack rolls against the creature.

A creature can choose to embrace the battle cry and make the saving throw with advantage. If it succeeds on the saving throw in this way, it goes berserk until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Final Fury

Rage fills the room, giving the devoted a final attack in their death throes. Each creature of the gifted creature’s choice that has died since the last lair action returns to life with 1 hit point. This action can’t return a creature to life that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts, or revive a creature who has already been revived using this feature. A creature revived this way can choose to stand up immediately and is immune to all damage until the end of its next turn, after which it dies again.

#### Skull Meteor

The gifted creature chooses a point on the ground within the lair, and a burning skull forms in the sky above. On initiative count 20 of the next round, the skull comes crashing down at the point. Each creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The amount of damage and radius of the area affected depends on the creature's CR:

* 4 or lower: 10-foot radius sphere, dealing 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 bludgeoning damage
