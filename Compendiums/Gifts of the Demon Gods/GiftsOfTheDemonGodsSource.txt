# Gifts of the Demon Gods

TThis document contains a collection of creature customization options that allow you to modify monsters to reflect the effects of demonic corruption on their being. These creatures may worship demons, have been corrupted and mutated by their influence, or be creations of a specific demon lord. These new options allow you to give these creatures new abilities that reflect their demonic influence as well as guidance on modifying some of the creature’s existing attributes. 

## Demonic Themes

The types of demonic influence described in this document are split into four themes:

**Rage:** This type of demonic influence is associated with heightened aggression and increased combat abilities.

**Change:** This type of demonic influence is associated with rapid mutations, arcane manipulation, madness, and deception.

**Decay:** This type of demonic influence is associated with rot, disease, and (ironically enough) unnatural regeneration.

**Excess:** This type of demonic influence is associated with speed, grace, hedonism, and emotional ensnarement.

\columnbreak

## Document Sections
Each section with customization options splits the options based on theme. At the end of the document are some “generic” demon creatures prime for customizing, followed by examples of creatures from the Monster Manual that have been customized using these options. 

**New Conditions:** New status conditions that will be used by many of the abilities listed in the document.

**Demonic Damage Types:** A list of damage types associated with different demonic influences you can use to modify attacks and resistances of creatures.

**Demonic Spells:** A suggested list of spells you can use to better match a spell caster to their demonic influence plus new spells.

**Demonic Abilities:** New creature abilities that can reflect powerful gifts bestowed upon a creature by demonic forces.

**Demonic Lair Actions:** Lair actions you can add to creatures when they’re in an environment associated with their demonic influence.

**Demons of Chaos:** Demons with flexible origins and backgrounds that can be used as a template for customization options. 

**Example Gifted Creatures:** Examples of stat blocks from the Monster Manual that have been modified to reflect demonic influences.

\pagebreakNum

## New Conditions 
The following are new status conditions referenced throughout the rest of the document in many of the new abilities. 

Each one of these new conditions is strongly associated with one of the demonic themes: Berserk with Rage, Mutated with Change, and Obsessed with Excess. Status conditions associated with the Decay theme tend to be diseases which will all have unique symptoms.

#### Berserk
Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:   <br>
 * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can't maintain concentration.
 * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.




#### Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

\columnbreak

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|



#### Obsessed 
The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

## Demonic Damage Types

When you’re modifying a creature to fit a demonic theme, it can help to change some of the damage types they can deal with attacks or abilities to help make them more thematic. The same is true of damage resistances. 

If the creature you’re modifying deals any non-bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage types with its abilities or attacks, you can change that damage type to one associated with the creature’s demonic theme. The same is true of any damage resistances the creature has. 

The different damage types associated with the different demonic themes are listed below.

##### Damage Types of Rage
* Fire
* Thunder
* Lightning

##### Damage Types of Change
* Fire
* Force
* Lightning

##### Damage Types of Decay
* Acid
* Necrotic
* Poison

##### Damage Types of Excess
* Poison
* Psychic

**Found in *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*<br>
***Found in *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*<br>

> ##### Where are the Spells of Rage?
> Creatures of the demonic rage theme eschew magic in favor of brutal combat abilities and will generally not wield magic. If you wish to make an exception to this, stick to simple direct damage spells that deal fire, lighting, or thunder damage and mobility enhancing spells, such as *jump*.

### New Spells of Change
Spellcasters wielding magic of change favor spells of transformation, trickery, and chaos. While many existing D&D spells can represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this unpredictable style of sorcery into your campaigns.

#### Bolt of Change
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (a caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation.  The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending all mutations caused by this spell it on a success. 

A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Chaos Storm
*9th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of demon ichor)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
You open a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction.  A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered on a point within range that lasts for the spell's duration.  This sphere is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away.  No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting a point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration without your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.


#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

### New Spells of Decay
Spellcasters wielding magic of decay favor <br> spells that inflict rot, disease, and entropy. <br> While many existing D&D spells can represent <br> this magic, the following new spells provide even <br> more ways of bringing this putrescent style of <br> sorcery into your campaigns.



#### Miasma of Pestilence 
*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V S M (A bit of durian fruit)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A cloud of putrescent vapor appears in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a moderate wind (at least 5 miles per hour) disperses it after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Each creature completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.

#### Puddle of Ooze
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of slug slime)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid, Sorcerer 
___

You cover the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range with acidic ooze, causing it to become difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 1d4 acid damage for every 5 feet it travels.

When the ooze appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage.

#### Rancid Visitation
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Cleric, Warlock
___

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, it takes 4d10 necrotic damage and is afflicted with a disease that lasts until the spell ends.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A creature afflicted by this disease takes 4d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of your turns and must then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. 

If a diseased creature drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can end the disease on the creature and cause it to infect a new creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it. The new creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be infected with the same disease for the remainder of the spell's duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, each time it would deal damage, it deals an additional 1d10 necrotic damage for each slot level above 4th.


#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the necrotic damage dealt to targeted creatures and creatures in the area of the cone of bile by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

### New Spells of Excess
Spellcasters wielding magic of excess favor spells that  induce indulgence, pain, pleasure, some perverse combination of all three. While many existing D&D spells can represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this profane style of sorcery into your campaigns.


#### Cacophonic Caress
*3rd-level  evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You throw back your head and emit an ululating scream.  Each creature within range takes 4d4 thunder damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d4 additional psychic damage and be deafened for 1 minute.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much psychic damage and isn't deafened.  A creature deafened this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the thunder and psychic damage increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Phantasmagoria
*6th-level illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Warlock
___

You summon illusory creatures who flit and broil within a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point within range you can see.  The creatures whisper dark promises of fulfillment, seducing and bewildering hapless foes.  You can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the spell.  An affected creature in the area of the spell suffers disadvantage on Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws and checks to maintain concentration.  The spell ends if you move more than 60 feet away from the area under its effect.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Slicing Shards
*4th-level  conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of broken glass)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a cloud of razor-sharp glass capable of slicing through mind and body and send it flying toward a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 10d4 slashing damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw.  The target takes 10d4 additional psychic damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one.  If the attack misses, the glass grazes the target, and it takes half as much of the initial slashing damage and does not make the Wisdom saving throw or take any additional psychic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, both the slashing and psychic damage increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.

## Demonic Abilities

This section lists different abilities you can add to creatures to make them more thematically aligned with a demonic theme. Each ability added to a creature increases its CR by 1. Though this isn’t an exact science, as different abilities will synergize better with some creatures than others, so use your best judgment.

A creature with a demonic ability is considered to be a creature of that ability’s theme, ex a creature with a demonic ability from the decay theme is a Creature of Decay.

Some of these abilities will require a saving throw. Use the CR of the creature with the ability to determine the DC for the save, as shown below:

* CR 4 or lower - DC 13 
* CR 5 to 8 - DC 15
* CR 9 to 12 - DC 17
* CR 13 to 16 - DC 18
* CR 17+ - DC 19


### Gifts of Rage

Creatures with any of these abilities are Creatures of Rage.

Creatures with any of these abilities are Creatures of Change.

#### Chaos Warp
*The creature may randomly be struck by extreme change, causing it to rapidly morph into an entirely new creature.*

When granting a creature this gift, choose a creature stat block with a CR equal to this creature's CR (including the boost in CR due to this gift.)

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, if it has dealt damage to a hostile creature since its last turn, it rolls a d6. On a roll of 4 or 6, the gifted creature is incapacitated, and its speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn. At that point, it instantly transforms into the chosen creature at full health and loses this ability.


#### Mystic Acceleration

*The creature’s spells defy the laws of entropy, gaining speed the further they travel.*

When the gifted creature makes a ranged spell attack, it gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for every 20 feet between it and the target, up to a maximum of +3.

#### Mirror Double

*The creature can create an illusionary doppelganger to confound foes.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, it can create an illusory duplicate of itself as if created by the *mirror image* spell (no action required). The AC of the duplicate is equal to the gifted creature's gift save DC. The gifted creature can only have one of these duplicates at a time.

#### Nexus of Fate

*The creature's magic can twist the destinies of those it affects, swapping one fate for another.*

When the gifted creature casts a spell that forces multiple creatures to make a saving throw, it can choose two creatures that are making a saving throw against the spell. One of the chosen creatures makes the saving throw with advantage, and the other makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

#### Over-Channel
*The creature can draw massive amounts of arcane power through its spells to lay its foes low.*

When the gifted creature casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to channel greater amounts of eldritch power for as long as it concentrates on the spell. While channeling, at the start of each of the creature's turns, the spell save DC of the spell being concentrated and it's spell attack modifier are increased by 2, to a maximum of 6.

### Gifts of Decay

Creatures with any of these abilities are Creatures of Decay.

#### Bloating Corruption
*The creature's body is filled with foul gases, waiting to burst forth upon its death.*

When the gifted creature dies, it releases a cloud of toxic gas in a 10-foot radius around it that lasts for a minute. The area is treated as though it is under the effects of the *stinking cloud* spell.

#### Crumbling Pox
*The creature is teeming with lethal maladies that can be passed on to its enemies.*

Once during the gifted creature's turn, when it hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force that creature to succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become infected with Crumbling Pox disease. While infected with Crumbling Pox, the creature gains one level of exhaustion at the end of each of its turns.

The disease can be cured if the creature regains 10 or more hit points or if a creature expends one use of a healer's kit on it. Alternatively, the diseased creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the disease on a success.

#### Encrusted Wounds
*The creature's wounds quickly scab over, forming a protective crust over its skin.*

When the gifted creature drops to half its hit points or fewer, it gains a +3 bonus to its AC for the next hour.

Once this ability triggers, it can’t do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Grasping Filth
*The creature oozes slime that sticks to anything it touches.*

Any land the gifted creature occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Any non-demon creature that enters the slime's area or starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the slime. A creature can use its action to attempt to scrape or wash the sticky slime off itself or another creature, ending the effect with a successful Strength check. The freed creature can't be restrained again by the slime until the end of its next turn. Creatures of Decay ignore the effects of the slime.
 
 
#### Unnatural Renewal
*Just when the creature looks like it is slain, it falls apart into a pile of slime and mulch, only to reform in seconds.* 

If the gifted creature takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead regains all of it's hit points and falls prone, until the same intuitive count next turn, it is paralyzed and has vulnerability to all damage types that it does not have resistance or immune to. 
 
Once this ability triggers, it can’t do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

At the end of its turns, it switches to the other state.

While in the Abundance state, the creature gains a +3 bonus to its armor class and saving throws.

While in the Rot state, the creature gains a +3 bonus to attack rolls.

Observers can tell what state the creature is in by looking at it. For example, the creature may appear haggard or moldy while in the Rot state and energetic and lively while in the Abundance state.

### Gifts of Excess

Creatures with any of these abilities are Creatures of Excess.

#### Unnatural Grace

*The creature's movements are so mesmerizingly graceful that they befuddle the minds of its foes.*

 When the creature takes the Dash or Dodge action, it does not provoke opportunity attacks and can move through another creature's space as long as that creature is not immune to being charmed. If the creature ends its turn in another creature's space, it is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.


#### Complete Abandonment
*The creature forsakes all reason in its pursuit of the pleasures of bloodshed.*

 At the start of the creature's turn, if it has half its hit points or fewer, it goes berserk for one minute. While berserk this way, any melee weapon attacks it makes that hit are critical hits, and all attacks that hit the creature are also critical hits.

Once this ability triggers, it can't do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Intoxicating Strikes
*The creature's tormenting strikes can drive others to abandon any restraint.*

Once during the creature's turn, when it hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw go berserk until the start of the creature's next turn.

#### Ego-Driven Superiority

*Arrogance gives the creature untold battle prowess for as long as it believes it is invincible.*

 The creature gets a +5 bonus to its weapon attack rolls. When an attack hits the creature or it fails a saving throw, the bonus is reduced by 1 as its ego becomes wounded. This reduction can happen up to once per turn and lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Captivating Presence

*The creature possesses an unholy allure that drives those in its presence to obsession.*

Any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of the gifted creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with it. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect automatically ends if there are no creatures with this ability within 30 feet of the obsessed creature. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the Captivating Presence of all creatures with this ability for 1 hour.

#### Obsessive Stalker

*The creature is prone to single-mindedly fixating on a new plaything that it refuses to let slip out of its grasp.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, it can choose one other creature it can see within 120 feet of it to become obsessed with. While it is obsessed, its movement speed increases by 30 feet.

 All attacks of opportunity by the gifted creature against the target creature are made with advantage, and the target creature provokes opportunity attacks from the gifted creature even if it takes the Disengage action before leaving its reach. If the attack hits, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

If the target creature tries to teleport, it also provokes an attack of opportunity from the gifted creature. If the attack hits, the gifted creature may choose to teleport along with the target creature to the nearest unoccupied space next to it where it appears.

The obsession lasts until the creature it is obsessed with dies or has not been seen by the gifted creature for over 1 minute.

The gifted creature cannot use this feature if it is already obsessed with a creature.

## Lair Actions of Chaos

This section lists different lair actions you can give gifted creatures access to when they’re fighting at a location under the influence of their demonic patron.

These may be locations haunted by a demonic presence, such as a shrine devoted to a demon lord or a battlefield of interest to a particularly dark power. Those aligned with the dark influences of these locations can draw on their power to lay their enemies low.

You can give one or more creatures the ability to access two or more lair actions listed in this section that all belong to the same theme. Only one creature can take a lair action per round. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any creature with lair actions can take one lair action.

When you add lair actions to an encounter, you can treat the lair as an additional creature being added for the purposes of determining how it increases the encounter’s challenge rating. The equivalent CR of the lair depends on the average level of the players, as shown in the table below. If a lair action requires a saving throw, the DC of the save is determined by the equivalent CR of the lair. 

##### Lair Challenge Ratings (CRs)
| Party Level Range  | Lair CR | Lair Save DC |  
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1-4  | 1 | 13 |
|  5-8  | 2 | 15 |
|  9-12 | 3 |  17 |
|  13-16| 4 |   18 |
| 17-20 | 5 |  19 |

If only one creature makes the saving throw this way, it has disadvantage, as all the energy is focused on it. If three or more creatures make the saving throw, they make their saving throws with advantage.


#### Demonic Mirage 

The gifted creature creates a floating, spectral demonic image in a 10-foot cube within the layer that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn.

A creature can only take this damage once per use of the lair action.

A creature that uses an action to examine the demonic image can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the save DC.

The flames move 20 feet in the chosen direction on initiative count 20 of each turn after it has been summoned.

* **CR 4:** - 4d8 fire damage.
* **CR 5:** - 5d8 fire damage.




#### Sigil of Change

The user causes a sigil of warping energy to appear in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn.

When the sigil appears and when it disappears, it can force a creature within 30 feet of it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation.


#### Tome of Power

The gifted creature calls forth a floating tome of dark magic that binds to a creature of its choice. The tome follows the chosen creature wherever it goes and occupies the same space as the creature. On initiative count 20 of the next turn, a creature bound to the tome may cast a spell with a casting time of one action without expending a spell slot or daily use of the spell (no action required). The maximum spell level of this spell is determined by the CR of the gifted creature. Regardless of whether the spell is cast, the tome disappears at this point.

The tome is no longer bound to a creature if it dies, falls unconscious, or leaves the lair. If a creature within 5 feet of the tome uses its action to bind to the tome, it becomes bound to that creature. If the tome is already bound to a creature who does not wish to part with it, a contested Intelligence check is made, and the tome binds to the winner.

The maximum spell level of the spell cast by the tome is equal to the lair's CR.

### Lair Actions of Excess

Any creature that can use these lair actions is a Creature of Excess.

#### Dreadful Visage

The gifted creature summons the image of a horrifying demonic face in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 next turn. When a non-Creature of Excess creature first has line of sight of the image on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it.

#### Excruciating Blades

The gifted creature summons a swarm of jagged, spinning blades in a 10-foot cube within the lair. On initiative count 20 of the next turn, the cube moves 100 feet in a straight line toward the nearest non-Creature of Excess creature in the lair. Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn, starts its turn there, or is hit by the blades while it is moving, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes an amount of slashing damage determined by the lair's CR, and on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage:

* **CR 1:** 1d6 slashing damage
* **CR 2:** 2d6 slashing damage
* **CR 3:** 3d6 slashing damage
* **CR 4:** 4d6 slashing damage
* **CR 5:** 5d6 slashing damage

 
#### Mesmerizing Mirror

The gifted creature creates a cursed mirror in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 on the next turn. When a non-Creature of Excess creature first has line of sight of the mirror on its turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes mesmerized by the mirror, and all attacks have advantage against the creature while it has line of sight of the mirror, and it can't willingly move away from the mirror. Any creature that can't be charmed automatically succeeds on this saving throw.


#### Overwhelming Narcissism

The gifted creature chooses a creature within the lair that it is aware of. The chosen creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with itself. While <br> obsessed this way, the creature's speed becomes 0. It or another creature within reach of it uses an action to shake the creature out of obsession, allowing the target to make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect <br> ends.

\columnbreak

#### Sweet Sorrow

A creature within the lair that the gifted creature is aware of must make a Wisdom saving throw or release a scent of sorrow that other Creatures of Excess cannot resist. If the creature fails, each Creature of Excess within the lair may use its reaction to move up to its speed towards it without provoking attacks of opportunity and become obsessed with the creature until initiative count 20 on the next turn. While obsessed with the creature, they know its exact location within the lair, and whenever they hit the creature with a melee weapon attack, they regain hit points equal to half the amount of damage dealt.

#### Wave of Depravity
 
Dark whispers echo through the lair, encouraging creatures to unleash their inner desires. Each non-Creature of Excess creature within the lair that can hear the whispers must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature goes berserk until the end of its next turn.

# Demons of Chaos

The following demons aren’t aligned with a specific demonic theme but can be used as a baseline for adding gifts and other customizations to make them a part of a particular type of demonic force. They are often shaped by other fiendish influences which specialize them for service to their given demon patron. Otherwise, they can serve as “neutral” demons without a specific master or theme. 



## Chaos Fury

These wicked, winged demons personify the unpredictable and volatile nature of chaos. They stand roughly three to four feet tall, with lean, muscular bodies that can take on various appearances depending on the influence of the demons they serve. Their wide, leathery wings grant them impressive speed and agility in flight, while their long, sharp claws allow them to easily slice through vulnerable flesh. 

Chaos furies are believed to be lesser demons, birthed from the raw energies of the realm of chaos. Their malleable and subservient nature means they are often used as agents of chaos by more powerful demons, sowing discord and confusion before a larger demonic incursion. Despite their small size and seemingly low threat level, these creatures' unpredictable and opportunistic nature allows them to wreak havoc on larger enemies. Chaos furies are cowardly by nature and will wait until they see vulnerable or isolated foes before striking at lightning speed, using hit-and-run attacks to prevent their prey from mounting an effective counterattack.

Unlike many other demons, chaos furies have not been intentionally created by any of the chaos gods and do not embody any specific dark impulses beyond simple, chaotic malevolence. As such, they are blank slates easily molded to suit the whims of their more powerful masters and wide varieties of chaos furies exist with a multitude of different demonic gifts and unique powers.

## Daemon Prince

Daemon princes, known also as the Ascended, the Exalted, and the Chaos-Born, are among the most potent and feared entities in the multiverse. These dread figures tower over most mortal creatures, their forms a terrifying blend of the mortal and the infernal, an unholy testament to their fallen nature. Standing at least twice the height of a man, they are the epitome of strength and power, a monstrous fusion of bone, muscle, and dark magic.

Daemon princes were once mortal beings, individuals of such extraordinary ambition and wickedness that they caught the attention of the dark gods of the outer planes. These mortals were elevated to their current status as a reward for their exceptional service, often having led armies, toppled kingdoms, or committed atrocities beyond mortal comprehension.

Their forms vary greatly, reflecting the nature of the dark power they serve, their own inherent characteristics, and the mortal form they once possessed. Some daemon princes retain a semblance of humanoid form, albeit grotesquely warped and augmented, while others are monstrous, having multiple limbs, horns, wings, or other more bizarre features.
Daemon Princes possess immense physical strength and durability, far surpassing that of most mortal creatures. Many are also gifted with potent magical abilities that reflect their patron's nature and realm, such as tormenting the minds of their foes, spreading decay, or twisting reality. The exact nature and extent of their abilities can vary greatly from one daemon prince to another.

The path to ascension into daemonhood is fraught with danger and torment. Many who attempt it fall into madness or are consumed by the very powers they sought to master, and most followers of the dark gods simply die violent deaths before achieving the glory needed to earn the favor of their patron. However, those who succeed are granted immortality and power beyond mortal comprehension, becoming the right hand of their dark patron and a prince among daemons.

While a daemon prince is a terrifying opponent, it is also a cautionary tale, a stark reminder of the terrible price of ambition unbound and the seductive lure of ultimate power.

## Soul Grinder

Daemonic soul grinders are monstrous constructs, a terrifying fusion of daemon and machine, that exist only to harvest souls for the chaotic deities of the outer planes. These enormous entities tower over the battlefield, their forms a grotesque blend of flesh and blackened iron covered in spines, skulls, and runes of power.

Soul grinders are characterized by their enormous grinding limbs and mechanical weaponry, which they use to obliterate their foes and consume their souls. The upper bodies of these constructs often resemble the daemons that inhabit them, with a multitude of eyes, horns, and mouths, while their lower bodies are mechanical, often taking the form of a monstrous, spiked wheel or multiple-legged apparatus.

The creation of a doul grinder is a horrific process that involves binding a powerful daemon within the cold iron shell of the construct. This process often drives the daemon insane, resulting in a creature of uncontrolled rage and hunger. 
This process also involves equipping the demon with various weapons that are fused into their tortured forms. Each soul grinder comes with a different arsenal of weapons at its disposal, which dictates their preferred forms of combat. Some wield devesting blades and crushing claws, others trample their foes under their mechanical legs, and others bombard their foes from a distance with fiendish artillery.

This fate is said to befall demons who were defeated and unable to fully reform within their demonic plane. Desperate for another chance to wreak havoc, they made a bargain with fiendish smiths who forged them into new bodies. Only by repaying the smiths with a tremendous tally of souls harvested from the Material Plane can the soul grinders be fully restored to their original forms. Those who fail to do so risk becoming trapped in their mechanical forms for eternity. In a cruel form of irony, soul grinders demonstrate that even demons can be damned to a greater form of tortured existence.

# Example Creatures of Chaos 
This section lists examples of creatures from the Monster Manual that have been modified using the options listed in this document. They have been given new demonic abilities, and some have had their spell lists altered. Some of the creatures also have access to new lair actions. These modifications make the creatures more powerful than their normal equivalents, and you should be mindful of their new challenge ratings if you're swapping them into your games.

You can use these creatures as they are in your games, you can modify them in other ways to better suit your adventures, or use them as a jumping-off point for building your own creatures. They are meant to serve as a point of inspiration for you to make your own custom monsters to suit your games. The creatures you create do not necessarily need to be themed as demonic in origin, as the abilities listed in this document can also fit other themes. Have fun creating new twists on familiar creatures and keeping your players on their toes!

## Creatures of Rage
These creatures have been instilled with an insatiable demonic fury, making them all the more deadly in combat. They may worship gods of war, have been corrupted by demons of slaughter, or have sold their souls for greater martial prowess. In battle, they are much more aggressive than their normal kin, rarely showing any sense of restraint or self-preservation.


### Bugbear Warmonger (Bugbear)
These bugbears have forsaken the worship of their traditional gods in favor of a new demon lord of war and carnage who grants them heightened aggression and brutal combat powers. Gone is their laziness and cowardice, for they are concerned only with gathering heads for their lord. Though they still excel at stealth and sneak attacks, once the ambush is executed, these bugbears press their attack no matter the odds until they’ve slaughtered every foe in sight.

### The Bugbear’s Lair

This lair is a shrine devoted to the bugbears’ <br>  demonic patron. In typical bugbear fashion, they <br>  decorate it with grizzly trophies, with severed <br>  heads being a favorite. The rage that permeates <br>  the shrine is so strong it transcends death. The <br>  heads that decorate the lair can become an <br>  instrument of their patron’s wrath, and his grip on <br>  their souls is such that he can call fallen bugbears <br>  into one last act of bloody service before their life is extinguished in his name.

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 2. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any bugbear warmonger can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:


##### Blood-Curdling War Cry

A battle cry rings throughout the lair, and each non-Creature of Rage within the lair must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until initiative count 20 on the next round. While frightened, Creatures of Rage have advantage on melee attack rolls against the creature.

A creature can choose to embrace the battle cry and make the saving throw with advantage. If it succeeds on the saving throw in this way, it goes berserk until initiative count 20 on the next round.


##### Final Fury

Rage fills the room, giving the devoted a final attack in their death throes. Each creature of the bugbear’s choice that has died since the last lair action returns to life with 1 hit point. This action can’t return a creature to life that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts, or revive a creature who has already been revived using this feature. A creature revived this way can choose to stand up immediately and is immune to all damage until the end of its next turn, after which it dies again.


##### Skull Meteor

The bugbear chooses a point on the ground within the lair, which begins to glow menacingly. On initiative count 20 of the next round, one of the room’s severed heads catches on fire and lets loose a war cry as it flies into that point and explodes. Each creature within a 10-foot radius sphere of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking damage 4 (1d8) fire damage and 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Frenzied Hydra (Hydra)
This hydra may be the favored pet of a powerful demon lord who has imbued it with an ungodly temper. Alternatively, it may be a hydra who nested too close to a demonic rift and succumbed to its maddening influence.

\columnbreak

<Br><br>

Regardless, the hydra’s alterations have made it wildly unpredictable and bloodthirsty, willing to attack anything it sees with no provocation. Once it identifies prey, its fury only grows as its many heads rabidly tear through flesh and bone.

### Rage Zombie (Zombie)
The animating force behind this zombie is an unholy rage for the living. These may be former warriors who died violent deaths in service of bloodthirsty demonic overlords, or they may be corpses possessed by demonic spirits of rage.

Regardless of their origin, these corpses possess a fervor unknown to most other zombies. This makes them especially difficult to destroy as their rage drives them to push past grievous injuries and pursue foes with unholy vigor.

## Creatures of Change
These creatures have been warped by eldritch influences of demonic origin, making them unpredictable and granting them abilities that twist reality. They may worship gods of deception and sorcery, have been warped by chaotic, extraplanar energies, or have sacrificed their sanity in pursuit of deeper knowledge of the nature of reality. In battle, they ride the line between cunning and insanity. They are never straightforward with their tactics, preferring guile and trickery and finding ways to catch their opponents off guard whenever possible.

### Warp Devil (Barbed Devil)
This devil has had its essence twisted by raw chaos, turning it into an erratic version of its kind. Warp devils may try to continue their infernal services, but their twisted nature makes them an abomination in the eyes of their kin, and most eventually become mad vagabonds struggling to control their chaotic affliction. However, the devil’s innately lawful form can only contain this chaos for so long before succumbing to the flames of change. . . . . 


### Warpfire Elemental (Fire Elemental)
This elemental being has been created by demonic flames of chaos. Its flames don’t just burn matter but melt through the fabric of reality itself. Warpfire elementals are created during events of chaotic conflagration and seek to burn and warp every living being they come in contact with.

### Oni Deceiver (Oni)

This oni has consorted with demonic forces of deception to access eldritch secrets and enhanced powers of trickery. It now serves those forces to sow chaos across the world, utilizing its arcane powers of confusion and deceit. Though its exact goals are often inscrutable, it always executes its plans with deadly guile. Those who attempt to face the oni deceiver head-on are left befuddled by its magics before meeting a grizzly end.

### Sphinx, Defiler of Fate (Androsphinx)

No longer content to passively study the strands of fate, this sphinx has mastered the demonic arts necessary to twist destiny to its will. From within its sanctum, it studies the stands of destiny, scheming ways to twist the future to its will. Though it believes itself to have mastered fate, the sphinx is little more than another pawn in the game of the demonic lords who granted it this power to begin with.

### The Sphinx’s Lair

This lair is the sanctum from which the sphinx observes and twists the threads of fate. It is here where the sphinx’s power is greatest as it can twist reality to draw on greater reserves of magic and terrify its foes with nightmarish visions of different realities. 

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 5. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

##### Visions of Doom 

The sphinx creates a floating, spectral vision of futures too horrible to describe in a 10-foot cube within the layer that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn. 


\columnbreak

Before it disappears, it may move up to 40 feet, and each creature it passes through or enters its space must make a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw, taking 8d10 psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature can only take this damage once per use of the lair action.

A creature that uses an action to examine the visions can discern their intangible nature by succeeding on a DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation). If a creature discerns the visions for what they are, it automatically passes any saving throw against this lair action and future uses of it.

##### Tome of Power

The sphinx calls forth a floating tome of dark magic that binds to a creature of its choice. The tome follows the chosen creature wherever it goes and occupies the same space as the creature. On initiative count 20 of the next turn, a creature bound to the tome may cast a spell of 5th level or lower with a casting time of one action without expending a spell slot or daily use of the spell (no action required).

The tome is no longer bound to a creature if it dies, falls unconscious, or leaves the lair. If a creature within 5 feet of the tome uses its action to bind to the tome, it becomes bound to that creature. If the tome is already bound to a creature who does not wish to part with it, a contested Intelligence check is made, and the tome binds to the winner.

##### Arcane Surge

The sphinx calls upon magics that begin to swirl around itself out to a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area is magically empowered until the end of its next turn. While empowered this way, the next time the creature rolls damage for a spell, it can roll an additional number of d8s equal to the lair's CR and add them to the damage roll.

In battle, they prioritize <br> inflicting others with their vile abilities over their own <br> well-being, for they embrace the inevitable decay of all <br> things, including themselves.

### Rot Gnoll (Gnoll)
This gnoll has succumbed to rotting demonic influences <br> that have left it putrid and filled with vile gases waiting to burst free. Rot gnolls fly into battle with the same berserk zeal as the rest of their kind, but when they die, their <br> stinking bloated bodies burst in a putrid explosion that <br> leaves behind a choking miasma.

### Pestilent Green Hag (Green Hag)
This hag has devoted herself to the cause of a demonic patron of decay, pledging to spread pestilent beauty across the land. Hags already see loveliness in what most would consider foul and ugly, so dabbling in demonic forces of decay serves as a natural complement to their twisted interests. 

Pestilent green hags are also more likely than most to form covens with other like-minded hags, as their demonic corruption fosters a perverse sense of fellowship. These covens work together to brew up the foulest plagues possible to spread to nearby settlements, an act they refer to as “charity work.” Over time, even their innate fear of death fades as they devote themselves wholly to the cause of “beautifying” the world with every disease imaginable, no matter the cost.


### The Hag’s Lair
This rotting lair is often home to a coven of pestilent hags who work to brew their latest batch of diseases to share with the world. Visitors are gleefully offered an early sampling of their latest “treats”.

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 3. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any pestilent green hag can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:



\columnbreak

##### Rampant Rot

One creature of the hag’s choice within the lair she is aware of must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become infected by rampant rot disease. 

On initiative count 20 each turn, each infected creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage, then each infected creature along with every creature within 10 feet of an infected creature, must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

##### Rot Blessing

The hag becomes covered in pestilent growths, regaining hit points and becoming rot-blessed. On initiative count 20 each turn, each rot-blessed creature regains 30 hit points, and another Creature of Decay within 10 feet of it may gain the rot blessing as well. The rot blessing ends on a creature if it takes radiant or fire damage or is targeted by an effect that cures diseases.

##### Withering Disease

One creature of the hag’s choice within the lair she is aware of must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or become infected by a withering disease. 

On initiative count 20 each turn, each infected creature gains one level of exhaustion, then each infected creature along with every creature within 10 feet of an infected creature, must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. Non-infected creatures become infected on a failed save. Infected creatures that succeed on the save are cured of the disease and cannot be infected by it again for 1 hour.

> ___
> ***Amphibious.*** The hag can breathe air and water.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:<br>
> <br>
> At will: _chill touch, dancing lights, minor illusion_
>
> ***Mimicry.*** The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.
>
> ***Hag Coven.*** When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags continues to desire more personal power.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict, the result is usually chaos.
>
> ***Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only).*** While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:<br>
> <br>
> 1st level (4 slots): _identify, ray of sickness_<br>
> 2nd level (3 slots): _locate object, stream of corruption_<br>
> 3rd level (3 slots): _puddle of ooze, stinking cloud, vampiric touch_<br>
> 4th level (3 slots): _blight, inflict rot_<br>
> 5th level (2 slots): _contact other plane, scrying_<br>
> 6th level (1 slot): _eye bite_<br>
> <br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
>
> ***Hag Eye (Coven Only).*** A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24 hours.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action other than performing the ritual, they must start over.
>
> ***Wax and Wane.*** When the hag rolls initiative, it rolls d6. On an odd number, she is in the Rot state, and on an even number, she is in the Abundance state.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of her turns, the hag switches to the other state.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the Abundance state, the hag gains a +3 bonus to her armor class and saving throws.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in the Rot state, the hag gains a +3 bonus to attack rolls.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observers can tell what state the hag is in by looking at her. For example, the hag may appear haggard or moldy while in the Rot state and energetic and lively while in the Abundance state.
> ### Actions
> ***Claws.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Illusory Appearance.*** The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin, but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern that the hag is disguised.
>
> ***Invisible Passage.*** The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell). While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage, so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or carries is invisible with her.

### Festering Troll (Troll)
This troll has been mutated by demonic forces of decay that have perversely granted it even greater regenerative abilities, allowing its festering wounds to scab over and renew themselves at an unnatural rate. The troll may have gained these abilities after being infected with fiendish diseases or have been “blessed” with them when it became a minion to some other force of decay (such as a coven of pestilent green hags). In combat, the troll fights with little to no regard for its own well-being as its putrid body shrugs off injury after injury, maintaining a constant state of simultaneous rot and renewal.

## Creatures of Excess
These creatures have been granted unholy beauty, grace, and charisma, which allow them to toy with the hearts of others in pursuit of their hedonistic ends. They may worship gods of hedonism, have succumbed to corrupting influences that played on their pride and ego, or have consorted with demonic forces to achieve everlasting beauty, charisma, and decadent pleasure. 

In battle, they see their foes as playthings and sources of amusement. The primary goal of these creatures is their own gratification, and they will fight in ways that they find most pleasing to themselves. This often involves toying with foes and using excessive cruelty in combat. Those who provide no pleasure are removed as quickly and efficiently as possible. 


### Perverse Cloud Giant (Cloud Giant)
This cloud giant has succumbed to its oversized ego and consorted with demonic powers to enhance its beauty and charisma. It now collects humanoids as a child collects toys, forcing them to bask in its presence as it plays with them in any way it sees fit. These captives are often kept in giant-sized doll houses and forced to carry out perverse acts for the giant’s amusement. Other times, it is the giant who puts on twisted performances, horrifying and enrapturing its captive audience.

### Hedonistic Satyr (Satyr)
This satyr’s wild antics have attracted the attention of a demonic lord of excess who has twisted the satyr’s passions into something far darker and more destructive. Hedonistic satyrs now turn their pursuits towards more sinister pleasures, always seeking some new depravity to top the last. Compassion and kinship have faded away, and they now only see others as a means to grant them pleasure and gratification.

If the attack hits, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
> If the target creature tries to teleport, it also provokes an attack of opportunity from the satyr. If the attack hits, the satyr may choose to teleport along with the target creature to the nearest unoccupied space next to the creature where it appears. <br>

### Fallen Unicorn (Unicorn)
This unicorn has fallen from grace and succumbed to pride and narcissism. It has become enamored with its own beauty and wishes to see that same obsessive admiration reflected in others. To achieve this, the fallen unicorn gathers a sycophantic cult of admirers who tend to its every desire. The admirers are made up of the fairest and most graceful individuals the unicorn can find, who it then brainwashes and incorporates into its cult of personality. Those who lose their luster over the years are brutally disposed of, ensuring that the unicorn’s “stable” of humanoids is made up of only the finest specimens.

### The Unicorn’s Lair

The unicorn’s lair is a grove of unearthly and beguiling beauty. The unicorn keeps it stocked with exquisite plants, animals, objects, and individuals who catch its fancy. Individuals who stumble upon the lair are rarely allowed to leave without first being broken into the unicorn’s service if it finds them attractive. Individuals it deems unattractive are ruthlessly disposed of for daring to defile the unicorn’s exquisite home with their presence.


This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 2. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the unicorn can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:



##### Mesmerizing Mirror

The unicorn creates a cursed mirror in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 on the next turn. When a non-Creature of Excess creature first has line of sight of the mirror on its turn, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes mesmerized by the mirror, and all attacks have advantage against the creature while it has line of sight of the mirror, and it can't willingly move away from the mirror. Any creature that can't be charmed automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

##### Overwhelming Narcissism

The unicorn chooses a creature within the lair that it is aware of. The chosen creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with itself. While obsessed this way, the creature's speed becomes 0. It or another creature within reach of it uses an action to shake the creature out of obsession, allowing the target to make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

##### Dreadful Nightmare

The unicorn summons the image of a nightmarish version of itself in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 next turn. When a non-Creature of Excess creature first has line of sight of the image on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it.
