## New conditions 

#### Berserk
The berserk condition lasts for one minute by default, and berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:   <br>
 * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks.
 * The creature can't maintain concentration.
 * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.




#### Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.


##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|


#### Obsessed
The creature becomes fixated on a specific creature or object, which is the source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see the source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for the source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see the source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless the source of its obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away from the source of its obsession.

* 5 to 8 - 4d8 slashing damage.

The maximum spell level of this spell is determined by the CR of the gifted creature. Regardless of whether the spell is cast, the tome disappears at this point.

The tome is no longer bound to a creature if it dies, falls unconscious, or leaves the lair. If a creature within 5 feet of the tome uses its action to bind to the tome, it becomes bound to that creature. If the tome is already bound to a creature who does not wish to part with it, a contested Intelligence check is made, and the tome binds to the winner.
