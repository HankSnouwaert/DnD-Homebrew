# Bonus Holy Warriors Compilation

This document contains an extended list of holy warriors who fantically fight for their faith. They are usually human, but many of them could be members of other races serving different relgions. Regardless of their origin or specific faith, they all share a zealous and militent devotion to their religious order that could push them to acts of heroism or villiany, depending on the needs of your adventure.

## Bonus Flagellants
The following is an extended list of different types of flagellants with specialized abilities beyond what can normally be found in their deranged fellows. They are often found fighting alongside each other and the "standard" flagellants, forming small armies of the End Times.

### Torrid Soul


When fervid religious abandonment takes hold in those who believe the world is dying, a righteous fire can ignite within the spirit of the adherent, known as a torrid soul. Such individuals are commonly found among other extremists as they parade about, flogging themselves with whips in an attempt to purify themselves. Torrid souls, however, have no need for such implements of torture and instead use the very light within them to induce searing pain. When battle is met, their inner radiance begins to burn away their body, and they unleash purging bolts of light on their enemies until the flame within grows so hot that it reduces the torrid soul’s body to ash as an illuminating torrent bursts forth, roasting anything caught within the sacred glow.

#### Torrid Soul Tactics
Maintain a 40-foot distance from enemies until Bloodied or the flagellant has gained 4 or more levels of Fury, at which point, charge into the largest group of enemies


> ##### New Condition: Fury  
> The creature gains levels of Fury that cause its attacks to deal increasing amounts of damage with each level.
> * The creature can only gain levels of Fury during combat, and all levels are lost when combat ends.
> * A creature can gain up to a max of 6 levels of Fury.
> * First time each turn the creature hits a target with an attack, it deals an additional 1d4 damage for each level of Fury it has.
> * A creature also loses all levels of Fury if it becomes Charmed or Frightened, or is affected by the *calm emotions* spell.  It also can't gain levels Fury while under these conditions.

### Martyr

Some who suffer horrific loss do not turn to zealous violence but instead enter a delirium, believing they must sacrifice themselves to save the rest of the world. These martyrs have confidence in their grand ordinance, capable of taking pain and suffering upon themselves, enduring all manner of grievous wounds. Some go around as preachers, attempting to ease the pain of other poor souls they cross paths with, while others accompany crusades, suffering gruesome fates so that their chosen warrior may battle on. To kill such a selfless entity can cause even the most hideous of demons to feel guilt overcome their depraved souls.


\columnbreak

<br>

#### Martyr Tactics
* **Sanctuary:** Forgo the attack action to cast Sanctuary on itself.
* **Healing:** Use *cure wounds* and Selfless Sacrifice on heavily damaged allies.
* **Damage Mitigation:** Apply Guardian’s Gift to mitigate large single-damage effects (e.g., spells or sneak attacks).
* **Suicidal Debuffing:** Use Guardian’s Gift to enable Stain of Sin to target a creature with a low Wisdom saving throw.

### Sacred Champion

Their flagellants are so pertinacious that they are able to weather the brutality of their own self-inflicted punishments and harrowing confrontations with merciless wretches they face. Emerging from such struggles covered in all manner of blood and ichor, with only a fraction of their lives lingering, such veterans who have survived one or more of these encounters—which they believe to be the final battle—may come to the deluded conclusion that they are a savior and that they alone can stop the oncoming reckoning of the world. Such sacred champions attract the attention of holy orders, who see these self-aggrandizing warriors as viable assets and grant them master-crafted weapons to fight in the name of their religion. 

Such mentally unstable individuals, though, are difficult to control. Holy orders use shrewd sermons to influence their champions to aid in their desired cause. Some warriors are merely subjugated in chains or by sacred magics until they can be let loose upon heretical foes. A sacred champion is nearly impossible to stop, withstanding all manner of weapon strikes that would kill any person of sound mind. As the battle rages, a spiritual fury builds within the champion until they unleash a frantic moment, delivering a blurred onslaught of righteous steel on any they deem damned.

#### Sacred Champion Tactics

* **Penitent Flagellation:** Use Penitent Flagellation to increase the flagellant's damage each turn unless at 5+ Levels of Fury or below 15 Hit Points.
* **Reckless Attacks:** Switch to Reckless Attacks when at 3+ Levels of Fury.

### Prophet of The End

There are times when the dire warnings of filth-ridden wanderers are not just paranoid or a vain attempt to grapple with trauma, but a true testament handed down from higher powers of an encroaching conflict that will lead to an age of darkness for the world or even bring it to its finality. Such admonished words from the heavens, heard by a select few, hold both ardent madness and holy power for those who receive them, transforming the receiver into prophets. In the end, these divine avatars spread the grim ordinance that has been handed down to the masses so they might prepare for the coming storm. 

Such figures can amass armies with their doctrines to lead against the evil they have been warned about. Even a greater demon may give pause when facing a force headed by such an emissary of the gods. Their weapons glow pure white and loose radiant power with each blow. As the conflict becomes dire, the prophet loses obsecration, so he and his flock may find redemption within such a final conflict. Such powers are so potent that those who have been cut down in combat will rise once more for a brief moment to crush corrupt foes

* **Reckless Attacks:** Switch to Reckless Attack when at 3+ Fury.
* **Support:** Use Atonement on allies with less than one-third of their hit points or those with on-death effects capable of significant damage (e.g., a Torrid Soul with maximum Fury).

## Witch Hunter Bands
Most witch hunters work alone in their quest to destroy the unholy, but some form small bands with others who have also dedicated themselves to these sacred endeavors. Within these hunting parties, a variety of specialized hunters can be found, each excelling in their own field and wielding unique weapons. The combination of these resolute warriors is a death sentence for any monster or individual deemed guilty of committing atrocities.

\columnbreak

### Woodsman

Woodsmen are specialized hunters who thrive in the shadowy, monster-infested forests. These towering, solemn figures wield axes originally designed for splitting logs. Navigating dense undergrowth where most would fear to tread, they patrol diligently, ever alert for the rustling of leaves or the glint of predatory eyes in the gloom. Many travelers owe their lives to woodsmen who rush forward, positioning themselves between the villain and their next victim, delivering a tree-toppling blow with their axe. These strikes are so powerful that tales are told of woodsmen felling ravenous trolls, hags, and other giant beasts.

#### Woodsman Tactics
The woodsman targets the largest creature with the lowest Dexterity within close range, imposing disadvantage on its attacks against other creatures.

### Marksman

Masters of archery, marksmen are armed with expertly crafted crossbows of enormous proportions. They load these with a varied assortment of thick bolts made from materials such as silver, cold iron, or sacred oak, ensuring no spawn of evil is safe from their wrath. When their quarry is spotted, marksmen position themselves to deliver devastating shots. A well-placed bolt can thrust a pierced creature backward, embedding the arrow in a nearby wall and pinning the victim against it. Most monsters are already dead by the time they are nailed down, becoming macabre decor. 

\columnbreak

<br>

More resilient, nightmarish foes of unnatural constitution may squirm and scream, struggling to escape their restraints, but trapped victims are rarely fast enough to avoid another arrow that either further secures them or ends their miserable existence.

#### Marksman Tactics

The Marksman targets opponents with low Strength, attempting to pin them against walls. They may goad enemies into chasing them by using the Dash or Disengage action, luring them toward a wall to pin them.

### Interrogator

Interrogators are perhaps the most feared breed of witch hunter, dreaded by both the guilty and the innocent. Masters of torture, they excel at extracting confessions and information from anyone they apprehend. Even the most black-hearted and zealous cultist becomes contrite when subjected to the Interrogator’s holy brand, renouncing their dark ways. However, such victims can only hope for their suffering to end in death. 

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Interrogators descend upon towns where they suspect secret covens or cults have taken root. These communities are overwhelmed with terror as the hunters stalk through the night, dragging away anyone they believe knows about blasphemous activities, brutally gathering any information they can.

#### Interrogator Tactics

Interrogators are vindictive and target those they deem most sinful, even if they have high bonuses to Deception.

### Hound Master

Hound masters command one or more fiercely loyal hunting hounds, each subjected to rigorous and ruthless training. These hounds wear collars adorned with charms that ward off dark magic, ensuring they do not falter even when facing the most horrific aberrations. Working in tandem with their masters, the hounds coordinate to outmaneuver even the deadliest adversaries, shredding them in a flurry of blades and teeth. Through perilous excursions, hunter and hounds form a fierce loyalty to one another. Over time, the dogs become as somber as their masters. Should a member of the pack fall in battle, the others exact cruel vengeance on the perpetrator.

\columnbreak

<br>

#### Hound Master and Hounds Tactics

Hound Masters are typically accompanied by two witch hunter's hounds. The hounds dash toward a spellcaster marked by the master, hounds granting him advantage on his musket attack. The master then approaches the target and draws his scimitars to finish them off.

## Lothar Huld
*The Wandering Prophet*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Relics <br>

In a verdant countryside, where emerald hills rolled beneath the watchful gaze of the heavens, there stood a grand monastery, its stones whispering with the prayers of ages, hewn to honor the High God of Light, guardian of the green lands and shepherd of his chosen disciples.

One shadowed eve, a boy appeared at the gates of this hallowed sanctum. Priests, their faces shadowed by sacred cowls, ushered the child within and questioned whence he came. No tale of his past did he offer, save his name—Lothar Huld—and a vow that burned in his voice: to be forged into a slayer of the dark minions of the forsaken gods in the name of the radiant deity of light.
The monks, moved by his fervor, granted him shelter. They raised him within the sacred walls, teaching him the holy tenets of their divine lord and forging his spirit and sinew into a warrior of unyielding resolve. Years passed, and Lothar, tempered by relentless training under the gaze of their lord’s eternal light, emerged a champion bishop of the light, a blazing sword sworn to purge the world of chaos’s brood.

His quest led him to remote hamlets, where unholy marauders—spawn of the forbidden gods—wrought terror upon the innocent. In each village, Lothar’s voice thundered with holy sermons, kindling righteous fervor in the hearts of trembling townsfolk. They rose as one, their fear transmuted into zeal, and followed him into battle. Each swing of his hammer smote a blighted beast; each hallowed prayer made wicked spawn cower and burn in the fires of divine judgment. For in the fury of combat, Lothar became a vessel of his god, wielding his patron’s majesty as a flame against the dark.

Such victories echoed across the land, and the clergy of the great god sang Lothar’s deeds, proclaiming him a prophet. Yet, as his star ascended within the sacred order, Lothar beheld a bitter truth: the corruption he sought to vanquish had taken root within his own faith. Chaplains and priests, swayed by ambition and glittering coin, had forsaken their vows, sullying the name of their lord with conceit and avarice.

With a heart resolute yet shadowed by sorrow, Lothar denounced his brothers, his voice a clarion against their perfidy. Thenceforth, he rode forth upon his black steed, Sanctus, a solitary crusader, rooting out malignant forces wherever they lurked—be they in shadowed glades or the very halls of the righteous. The faith stood divided, torn by his ordained doom. Many within the sect whispered of unease, for priests and bishops, found perverse or in league with the acolytes of the forbidden gods, lay dead—struck down, it was said, by the prophet’s hand.

Now, Lothar rides still, his steed’s hooves heralding the approach of judgment. He declares the end nigh, and the faithful tremble, uncertain whether his path be salvation or the ruin of all he holds dear.

\columnbreak



### Lothar Huld Tactics 
&emsp;**Choosing Targets.** Lothar prioritizes the creature with the lowest Strength to maximize the impact of his Crushing Hammer. He uses Hallowed Judgment against martial fighters with low Wisdom. Condemned is employed to pull in ranged attackers, preventing their escape. When alone, Lothar activates his Reckoning ability on his first turn.

**Holy Followers.** Lothar’s *circle of power* greatly benefits his followers, encouraging them to stay close. As followers accumulate Fury over time, Lothar delays using Reckoning until most are heavily damaged or dead. This maximizes damage of the followers, as followers lose their Fury upon death.

**Sanctus.** When riding Sanctus, Lothar’s tactics remain largely unchanged. He focuses on charging in and out of combat to optimize Sanctus’s Hooves attack.



### Epic Battle: The Grand Prophet 
If you wish to make Lothar into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 390, and give him the Fiery Demagogue trait, described below. This increases his CR to 18. 

***Fiery Demagogue (Recharges after a short or long rest).*** If Lothar Huld becomes Bloodied (195 HP), he may either recharge his Reckoning ability if it has been used, or he may use the ability with expending a use of the feature.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.



> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

> ### Traits  
>  
> ***Fanatical Devotion.*** Lothar has advantage on saving throws against being Charmed or Frightened.  
>  
> ***Reckoning (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** On Initiative Count 30, Lothar can declare a time of reckoning, ending any effects that cause him to be Incapacitated and becoming empowered with holy might until Initiative Count 20 of the next round. While empowered, he has resistance to all damage and advantage on all saving throws.  
>  
> ### Actions  
>  
> ***Multiattack.*** Lothar makes two Crushing Warhammer attacks while empowered*.  
>  
> ***Crushing Warhammer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) Bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) Thunder damage. The target must succeed on a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 18 (DC 21 if Lothar is empowered). <br> *Failure:* Lothar automatically hits the target with another Crushing Warhammer attack as part of this action (this does not tigger another saving throw). <br> *Failure by 10 or more:* The extra attack is a critical hit.  
>  
> ### Bonus Actions  
>  
> ***Spellcasting.*** Lothar can cast *circle of power*, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.
>  
> ### Monstrous Actions  
>  
> Lothar gains two additional actions in combat: Hallowed Judgment and Condemn. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count, separate from Lothar’s. On the action’s initiative count (losing ties), Lothar can take one of these actions if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.  
>  
> ***Hallowed Judgment (Initiative Count 10).*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 18 (DC 21 if Lothar is empowered), one creature of Lothar’s choice within 60 feet that he can see. If Lothar is empowered, he can choose any number of creatures within 60 feet to be affected.  
>  
> *Failure:* The target gains the Burning* condition, taking 11 (2d10) Radiant damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends. While Burning*, the target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius, attack rolls against it have advantage, and it can’t benefit from the Invisible condition.   
>  
> *Failure by 5 or more:* The target is also Frightened. While Frightened, its Burning* condition cannot be ended by nonmagical means. The target can make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the Frightened condition on a success.  
>  
> ***Condemn (Initiative Count 1).*** Lothar, or a creature he is mounted on, moves up to 20 feet in a straight line, then Lothar slams his hammer, unleashing a wave of destruction. *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 18, each creature Lothar chooses in a 15-foot cube originating from him. <bR> *Failure:* The creature takes 10 (3d6) Thunder damage and is pulled 30 feet towards Lothar. <bR> *Failure by 5 or more:* The target is Dazed* until the end of its next turn.  
>  
> If Lothar is empowered, the cube is 30 feet instead of 15 feet.  
>  
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Lothar is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.  
>  
> **New condition described on previous page*
