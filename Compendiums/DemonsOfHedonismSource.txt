# Demons of Hedonism
The following demons each embody certain vices taken to their most hedonistic extremes. The vices include carnality, indolence, and paramountcy, and for each vice, two demons of differing power levels have been included. Rules for creating a boss fight featuring one demon of each vice have been included at the end of the document.


## Hedonists of Carnality
*Lustful, Demonic Seducers & Cruel Sadists*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Implements <br>
From the unholy union of overwhelming physical pain and pleasure arise misbegotten spawn, lissome in form, each bearing two sets of arms. Their pale, claw-tipped hands wield instruments of torture crafted with unparalleled elegance. Every sensuous wound inflicted by their weapons prickles with heavenly bliss, the very purpose for which these debauched creatures exist. A flurry of such wounds is masterfully layered upon their victims’ bodies, crippling them with swelling exhilaration that renders them helpless.

Beyond their capacity to deliver such carnage, these demons can goad others with braided words, luring them to abandon common sense. Some are fools, falling for the creatures’ unearthly allure. Others, seeking to destroy the sadistic beings, are duped with promises of physical satisfaction in vanquishing the vile beast.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Yet, rushing heedlessly toward the tormentor, they leave themselves vulnerable to its blows, their righteous smiting swiftly corrupted into an act of dark ecstasy.

The epitome of this demon breed is the true scourge, for as they sustain lethal injuries, they are stirred into euphoric frenzies.

### Hedonist of Carnality Tactics

Hedonists of carnality aim to Daze and Grapple as many targets as possible during combat. Once a target sustains four Wounds, the hedonist shifts focus to a new target. They prioritize targets they have an advantage against, primarily gained through their Temptation of Carnality ability. If the hedonist has advantage on several targets, it will target ranged characters first.

If the creature ends its turn without making a melee attack, it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

> ##### New Condition: Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
>
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

## Hedonists of Indolence
*Lazy, Corpulent Demons That Induce Fatigue & Drowsiness*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Armaments <br>
The uninspired and slothful behavior of mortals can coalesce into the portly demons known as hedonists of indolence. Humanoid in form, they are covered in mountains of fat wrapped in soft lavender skin, supported by trunk-like legs with silver hooves that ring like singing bowls with each step. Upon their bulbous heads, strange, branch-like structures twist and turn, inducing weariness in those who witness their movement. These demons exude a listlessness so potent that it drains the vigor from those around them. Feeding on the inaction caused by this aura, they exist solely to see mortals falter and become overwhelmed by indifference.

In the heat of combat, these demons remain lethargic, wielding golden blades with the ineptitude of a drunkard. Yet, such flawed technique should not be underestimated. Even if a lackadaisical swing misses, the gilded blade whistles through the air, humming a melody of defeat that dulls the minds of all who hear it. As weary adversaries attempt to counterattack through the tiring miasma, their strained efforts fall short, and thoughts of failure arise. These thoughts are amplified by the demon until they blaze in the victim’s mind, tearing it apart. Such foes may collapse listless at the demon’s cloven feet without ever being touched by its gilded weapon.

The greater epitomes of these creatures are deadly monstrosities. The closer a foe comes to defeating the demon, the greater the effort they must muster to continue fighting these apathetic wretches, for the demons gain power from their own shortcomings. The emanations of laxness they exude become all the more potent, sapping adversaries’ will to battle. Struggling against the indolent demon, foes collapse as the grasp of near victory slips away.

### Hedonists of Indolence Tactics
Hedonists eliminate opponents through Fatigue. They target either the creature that has the most hit points or the creature that is under the effect of their Temptation of Indolence.

**Crushing Lethargy (Epitome Only).** This ability is saved for another target that is not the primary focus of the demon's attacks, generally a spellcaster.

> The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> 
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> 
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
>
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.

> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue.

## Hedonists of Paramountcy
*Prideful, Demonic Spellcasters & Narcissistic Show-Offs*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Arcane <br>
A truly ostentatious sight to behold, the Hedonists of Paramountcy arise from the desire for power that clutches the hearts of the most egotistical mortals. Adorned in royal dresses of flowing satin, their near-human forms are decorated with mastercrafted jewelry made of otherworldly metals encrusted with exquisite gems. Their demonic nature is revealed, for in place of legs, they are kept aloft by two slithering, tattooed tails that coil endlessly. 

These regal entities are megalomaniacal, striving for nothing less than to bend all around them to their whims and elicit unceasing praise. To achieve this domination, they artfully manipulate others by nurturing the same urges of vanity that have overtaken their own existence. The scheming demon praises mortals, giving them an inflated sense of their skills and self-importance, even granting boons to such targets to push their capabilities to the limit. 

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Such attention erodes the mortal’s humility, as monstrous pride supplants it, leaving them devoid of humility and causing them to denounce any dependence on others. Once corruption has taken its course and self-grandiosity isolates the mortal from their allies, the demon strikes, shattering all delusions of superiority and forcing the fool to grovel before their splendid master.

These tyrannical creatures wield more than just artful inflation of ego. So boundless is their hunger for supremacy that they can seize the winds of magic using great scepters, icons of their unquestionable authority. Such sorcery allows them to levitate, conjure whips of psychic energy that release ear-piercing wails when cracked, or force groups of lesser creatures into involuntary, humiliating dances for the demon’s bemusement. 

The most powerful among these creatures are known as the Epitomes, and are so persuasive that they applaud their adversaries mid-combat, delivering affected congratulations for their masterful attacks, leaving would-be slayers flattered and dumbfounded. Yet the true threat emerges when the demon’s superiority is jeopardized. Vitriolic spite boils within the monster, fueling its spells to new zeniths, allowing it to maintain its position of dominance.

### Hedoist of Paramountcy Tactics
These demons prioritize targeting isolated enemies and have the following actions:

* **Chaotic Pavane.** The hedonist's opening move, used when it can affect two or more targets, preferably frontline fighters or Quickened creatures. This spell keeps opponents separated, and the forced dodge action is ineffective if the target is isolated.
* **Vicious Lash:** The hedonist's primary spell, aimed at affecting at least two targets. The attack roll is preferably made against a creature with no allies within 5 feet, though the hedonist will not sacrifice hitting additional targets to gain this advantage.
* **Staff of Paramountcy:** Used when the hedonist is Quickened or cannot affect two or more targets with Vicious Lash. The staff's fear effect keeps enemies separated.
* **Words of Praise (Epitome Only)** This is used on any creature that has the Multiattack feature or is Quickened.


\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

## Discordant Triads
Occasionally, three demonic hedonists—each embodying a different vice—are compelled to unite, either out of cold pragmatism or for the amusement of a powerful demon lord. Their extreme temperaments spark endless bickering, yet when faced with a common foe they cooperate with deadly precision.

What truly makes a Discordant Triad so lethal is their shared bond: whenever one member falls, its power is absorbed by the survivors, and the last demon standing emerges exponentially stronger—an avenging force of unimaginable wrath.

### Discordant Triad Battle

A Discordant Triad is composed of a Hedonest of Carnality, a Hedonest of Indolence, and a Hedonest of Paramountcy. You may also substitute epitome variants if desired.

Each member of the Triad gains a new upgrade when another member dies, as shown in the table below.

#### Discordant Triad Tactics
The Trifold of Discord are selfish creatures and will not risk their own safety for the group. When using the Epitome version, their power increases with the damage they take, so spreading damage across all three members enhances their effectiveness.

**Hedonist of Indolence:** Targets the enemy with the highest hit points. Other Trifold members should avoid attacking this target to maximize damage efficiency.

\columnbreak

**Hedonist of Carnality:** Moves between targets to daze as many as possible, prioritizing those with Temptation of Paramountcy. Grapples targets, especially those with Temptation of Carnality, to set up *vicious lash*.

**Hedonist of Paramountcy:** Uses spells to hit and disrupt multiple targets. Targets with Temptation of Indolence are prime candidates for *chaotic pavane*.

##### Discordant Triad Upgrade Table  

| Triad Members Dead | Hedonest of Carnality Upgrade  | Hedonest of Indolence Upgrade | Hedonest of Paramountcys Upgrade |
|:----------------------:|:----------------------|:----------------------|:----------------------|
|  1  | 	Whenever a creature within 60 feet of the Hedonest takes damage from one or more Wounds, it suffers a Wound. | Locus of Indolence now deals 11 (2d10) Psychic damage. | The Hedonest can cast a spell in place of one of its attacks when taking the Attack action. It can also cast *chaotic pavane* at will.| 
|  2  | 	Creatures within 60 feet of the Hedonest take 1d8 Necrotic damage from each Wound instead of 1d4. | When a creature gains one or more levels of Fatigue, it becomes Drowsy until the end of the Hedonest's next turn. | Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the Hedonest's *vicious lash* spell, it becomes Dazed until the end of the Hedonest's next turn.|



___
___
> ##### *The Dance of Discord*
> *In the chaotic realms of the wicked, three demons wandered, each bound to a singular vice. One reveled in Indolence, another burned with Carnality, and the third craved Paramountcy. Though consumed by their desires, they served a greater demon lord of unfathomable malice, whose cruelty was legendary.*
> 
> *When this great lord grew bored with his tormented souls, he assembled his demons into an army to steal souls from another abyssal lord. Yet the three pleasure-demons sabotaged his plans, driven by petty rivalries and ambitions. Their infighting fractured the army, and demon fought demon in violent turmoil.*
> 
> *Other lords of chaos learned of this betrayal and dispatched their legions, swiftly destroying the weakened host. Defeated and humiliated, the trio fled back to their master’s shadowed halls. Upon learning of their failure, the great lord rose in terrible wrath, ready to inflict eternal punishment.*
> 
> *Yet, as the demons cowered and blamed each other, their master's rage softened into sadistic amusement. Instead of punishing them, he bound their souls with a sinister curse: they could never harm one another directly. He gave them a second chance to wander chaos and redeem themselves; if successful, their bond would shatter, and they would be free.*
>
> *Thus, the three roam endlessly, forever bickering over the path to redemption, spreading sin and ruin wherever they tread. Their victories are inevitably undone by mutual spite, delighting each in the others' failures. Such depravity allows their tormented victims to rise and slay them, but their souls return to their master’s palace. There, reborn and still bound together, they are cast out again.*
>
> *And ever their master laughs wickedly upon his throne of shadowed mirth, knowing no salvation awaits these misbegotten servants, doomed forever to torment one another in an eternal, twisted dance.*

## New Spells

#### Chaotic Pavane
*3rd-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:**  30 feet
- **Components:** V S M (a bit of catgut)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

Each creature in a 15-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected for the duration.

On a failed save, the creature begins a painful, involuntary dance. While dancing, the creature:

* Can't take reactions or bonus actions.
* Must stand up if Prone, spending 5 feet of movement to do so.
* Must take the Dodge action.
* Must immediately use all its movement in a random direction. Roll 1d4 to determine the direction: 1—north, 2—east, 3—south, 4—west.

At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If it did not move during its turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the creature falls Prone and the effect ends for it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The affected creature takes 1d10 Bludgeoning damage whenever it moves due to the spell. This damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

Hit or miss, the target and each creature in the line between you and it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 psychic damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the Thunder and Psychic damage increase by 1d6, and the spell’s range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.
