# Ratfolk Compendium

The ratfolk are a race of humanoid rat creatures who blend aspects of both species to create a creature with a human's guile and the rat's verminous instincts. They appear in many fantasy settings with different names, cultures, and attributes. However, most ratfolk will possess rodent-like traits, cultures, and personalities, including skittish dispositions, the tendency to operate in large groups, and a propensity for living underground or in ruins.

If you're running games in a setting with ratfolk or choose to include them in your custom setting, you could feature them as another humanoid race alongside the classic fantasy races such as elves and dwarves, giving them their own culture and making them a playable option. Alternatively, you could run a setting where ratfolk are an unequivocally evil threat, turning them into an excellent adversary for your players. If you wish to include a limited number of ratfolk without having to integrate them into your world, you could make them a one-off creation, resulting from magical experiements or otherwordly bargains gone wrong.

This document provides content to help you run games featuring ratfolk in their various incarnations. These incarnations focus on a handful of different "flavors" or ratfolk: ratfolk soldiers, ratfolk mystics, plague-bringing ratfolk, ratfolk ninjas, ratfolk engineers, and ratfolk who specialize in creating rat-like monstrosities. There is also content related to rats and rat-monsters. You can have the ratfolk in your setting focused on any one of these themes, or you can mix and match the different themes to create a wide variety of ratfolk in your setting.

The document contains ratfolk-themed player options, including a player race, racial feats, and new spells and items. There are also new magic items, including entirely new types of items ranging from siege weapons to self-powered vehicles. These new types of items come with their own rule sets that can be used even outside of games featuring ratfolk. Finally, the document features a bestiary of different ratfolk creatures to throw at your players, including some example encounters to help you get started. Many sections will be divided based on the different ratfolk themes to make it easier to keep a thematic cohesion to your ratfolk, but you can mix and match them as you see fit.

# Introducing Ratfolk

These devious and opportunistic humanoids scurry within the shadowy recesses of other civilizations, where they scheme ways to advance themselves and bring ruin upon their hated enemies.  And the enemies of a ratfolk are many, for most other humanoids view them with fear and disdain.  Thus, ratfolk live hidden within swamps, caves, sewers, or the ruins of other humanoids.  From here, they can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive. 


### Nimble and Devious
Though ratfolk possess natural agility and a vicious bite, they don't typically confront their foes head-on.  Their smaller frames and lack of resources have made ratfolk accustomed to fighting at a disadvantage.  As such, ratfolk rarely believe in fighting fair. They are twitchy and quick to scurry away if they perceive themselves in a losing fight.  

Skilled ratfolk can use this natural tendency to their advantage as they whittle enemies down with hit and run tactics.  Ratfolk also become more confident when attacking in numbers and quickly become more vicious when they are part of a swarm overwhelming their foes.

\columnbreak



If worst comes to worst and they are forced to flee, ratfolk can quickly squeeze their way into tight crevices to escape attackers.  This ability also gives them a substantial combat advantage when fighting in their claustrophobic underground homes, where they can pop from hidden alcoves to attack unsuspecting intruders.

### Bringers of Plague and Ruin
Most ratfolk live brutal lives in which pure survival is prioritized above all else.  The idea of shunning a source of power out of fear of corruption or avoiding tactics because they are dishonorable is absurd to them.  As such, ratfolk are known to be masters of many powers and abilities other races consider sinister.  Many ratfolk become deadly assassins, some possessing a supernatural mastery of their wicked craft.  Others tap into the notoriety of rats for swarming through civilization and spreading plagues.  These ratfolk may become carriers for terrible diseases which they can inflict upon their victims, or they may learn to command swarms of other vermin to overwhelm their foes.  Even ratfolk who pursue power through more conventional martial means utilize fear and underhanded tactics to obtain that power.



### Crafty Innovators
In their scramble to find new ways to survive, many ratfolk find innovative ways to use the limited resources at their disposal.  These ratfolk make for natural tinkerers, artificers, and engineers, and their creations are built to deliver powerful results at any cost.  This mindset results in many brilliant but perilous designs.  The weapons created by ratfolk are often as dangerous to the wielder as the weapon's target.  Successful engineers have others test their devices for them, only using the most tried and true designs themselves.  

### Ratfolk Names
In some settings, ratfolk take names similar to those of nearby humanoids.  Other times, ratfolk develop naming conventions of their own.  First names are usually short, squeaky, and chittering.  Surnames emphasize imposing traits or deeds, and ratfolk often take on new surnames they find useful for maintaining their status.  Some ratfolk will even discard their first name altogether and only be referred to by an imposing title.  Ratfolk names generally don't distinguish between the genders.

# Running Ratfolk Adventures 

The nature of ratfolk and the names they go by varies from setting to setting. However, adventures that pit players against evil ratfolk usually feature them as unscrupulous and underhanded adversaries who utilize stealth and overwhelming numbers to compensate for other shortcomings. Ratfolk often dwell in formerly abandoned towns or the sewers of cities occupied by other humanoids. They may also construct their own hidden settlements underground or within deadly swamps. From these dwellings, they can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive.  

Players may come into conflict with ratfolk who are launching an attack on other humanoids, or they might stumble across ratfolk lairs in the wild or while exploring urban ruins. This section provides suggestions on how to run adventures featuring the different types of ratfolk players may encounter on their adventures.


## General Ratfolk  Clans
The most common types of ratfolk players are likely to encounter are foot soldiers, who range from lowly slaves to mighty warlords leading entire clans. Some ratfolk forces may also include a grey prophet who serves as a powerful mystic and spiritual leader for the clan.

### Ratfolk Motivations
Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. Many carry an everpresent sense of fear and inferiority and thus grab at power as a means of mitigating these insecurities. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk with specialized skills will seek mastery in that skill as a means of elevating themselves while also seeking to sabotage any rivals. 

Lowly ratfolk slaves will leap at any chance to bully another creature, and ratfolk warlords seek to expand the size of their territory and clan. All ratfolk take particular glee in seeing the works of rival races reduced to ruin and will bring about such ruin for its own sake as it facilitates a sense of superiority amongs their kind.

Ratfolk with more mystical inclinations, such as grey prophets, may appear to give up this selfish drive in service of their divine calling, but they, too, seek power. Their service is merely a means of gaining access to eldritch powers, which they can use to elevate themselves amongst their clan, and they often walk the fine line between doing what their divine masters require of them and utilizing their gifts to achieve their selfish ends.



#### General Ratfolk Motivations
* Securing resources or territory for a clan
* Bringing ruin upon a feared enemy
* Acquiring items that enhance the ratfolk’s power or can serve as a status symbol
* Increasing status among the clan
* Avoiding the wrath of higher-ranking clan members

\columnbreak

#### Grey Prophet Motivations
* Serving the will of an otherworldly master
* Securing eldritch lore or powerful magic items
* Gaining influence over other clans
 


### Ratfolk Tactics
Ratfolk rarely have the advantage over their foes in terms of individual power and must instead rely upon cunning and numbers. Grand strategic goals are pursued using deception, betrayal, and securing large numbers of allies. Ratfolk are opportunistic schemers by nature and can flip from cowering hesitation to brutal aggression the moment they see an opening to pursue their goals. Though ratfolk are quick to backstab one another to pursue their ends, they naturally unite into overwhelming verminous mobs when faced with an outside threat. These tactics carry over into how ratfolk engage the players in combat.

#### Engagement
Ratfolk rarely engage enemies on anything approaching even footing. They don’t start a fight unless they’ve caught the players off-guard, have overwhelming numbers, or have a terrain advantage. If they’re able, ratfolk will surround the players before making their presence known using their natural stealthiness. They will also try to fight in dark and claustrophobic environments where their darkvision and Crevice Crawler abilities allow them to sneak up from unexpected directions.


#### Combat

So long as they believe they have the upper hand, ratfolk are vicious combatants to the point of recklessness. They will dogpile an isolated or otherwise vulnerable opponent and utilize their Overwhelming Mass feature to rack up brutal amounts of damage. If the players manage to regroup to support whoever is being ganged up on, the ratfolk will scatter using their Scurry Away feature before rallying to reattempt the same tactic. Fighting in an environment with tight spaces the players can’t easily move through helps facilitate this fighting style.

#### Retreat
Ratfolk aren’t shy about retreating if a fight doesn’t appear to be going well. If ratfolk force as a whole is doing well, individual ratfolk will often fight to the death. However, their morale plummets once they no longer perceive themselves as having the upper hand. This may happen if the ratfolk lose more than half their fighting force or their leader is slain, and their enemies don’t appear to be near defeat. Under these circumstances, most ratfolk will flee if they have lost at least half their health, face a foe they don’t outnumber, or see multiple nearby allies flee.

## Ninja Ratfolk Clans

Adventures that pit players against ratfolk with ninja-like capabilities usually feature them as unscrupulous and underhanded adversaries who utilize speed, stealth, and agility to catch players off-guard and exploit their weaknesses. These ninja ratfolk dwell within secret lairs or hidden dispersed amongst larger populations where they can better remain hidden. 

Players may come into conflict with ninja ratfolk who are launching raids on other humanoids or performing sinister covert operations. Players may be called upon to foil a ninja clan’s attempts at assassination, theft, espionage, or sabotage. They may also be sent to hunt down ninja ratfolk or discover the whereabouts of their masters or the location of their clan’s lair.


### Ninja Ratfolk Motivations


Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk of the ninja clans see obtaining mastery of their deadly arts as the most reliable means of obtaining power and elevating their status. Mastery and status are obtained by carrying out missions on behalf of their clan or whoever is paying for their services. As such, most of their motivations will be tied to carrying out whatever task has been assigned to them. Individuals within the clan may have their own personal agendas, but should they be caught crossing the clan, they will be quickly eliminated.

#### Example  Ninja Ratfolk Motivations
* Carrying out missions on behalf of their clan
* Seeking esoteric knowledge, training, or items to help further the mastery of their art
* Ascending through the ranks of their clan
* Finding formidable challenges to overcome, so as to prove their worth
* Acquiring secrets that can be leveraged for power

### Ninja Ratfolk Tactics
Ninja ratfolk utilize cunning, stealth, and ruthless opportunism to achieve their goals. These tactics apply to both grand strategic goals and moment-to-moment combat maneuvers. They are never obvious about their intentions or how they plan to achieve their ends, and these ratfolk almost always have a trick up their sleeve or some contingency plan to fall back on should they face challenging resistance.

#### Engagement

Ninja ratfolk never engage enemies on fair terms and will always look to strike when and where they are least expected. They usually avoid fights where they can’t dictate how the battle is started and almost always attempt to begin engagements with an ambush. Attacking players under cover of darkness is their preferred method. Still, they may also hide their agents amongst other ratfolk forces and only reveal themselves once the players have left one of their more vulnerable party members open to a sneak attack. 

\columnbreak



Ratfolk ninjas also enjoy attacking players who are engaged with other foes, making it much easier to sneak up on unsuspecting party members. If the players manage to catch them on the back foot, most ratfolk ninjas will attempt to retreat and regroup for a surprise counterattack when the players are more vulnerable.

#### Combat

Ratfolk ninjas all make heavy use of hit-and-run tactics. They rarely stand toe-to-toe with formidable opponents and prefer to focus their attacks on players who are easy to hit and quick to bring down. Their high mobility and ability to disengage from fights make it hard for players to pin them down and easy for them to reach fragile players. 

Beyond these skirmishing strategies, ratfolk ninjas still make use of their standard racial abilities. They attack in groups whenever possible, enabling both their sneak attacks and their Overwhelming Mass ability. Scurry Away and Crevice Crawler also make retreat into tight spaces where players cannot follow all the easier.

#### Retreat
Ninja ratfolk quickly flee if they find themselves on the back foot, and many of their strategies involve retreating from surprise attacks the moment the players have had the chance to gain their bearings. The fact that they can use their Cunning Action feature while frightened as a result of their Scurry Away feature helps facilitate this. 

They will leave the players wounded with their resources drained and wait to strike again when their guard is down to slowly sap the players of their fighting capability. If the players manage to deal severe damage to the ratfolk ninja force and successful counterattacks seem unlikely, they will flee the area entirely. 

Though ninja ratfolk are quick to flee, those who have ascended beyond the rank of gloom runner rarely due so with the blind panic of ordinary ratfolk. Their disciplined training allows them to maintain a level head, and their retreats are made in a much more tactical manner.

## Ratfolk Engineers
Adventures that include ratfolk engineers often feature them as eccentric, if not mad, engineers and tinkerers. Their creations prioritize power and over-the-top results over safety and reliability. As such, they need underlings who are adept at utilizing unstable devices or expendable enough to be of little consequence should a weapon or vehicle fail catastrophically. These ratfolk setup their labs in underground lairs or abandoned ruins where they can develop their devices without interference before unleashing them on the wider world.

Players may come into conflict with ratfolk engineers who are selling their inventions to nefarious actors, testing their weapons against innocent targets, or hunting for rare and dangerous materials to construct their next contraption. The players may also be sent to stop the construction of deadly weapons, collect information on the technical capabilities of these ratfolk, or even hijack their advanced armaments out from under them.

### Ratfolk Engineer Motivations
Ratfolk are power-seeking creatures by nature. The type of power they covet and how they obtain it depends on the type of ratfolk. Ratfolk engineers see their creations as the highest representation of power, and the intelligence and resourcefulness needed to craft such devices are seen as a sign of their superiority. Those who can create the most powerful and impressive inventions have the highest status among the engineers, and each one is always striving to outdo their competitors. As such, most of their motivations will be tied to their drive to create, test, and utilize their inventions. This utilization could include using the inventions themselves or selling them to an ally or customer. Outside of this, ratfolk engineers are usually only concerned with sabotaging rivals and stopping anyone who interferes with their work.

#### Example Ratfolk Engineer Motivations
* Gathering material or knowledge needed for the creation of devices
* Testing inventions 
* Providing devices to allies or customers
* Sabotaging a rival engineer
* Perfecting an existing device 

### Ratfolk Engineer Tactics
Most ratfolk engineers rely more on their eldritch devices than their martial capabilities. These devices are often overly complex and can have catastrophic effects for those they're used against as well as those using them. This complicated, high-risk, high-reward mindset seeps into how ratfolk engineers apply their tactics and larger strategies. Because so many of their plans are prone to explosive failure, they utilize their high intelligence to come up with many sets of contingencies. Ironically, their intellect often proves to be their undoing, as they usually opt for the most complicated tactics and strategies that showcase their brilliance rather than what's simple and effective.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Engagement
Because ratfolk engineers are dependent on their devices, they will always opt to engage foes when their weapons are as fully prepped as possible and at the optimal distance from foes. Because many of their most powerful weapons are vehicles and long-range war machines, ratfolk engineers are unusual among their kind in that they often prefer fighting in wide open spaces. In open battlefields, they can engage foes from a distance with war machines while their devastating vehicles run rampant.

#### Combat
When the weaponry of the ratfolk engineers is able to perform optimally, it is absolutely devastating. However, even if their weapons aren't malfunctioning, they still don't do well if enemies can close in on them. To buy themselves time and give themselves space, ratfolk engineers will often throw expendable minions at their foes, the sorts of minions they don't mind blowing up in the crossfire of their weapons. Even their weapons operators are expendable to an extent, and backup operators are usually kept on hand if any are killed by their own weapons. Collateral damage is par for the course with ratfolk engineers as long as their foes are caught in the devastation.

#### Retreat
So long as these ratfolk have a ready supply of weapons and gadgets to throw at their foes, they are unlikely to retreat. Once they are all out of weapons that can be used effectively, things immediately change, and most will panic and flee. This turning point could be when they run out of ammo or fuel, when most of their weapons have been destroyed or disabled, or when their foes have closed the distance on their long-range weaponry.

More wisened ratfolk will see these situations coming and save some sort of contingency for their escape. They may pull back before running out of ammo, flee while they still have fuel, ensure that there's still cannon fodder to slow the players down, or have some handy gadget they save for emergencies. The most devious ratfolk may even devise ways to detonate their weapons as a last-ditch attempt to defeat the players or at least impede their ability to give chase.

## Ratfolk Packmasters & Warbeasts
Adventures that focus on ratfolk packmasters are likely to include the myriad of mutant monsters they create, sell, and deploy in battle. Low-level members of these ratfolk clans serve as handlers (and occasionally snacks) for the clan's various monsters. Those who rise through the ranks take on the roles of commanders and beast trainers, and those at the top become the deranged alchemists who breed, mutate, and stitch together new monsters in their dark labs. These labs are usually established near sources of wild beasts that can be captured for experimentation and need ready access to hex stone to power their unholy devices and rapidly mutate their test subjects.

Players may come into conflict with ratfolk packmasters who are selling their monsters to unscrupulous armies, unleashing their creations upon hapless populations, or hunting down beasts for use in their foul experiments. The players may be sent to stop the creation of a new horrific creature, rescue captives captured for experimentation, or even unleash all the monsters in a bestiary so they can rampage through a ratfolk lair.

### Ratfolk Packmaster & Warbeast Motivations
Ratfolk are power-seeking creatures by nature. The type of power they covet and how they obtain it depends on the type of ratfolk. Ratfolk packmasters see the monsters they create and command as the highest representation of power. The mad genius needed to create such creatures and the brutal will needed to command them are seen as marks of superiority among their clans. Those who can piece together the most dreadfully menacing monstrosities and successfully utilize them have the highest status among the packmaster clans. As such, most of their motivations will be tied to their drive to create, dominate, and utilize the most powerful monstrosities possible. This utilization could involve using the monsters themselves or selling them to an ally or customer. Outside of this, ratfolk packmasters are usually only concerned with sabotaging rivals and stopping anyone who interferes with their work.

The monsters themselves generally have very simple motivations. When not being directed by handlers, they generally only care about killing and feeding on any creatures nearby. As part of their creation, they generally have heightened aggression and a reduced sense of self-preservation and will recklessly hunt down any potential prey they come across.

#### Example Ratfolk Packmaster Motivations
* Gathering material or knowledge needed for the creation of monsters
* Testing capabilities of monsters
* Providing monsters to allies or customers
* Sabotaging a rival packmaster
* Perfecting an existing monsters through mutations and other enhancement

### Ratfolk Packmaster <Br> & Warbeast Tactics
Most ratfolk from the packmaster clans rely heavily on the many monsters at their disposal rather than their own martial capabilities. Though these monsters usually aren't capable of devising complex strategies on their own, when commanded by competent packmasters, they become deadly combatants who can be utilized to execute sophisticated tactics. In this way, the ratfolk serve as the brains and their beasts the muscle. The more capable the ratfolk, the more types of monsters it can manage in combat, with the most skilled packmasters managing the strengths and weaknesses of multiple types of monsters at once to maximize their effectiveness.

#### Engagement
Ratfolk packmasters will always try to engage foes in whichever way keeps their war beasts between them and the enemy. Whether they can sneak up on their foes will depend on the monsters they're utilizing and how much control they have over them. Oftentimes, all the packmasters can do is goad their monsters in the direction of the players and hope for the best.

#### Combat
The effectiveness of ratfolk packmasters depends almost entirely on how well they can utilize the monsters at their command. The ratfolk must balance keeping themselves out of harm's way with staying close enough to their monsters to effectively direct and enhance their capabilities. Oftentimes, the more powerful the creation, the less control the ratfolk have over it. So, some fights may involve packmasters coordinating multiple weaker monsters, while others may center more around horrifically powerful monsters, with the ratfolk simply doing what they can to sabotage the players. 

#### Retreat
So long as these ratfolk have monsters at their disposal, they are unlikely to retreat. As stated earlier, in combat, the ratfolk serve as the brains and their beasts the muscle. If the ratfolk are neutralized, the beasts will keep on mindlessly fighting. If the beasts are neutralized, the ratfolk will likely panic and flee. If the ratfolk see they are losing the fight before all their monsters have been slain, they will likely throw whatever creatures remain at the player to try to slow them down as they make their escape. More cunning ratfolk will usually make sure they have a creature or two held in reserve to cover their escape.

# New Player Options
The following player options include a new race along with new feats, weapons, spells, and magic items. You can make some or all of these options available to your players or even have them uncover some of them through play to make them more of a surprise. The new feats have been spread out so that each one is alongside the new player option it is meant to complement.

## New Race: Ratfolk
Some ratfolk find it in their best interest to bargain with and even form alliances with other races.  These alliances are almost always created out of a sense of survivalist pragmatism, and most ratfolk won't hesitate to cast them aside once they are no longer of use.  But some exceptional or desperate ratfolk will find themselves tangled in long-term partnerships with members of other races to achieve common goals.  These ratfolk are almost always adventurers of some sort and can make for useful and dangerous allies.

For more background information on ratfolk culture, see Introducing Ratfolk (pg. 3)

### Ratfolk Traits
Your ratfolk has the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Ratfolk mature quickly and usually live brutally short lives.  They reach adulthood at 8 and have a natural lifespan of 40 years, though most don't even live half that long.

***Alignment.*** The cutthroat nature of ratfolk society results in them leaning heavily towards chaos over order.  Their emphasis on survival at all costs pulls ratfolk towards neutrality, if not outright evil, though exceptional individuals may push back against this. 

***Size.*** Ratfolk are usually shorter and scrawnier than most humans.  Adult ratfolk usually reach 4 to 5 feet in height and weigh 70 to 110 pounds, with exceptionally well-fed individuals reaching 6 feet and weighing up to 160 pounds.  

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

Most ratfolk walk with a hunch, making them appear shorter.  Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

***Crevice Crawler.*** You can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than you without squeezing.

***Bite.*** Your razor-sharp jaws are a natural weapon you can use to make unarmed strikes.  If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.  You can also use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls you make with your bite.

***Overwhelming Swarm.***  When you damage a target with an attack or a spell, you can cause the attack or spell to deal an extra 1d4 damage for each of your allies within 5 feet of the target that isn't incapacitated.  You can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.  Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

At 5th level, the damage dice change to d6s.  At 10th level, they become d8s.  At 15th level, they become d10s.  And at 20th level, they become d12s.

***Scurry Away.*** When a creature you can see ends its turn, you can move up to half your speed away from it as a reaction, and you become frightened of it until the end of your next turn.  This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.  While frightened this way, you can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action.  This ability ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

***Verminous Instincts.*** You gain proficiency in Perception. 

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon.

### Ratfolk Adventurers
Most settings do not feature ratfolk, let alone playable ratfolk.  However, the DM and some players in the group may want the opportunity to try playing such a character without needing to shoehorn an entire race into the world.  In this case, the following options can provide some possible origins for ratfolk individuals in settings otherwise devoid of them:

##### Ratfolk Adventurer Orgins
| d10  | Adventurer Origin |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | One of your parents was a wererat, leaving you born with bizarre ratlike traits. |
|  2  | Your attempt at curing yourself of your wererat lycanthropy left you trapped in a hybrid rat-humanoid state.   |
|  3  | You were once an ordinary rat living in a town subjected to a dark curse, causing its rodent population to mutate into humanoids and overrun its former inhabitants. |
|  4  | You were once a lab rat used in a twisted project to mutate and rapidly evolve rodents.  You were one of the first successes.  |
|  5  |You were testing an experimental new form of teleportation but didn't notice the rat with you.  When you both finished your journey, you had fused into a single entity. |
|  6  | You were once the familiar of a powerful and reclusive archmage.  Tired of having one-way conversations with you, the mage transformed you into an intelligent humanoid.   |

|  |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  7  | You betrayed the secrets of a powerful fey, who devised an ironic way of punishing you for "ratting" them out. |
|  8  | You stole a cursed item crafted with a unique way of punishing "thieving rats."  |
|  9  |You serve an otherworldly being strongly associated with rats and vermin, and this being has chosen to "bless" you with its gifts. |
|  10  |A powerful magical individual with delusions of godhood is attempting to craft a new race of verminous worshippers, and you are one of the first members of this fledgling species. |

## New Ratfolk Feats

### Cunning Crafter
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>

You've become adept at tinkering and using devices in devious ways, granting you the following benefits:
* Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You can use your action to perform object interactions and use magic items while frightened by your Scurry Away trait.
* You gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice, and you can use that type of tool as a spellcasting focus for any spell you cast that uses Intelligence as its spellcasting ability.

\pagebreak

### Devious Adversary
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>

You've practiced scurrying in and out of combat and dispatching foes in underhanded ways, granting you the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* When you use your Scurry Away trait on a creature within 5 feet of you, you may choose to make a bite attack with disadvantage against that creature as part of the same reaction before you move.
* When a creature you have been frightened of by your Scurry Away feature since the start of your last turn misses an attack against you, any fear you have of that creature ends. You may then use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards it.  If this movement brings you within 5 feet of the creature, or you were already within 5 feet of it, you may make a bite attack against it with advantage as part of your reaction.



### Hordemaster
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>

You’ve learned how to summon and command hordes of rats to devour your foes, granting you the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* As an action, you can summon a number of **giant rats** equal to your proficiency bonus, which appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 30 feet of you.  The summoned rats are friendly to you and your companions.  In combat, the rats share your initiative count, but they each take their turns immediately after yours in any order you choose.  
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to command any of the rats within 30 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).  You decide what action the rats will take and where they will move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular area or run up and attack a specific creature.  
If you issue no commands, they can move and use their reaction on their own, but the only action they take on their turn is the Dodge action.  Once given an order, the rats continue to follow it until their task is complete or they end their turn more than 30 feet away from you.  Each rat disappears after it drops to 0 hit points, after 10 minutes have passed, or you use this feature to summon more rats.  
Once you summon rats this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher.  When you summon rats this way, you create a number of rats equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.

### Plague Rat
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>

Your body is riddled with diseases that perversely grant you vitality while also allowing your bites to inflict debilitating infections, thus granting you the following benefits:
* Increase your Constitution or Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with your bite attack, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or become infected by your disease.  While it is diseased, whenever the infected creature makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.  The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the disease on a success.  Once a creature is cured of the disease, or it succeeds on saving throw against the disease, it can't become infected by this disease again for 24 hours.

### Tail Master
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>
You've trained your tail coordination to the point where you can use it like a third hand.  You may use your tail to perform actions you would normally need a free hand for.  Your tail can wield simple weapons with the light property, but no other types of weapons and no shields.  When you take an attack action while wielding a weapon with your tail, you may make an additional off-hand attack, allowing you a maximum of two off-hand attacks.

### Under Speaker
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>
You've learned how to communicate with your fellow rodents, keeping you well informed by a vast network of verminous spies and granting you the following benefits:


\columnbreak


* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain the ability to cast the *beast sense* and *speak with animals*, but only as rituals and only targeting rats.  The spells' spell casting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

* You can cast *animal friendship* and *animal messenger*, but only targeting rats.  Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest.  You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.  The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

### Unrivalled Killer
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>
You know how best to capitalize on any opening left by your opponent, granting you the following benefits:
* Increase your Dexterity or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You learn the *true strike* cantrip. You can cast it without somatic components, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability when casting it. You can cast this spell even while you are frightened by your Scurry Away trait. If an attack that was granted advantage by the spell hits, you can use your Overwhelming Swarm trait even if you have no uses of the feature left, and doing so does not expend any uses of it.
* When you use your Overwhelming Swarm feature against a creature that can't see you, you gain the maximum number of additional damage dice possibly granted by that feature, regardless of the number of allies within 5 feet of your target.

## New Items
The following items are exotic creations often used by the ratfolk but rarely found in use by other races. This is often because their design is so unusual or dangerous that they require specialized training to use to their full effect. Many of these weapons have a corresponding feat that players can take to help them specialize in their use.

### Blight Censers

These insidious weapons have the appearance of a ceremonial censer used for burning incense, but they are shaped into the form of a flail.  Each day, a plague censor can be filled with toxic incense, and as the censor is swung in combat, it unleashes necrotic fumes deadly to all in the vicinity, including the wielder.    


#### Blight Censer
*melee weapon (martial, flail)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d8
- **Damage Type:** Bludgeoning
- **Properties:** Heavy, two-handed, reach, special
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___

***Plague Censor.*** When you make an attack with a blight censer, it releases its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.  Each creature in that area takes 1d6 necrotic damage, including the wielder.  Once a blight censer releases its putrid incense, it can't do so again until the next round.

The blight censer must be filled every 24 hours with 10gp worth of putrid incense to maintain this trait.

#### Feat: Blight Censer Fanatic
You've learned how to develop a supernatural bond with a plague censor, drawing perverse fortitude from it even as you are withered by its toxic fumes, and you can use this bond as a focus for your magical abilities.   You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with blight censers.

*  As long as you are wielding a blight censer containing putrid incense, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and you can perform the somatic components of spells even when it is occupying both your hands.

* When you cast a spell that has somatic components using your blight censer as your spellcasting focus, you may have it release its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.

* When you release putrid incense from a blight censer you are wielding, you may have it deal 1d8 necrotic damage rather than 1d6.

* When you take necrotic damage from a blight censer you are wielding, you get +2 to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you stop wielding the plague censor in both hands.

### Toxic Wind Globes
Toxic wind globes are orbs made of glass or crystal and filled with deadly gas. When shattered, the spheres release billowing toxic clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death.


#### Toxic Wind Globes
___
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
This is the standard variant of the toxic wind globes often utilized by foot soldiers in service of ratfolk engineers.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.



#### Doom Globes
___
- **Cost:** 100 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Doom globes are built with the same function as toxic wind globes, but the gasses they carry are far more potent and capable of enveloping a much larger area.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 10-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.

#### Toxic Wind Globe & Doom Globe Upgrades

These effects can be added to toxic wind globes or doom globes to enhance their lethality. The cost of the globe is increased by 100 gold per upgrade added. If they're added to the globes used ratfolk toxic wind bombardiers or ratfolk doom globe bombardiers, their CR goes up by 1 per <br>upgrade applied to their globes.

* **Acid Blast.** When the orb shatters at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the orb's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (This orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

* **Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the orb deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

* **Hex Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the orb, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

#### New Feat: Toxic Wind Fumigator
You've become a master of crafting and utilizing toxic wind globes to maximum effect, and you can even implement globes with gases specialized in poisoning creatures normally resistant or immune to such effects. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kit, or glassblower's tools

* You may have the saving throw for a toxic wind globe or doom globe you throw become 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, and you may add your Intelligence modifier to the poison damage its gas cloud deals.

* At the end of each long rest, choose a creature type other than construct. Creatures of the chosen creature type don't benefit from resistance or immunity to poison damage from toxic wind globes and doom globes you throw unless they are under the effect of the *protection from poison* spell.

* If you are proficient with glassblowers tools and either alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kits, and you have them in hand, you can create a new toxic wind globe from the remains of one that has shattered within the last hour. To do so, you must expend 25 gp worth of alchemist's supplies or poisons over the course of 1 minute to turn the shattered globe into a new toxic wind globe.

### Spike Fists
These vicious weapons are gauntlets, bracers, or metal knuckle rings fitted with one or more metal spikes or blades. They are used by brutal warriors who specialize in setting up cheap shots and attacking opponents when they are most vulnerable.

#### Spike Fist
*melee weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d4
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** light, special
- **Cost:** 5 gp

___
***Spike Fist.***  When you hit with an attack with this weapon that had advantage, its damage increases to 2d4 piercing damage.



#### Feat: Spike Fist Brutalist
You've mastered the underhanded tactics necessary to brutalize your foes with spike fists, granting you the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with spike fists.

* Attacks you make with spike fists deal 1d6 piercing damage or 2d6 piercing damage if they have advantage.

* When you make a spike fist attack with advantage, you can forgo advantage for that roll to increase the damage you deal to 4d6 piercing damage if you hit.

### Things Catchers
This two-handed polearm has a large, tong-like head with the inside of its grips lined with spikes. The weapon is designed to be thrust around the torsos and extremities of foes to grab and painfully subdue them.

#### Things Catcher
*melee weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d4
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** reach, special, two-handed
- **Cost:** 2 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___
***Things Catcher.***  A large or smaller creature you hit with a things catcher is automatically grappled by you. Until the grapple ends, you can't attack any other targets with the things catcher. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice), freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. If a creature has multiple attacks with the Attack action, it can replace any number of them with these checks. The grapple also ends if you drop the things catcher.



#### Feat: Things Wrangler
You developed the abilities needed to wield things catchers in more versatile ways and make them more difficult to escape from, granting you the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with things catchers.

* You treat things catchers as though they have the versatile property, dealing 1d6 piercing damage with two hands and 1 piercing damage with one hand.

* You can use two-weapon fighting while wielding a things catcher as long as one of the weapons you are wielding is light.

* You may have the grapple escape DC of a things catcher you are wielding be 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

### Throwing Stars

These small, sharpened metal stars can be thrown or used as a stabbing weapon to deal small amounts of damage and potentially deliver poisoned attacks.  Their small size and unassuming nature make them ideal concealed weapons.


#### Throwing Star
*ranged weapon (simple)*
___
- **Damage:** 1
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Finesse, light, thrown(20/60), special
- **Cost:** 5 sp
- **Weight:** 1/10 lb
___

***Throwing Star.*** You can use two-weapon fighting to make off-hand attacks with throwing stars as though they are melee weapons, and you can use throwing stars to make melee weapon attacks as though they are light melee weapons. However, you still have disadvantage on these attack rolls if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and isn't incapacitated. 

#### Feat: Throwing Star Master
You mastered the art of using the normally unassuming throwing star to disrupt your foes and set up brutal follow-on attacks, granting you the following benefits:  

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with throwing stars.

* You can draw a throwing star as part of the attack you make with it.

* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using a throwing star that did not suffer from disadvantage, you can gain advantage on the next melee weapon attack or unarmed strike you make against that creature this turn.

### Hex Weapons
These highly advanced weapons blend sophisticated technology and eldritch magic to create a firearm that fires bullets brimming with radiant magical energy. The difficulty in crafting these weapons, combined with the exotic nature of their ammunition, means they are only commonly found in the possession of ratfolk engineers. Even when they do find their way into other hands, the dangerous and unreliable nature of the hex bullets they fire makes most non-ratfolk creatures weary of using such weaponry.

#### Hexmusket
*ranged weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 2d8
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Ammunition (range 150/450), reload (1), heavy, two-handed, hexbullets 
- **Cost:** 150 gp
- **Weight:** 18 lb
___


#### Hexlock Pistol
*melee weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d12
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Ammunition (range 60/120), reload (1), light, hexbullets
- **Cost:** 250 gp
- **Weight:** 18 lb
___

### New Weapon Properties 
&emsp;**Reload (X).** This weapon can be fired X times before it must be reloaded using an action or in place of an attack that's part of an attack action or in place of an off-hand attack while duel wielding. The weapon can be reloaded early without losing any ammunition.

**Hexbullets.** This weapon requires special ammunition known as hexbullets which weapons cannot use unless they have this property. Attacks using this ammunition count as magical, and on hit, their target takes additional 2d6 radiant damage. When you make an attack using hexbullets, if the result of your attack roll is 3 or less, the attack automatically misses as the weapon misfires, and you take damage as though the weapon attack has hit you.

## New Spells
The magic utilized by ratfolk typically reflects the aspects of their verminous nature they've chosen to lean into. The following spells are examples of the types of magic often utilized by ratfolk spellcasters and are divided into groups based on their theme. While these spells are most often used by ratfolk, knowledge of their use could easily fall into the hands of other races.

### Lore of Vermin
This is the most generalized category of ratfolk spells. It includes magic that draws on the ruinous nature of the ratfolk, along with their tendency to spread pestilence and decay. There are also spells that emphasize their kindship with rats and other verminous creatures and magic that can drive allies into desperate, self-destructive frenzies when they're backed into a corner.

#### Death Frenzy
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sharp tooth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You send a creature into a frenzy that pushes its body beyond its limits. Choose a willing creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, it takes 1d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and has advantage on weapon and unarmed strike attack rolls until that turn ends. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Fissure
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S,
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Druid
___

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt out from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long.  The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep.  If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure.  Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side it moves to. 

The fissure deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with it when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the length by 20 feet and its depth by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

\columnbreak





#### Rancid Visitation
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Cleric, Warlock
___

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, it takes 4d10 necrotic damage and is afflicted with a disease that lasts until the spell ends.

A creature afflicted by this disease takes 4d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of your turns and must then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. 

If a diseased creature drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can end the disease on the creature and cause it to infect a new creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it. The new creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be infected with the same disease for the remainder of the spell's duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, each time it would deal damage, it deals an additional 1d10 necrotic damage for each slot level above 4th.

#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the necrotic damage dealt to targeted creatures and creatures in the area of the cone of bile by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Summon Swarm
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded cage worth at least 300 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You call forth a swarm of tiny creatures that manifest in <br> an unoccupied space you can see within range.  This <br> swarm uses the Swarm Spirit stat block*.  When you cast <br> the spell, choose a type of creature: Bats, Insects, Rats, or Snakes.  The creatures of the swarm resemble the chosen creature, which determines some of its traits in its stat <br> block.  The swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points <br> or when the spell ends.

The swarm is an ally to you and your companions.  In combat, the swarm shares your initiative count, but it <br> takes its turn immediately after yours.  It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don’t issue <br> any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.  Additionally, increase the swarm's size by one category for every two slot levels above 3rd level.

**Stat blocks found later in document*

#### World Sore
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You cause a boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see.  The boil occupies a 5-foot sphere centered on the chosen space.  The surface where a boil appears must be wide enough to accommodate its size.

The boil has AC 10, 20 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to piercing damage.  When reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into puss, and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity save.  Creatures take 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

On each of your turns, while you are within 100 feet of the boil and can see it, you can use your bonus action to either cause the boil to explode, as described above, or grow it.  Growing it increases its radius by 5 feet, increases the damage it deals when it blows up by 1d8, and extends the range of its explosion by 5 feet.  If there is no room for the boil to expand when you attempt to grow it, which includes being blocked by a creature, it remains its current size and explodes instead.  
The boil immediately explodes when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage when the boil explodes increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

> ***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a tiny creature. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell’s level (rounded down).
> 
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4d6 or 2d6 piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

> ##### Alternative Swarms
> The names of the swarm stat blocks represent suggested descriptions for the type of animal likely to have the abilities of that stat block.  However, you're free to describe the swarms as being composed of different creatures that might have similar abilities.  For example, the swarm of bats could alternately be described as a swarm of biting locusts.

### Lore of Stealth
This flavor of ratfolk magic plays on their <br> innate skills in stealth and underhanded <br> combat tactics. It is magic favored by the <br> sorcerers of the ninja ratfolk clans as it helps <br> conceal allies while debilitating foes in insidious <br> ways. However, ninjas and assassins of other races <br> will find just as much use for these spells.

#### Black Whirlwind
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

On a successful save,  a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its darkvision.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. The spell also snuffs out any non-magical fire in its area.

 While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

Creatures immune to fear automatically succeed on this save.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell’s damage increases by one die when you reach 5th level (2d8 or 2d12), 11th level (3d8 or 3d12), and 17th level (4d8 or 4d12).

## New Magic Items
As creatures who are always looking for ways to tip the odds in their favor, ratfolk are quick to utilize a variety of magic items. The following are examples of magic items that are commonly utilized by ratfolk and less often found in the hands of other creatures. The items are divided into sections based on theme; the hex stone tokens listed below don't belong to any given theme as they are commonly used by most ratfolk.

#### Hex Stone Token 
*Wonderous item, rare, 200g*<br>
These palm-size wafers of magical minerals can be consumed to boost one's magical abilities. However, their hazardous nature means most non-ratfolk creatures aren't willing to take such a reckless risk for the extra power.


While in possession of one or more hex stone tokens, you can use an action to eat any number of tokens to regain one expended spell slot of your choice. If the expended slot level is higher than the number of tokens eaten, the new slot level is equal to the number of tokens eaten. You must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking an amount of necrotic damage based on the number of tokens eaten on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This damage and hit point maximum reduction can't be reduced or prevented in any way except by succeeding on the saving throw, and it lasts until you finish a long rest. 

The amount of necrotic damage taken and DC of the saving throw depend on the number of tokens eaten, as shown in the Hex Stone Token Table below.

##### Hex Stone Token Table 
| Number of Tokens  | Save DC |  Damage  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  | 13 | 2d6|
|  2  | 14 | 4d6|

### Ninja Ratfolk Magic Items
These items are often magical versions of ninja weaponry or items that enhance the user's ability to sneak and carry out assassination or hit-and-run attacks. They are jealously coveted by the ratfolk ninja clans and highly sought after by thieves and assassins of other races.


#### Armor of Trepidation
*Armor (light, medium, and heavy), rare*<br>
This armor holds the natural trepidation of the ratfolk that forged it.

You have a +3 bonus to AC while wearing this armor and are frightened. While wearing this armor and frightened, you may willingly move closer to the source of your fear as well.

#### Cloak of Darkness
*Wonderous item, very rare*<br>
This cloak was woven from the hair of murder victims and spider silk and allows its wearer to become undetectable in darkness.

While in darkness while wearing this cloak, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness, are hidden from divination magic, and can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.



#### Tenebrous Pedant 
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This pendant was crafted from the skull of a ratfolk shadow master and emits dark, smokey incense that can be used to cloak its wearer in inky darkness. 

The pendant has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word and expend 1 or more of its charges. When you do so, shadows begin pouring out from it for a number of minutes equal to the charges you expended or until you use another bonus action to command it to stop. While the shadows are pouring out, dim light within 10 feet of you turns into darkness, and bright light <Br> in the same area is turned into dim light. 



\columnbreak

If an area being dimed by the pendant overlaps with an area being illuminated by a spell of 1st level or higher, the pendent shuts off early.

The pendant regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk.

#### Triad Stars
*Weapon (throwing star), rare (requires attunement)*<br>
These three magical throwing stars were carved from the bones of a master assassin. You must possess all three to attune to them. While attuned to them, you can use an action to cause all three to teleport into your hand. 

Each star adds a +1 to attack rolls made with it. When you strike a target with a star, it takes an additional 1d4 piercing damage. If it has been hit by one of the other stars within the last minute, it instead takes an additional 2d4 piercing damage. If it has been hit by both of the other stars within the last minute, it instead takes an additional 3d4 piercing damage.

#### Weeping Blade 
*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*<br>

This blade constantly drips with a black acid that can eat through armor.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to deal an additional 2d6 acid damage and cover it in acid. The creature remains covered in acid until it or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. At the end of a creature’s turn, if it is covered in acid this way, it takes 2d6 acid damage, and any armor it is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.

### Ratfolk Engineer Magic Items
While ratfolk engineers invent too many devices to list, the following are some of their more well-known and widespread inventions. These items are more stable than the typical ratfolk invention but tend to be one-use items that are either more niche in their use cases or unleash chaotic and unstable effects.


#### Brass Orb
*Wondrous item, very rare, 2560gp, weight: 2 lb*<br>
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs <Br> is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear <Br> in reality.

If you are not restrained or grappled, you can use an action to hurl this item at a point you can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point which destroys it and forces each creature within 15 feet of it that’s not behind total cover to make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35 (10d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished <br> to another chaotic plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against you. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the brass orb, and it detonates at your location.

#### Gnaw Bomb
*Wonderous item, rare, 200gp, weight: 1 lb*

When this chaotic device is detonated, it releases wild arcane energy, temporarily tearing a hole in the fabric of reality.

You can use an action to throw the gnaw bomb up to 30 feet, where it detonates, creating a 5-foot diameter portal ("gnaw hole") lasting one minute. Creatures caught within this area that do not have total cover must make a DC 15 Constitution save, taking 10 (3d6) force damage on failure or half as much on a success.

A creature can enter a gnaw hole to emerge from another one that's within 120 feet. A gnaw hole requires 5 feet of movement to enter. Upon entry, the creature knows the location of all other gnaw holes within range and can exit from any of them, appearing within 5 feet of the chosen gnaw hole; otherwise, it pops back out within 5 feet of the gnaw hole it entered. A creature can only be transported to another gnaw hole this way once per round.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the gnaw bomb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against you. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the gnaw bomb, and it detonates at your location.

#### Esoteric Hex Resonator
*Wonderous item, rare, 500gp, weight: 1 lb*

This sealed orb features thirteen intricate dials and pulses with hex energy each time its dials are adjusted.

The esoteric hex resonator holds 13 charges. As an action, a creature can expend any number of the resonator's charges to recharge an equal number of expended charges on a magic item created by an Artificer Infusion. 

Artificer Infusions are described in the Infuse Item ability of the artificer class from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Oil of Explosive Speed
*Potion, 50gp, uncommon, weight: 1 lb*

This vial contains volatile eldritch oil, which can be used to momentarily enhance a vehicle with explosive speed.

When a creature uses its action to pilot a vehicle, it can inject this oil into the vehicle as part of that action, consuming the oil in the process. The vehicle's speed doubles for the turn. If the vehicle has a Mishaps Table, roll a d6 at the end of your turn. On a 6, the vehicle suffers a mishap.

#### Storm Daemon
*Halberd, rare, 4,000gp (requires attunement), weight: 9 lb*<br>

This tall, hex stone-powered halberd was crafted by the master eldritch engineers of the ratfolk. Copper wires coil around its shaft, adorned with luminous hex stone chunks. It crackles with energy, drawing power from its hex generator to unleash bolts of dark lightning.

**Eldritch Power:** If you're not incapacitated at the start of your turn, you may harness the Storm Daemon's eldritch might. To do so, roll 1d4. You gain eldritch power levels equal to the result, lasting one minute or until you invoke this feature again. Rolling a 4 causes you to take 4d8 lightning damage, which cannot be reduced by any means.

**Eldritch Strike:** When you hit a target with the halberd, you may expend your accumulated eldritch power levels to deal an extra 1d10 lightning damage per level expended.

**Ranged Spell Attack:** The halberd can be used to make ranged spell attacks with a range of 100/400 ft. Add your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, you expend all your eldritch power levels to deal 1d10 lightning damage per level expended, plus your Intelligence modifier.

# Two-Creature Weapons Teams
Some weapons are so massive they require two creatures to move and operate them effectively. These weapons may be oversized firearms, large incendiary devices, or unwieldy melee weapons such as large drills. Though they come in many forms, they have a few common traits: they require two creatures to operate, they can be moved without hindrance by two creatures, and they must be loaded with some form of fuel and ammunition on a regular basis to be fired.

## Two-Creature Weapon Rules
Two-creature weapons require at least two creatures to operate them, and they come with the following additional rules considerations:


### The Weapons Team
The two creatures operating a two-creature weapon are known as the weapons team. The weapons team consists of a leader and a follower. Only one creature can be assigned to each role, and they cannot switch roles once assigned, even if one of the roles becomes vacant, unless they leave the weapons team and rejoin.

#### Joining a Weapons Team

Joining a two-creature weapons team costs a creature's action and half of its movement as it equips its part of the weapon. If one creature is already part of the weapons team, it may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature joining the team. Leaving a weapon team requires no action as the creature drops its part of the weapon.

A creature must have both hands available to be on a weapons team and can't pick anything else up without dropping its part of the weapon.

The creatures within a weapons team must stay within 5 feet of each other and the weapon at all times. If one of them is ever more than 5 feet away from the weapon or the other team member, it is no longer part of the team. 

#### Moving Two-Creature Weapons
The follower can no longer move on its turn except to leave the weapons team. The leader's speed becomes equal to the lowest speed among the creatures on the weapons team. Whenever the leader moves, it can choose to move the follower along with it if the follower is willing, even when the leader is moved against its will. 

#### Stealth
While part of a weapons team, a creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, activating a two-creature weapon reveals the weapons team's location if they are hidden.



### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

## Two-Creature <br> Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning two-creature weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, weapons can have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by creatures on their weapons teams. The Load and Crank functions <br> can be activated by the follower, and the Fire <br> function can be activated by the leader. Each <br> function can only be activated once per round. 

#### Load
This function is used by the follower to reload <br> the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. <br> It requires the follower to have immediate <br> access to the weapon's ammunition, and <br> creatures can use their reaction to make <br> opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits <br> the follower this way, it drops the ammo and <br> wastes its action.

#### Crank
Not all weapons have this function. If a weapon <br> does, it must be activated by the follower before <br> each use of the Fire function to move the ammo <br> or fuel through the weapon.

#### Fire
The function is activated by the leader to fire the <br> weapon. When this function is activated, but before <br> its effect occurs, roll to see if a Mishap occurs.

\columnbreak



 If a Mishap occurs, its effects happen before the effects of the Fire. This function can't be used if the weapon is out of ammo or if the weapon has a Crank function that hasn't been used since the weapon was last loaded or fired.

### Mishaps
Mishaps represent the weapon experiencing a significant malfunction. There is always a risk of this when firing the weapon, and some weapons have other circumstances that risk a mishap. Whenever this risk occurs, roll a d6. On a result of 1, a Mishap occurs, and the creature who triggered it must roll on the weapon's Mishap Table to determine the nature of this malfunction (see the Mishap Table section).

If the weapon has less than half its hit points, roll 2d6 and take the lowest result when checking for a mishap. 

Unless stated otherwise, you must always check for a mishap when activating the Fire function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Most weapons have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways their functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishap Table.

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Ratfolk Two-Creature Weapons
Though two-creature weapons teams are deployed by many races with the technological know-how to craft such weapons, ratfolk are among the most prolific users of such weaponry. This may be due to the combination of their technical capabilities, their willingness to take on the risks such weapons pose, and the seemingly never-ending amount of weapons designs their mad engineers concoct. Though these weapons can be hazardous to their users, ratfolk are never shy about accepting such risks if it means getting the opportunity to obliterate foes with overwhelming firepower. 

The ever-opportunistic ratfolk often mass-produce their most popular designs and sell their inventions to the highest bidder. They will often make more potent versions of these weapons as well. These masterwork variations gain sinister nicknames as their dreaded reputation builds, and they are reserved for use by the most prestigious clients of the ratfolk engineers.


### Toxic Wind Mortars
This fiendish artillery piece is an amalgamation of primitive engineering and unholy alchemy, a stark representation of the Ratfolk's cunning adaptability. Crudely crafted from rusting iron and scavenged metals, its appearance belies the terror it inflicts. It's not merely the brutish launch mechanism of a traditional mortar that warrants fear, but the horrific payload it delivers.

At the heart of this weapon lies the toxic wind - a deadly concoction of the most lethal substances the Ratfolk have extracted from their underworld environment, or synthesized through their arcane and toxic alchemy. Sealed within fragile orbs of glass, this gas waits with malevolent potential for release.

When the toxic wind mortar fires, these spheres arc high through the air, shattering on impact and spreading their malignant payload: a green, ethereal miasma that sickens, corrodes, and eventually kills those who inhale it. Armor tarnishes and rots, flesh sears and boils, and the very life-force is choked out of those caught within the cloud. The sight of this deathly fog approaching not only brings physical destruction but also instills terror, often breaking the morale of the enemy before the cloud even reaches them.

#### Toxic Wind Mortar Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a toxic wind mortar. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Acid Blast.** When the weapon's ammo shatter at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the weapon's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (The orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

**Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the weapon's ammo deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

**Hex Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the weapon's ammo, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

#### Toxic Wind Mortar Tactics
Toxic wind mortars function as artillery and excel in providing area denial and obscuring the enemies' vision. This tactic proves highly effective when ratfolk forces need to reposition, surprise their enemies, blind opposing ranged attackers, or force them to move. Due to the delicate nature of their ammunition, Toxic wind mortar teams will use their Scurry Away feature to quickly escape whenever an enemy approaches melee range. 

The upgrades for toxic wind mortars don't alter their tactics but instead enhance their effectiveness in their existing roles.

### Ratlinn Guns
A paradoxical fusion of crude engineering and subtle brilliance, the ratlinn gun is a testament to the ratfolk's knack for invention. Built from scavenged metals, timeworn wood, and the odd mysterious alloys they mine from the depths, this rapid-fire weapon is a sight to behold. It is composed of multiple rotating barrels, each capable of spitting out a hail of deadly ammunition at a terrifying rate.

The ammunition is unique to the ratfolk, handcrafted in the underbelly of their world. A mixture of sharp metal shards, stolen and scavenged munitions, and occasional nuggets of strange underworld minerals, all are melted down and recast into thousands of wicked, serrated projectiles.

When activated, the ratlinn gun roars to life, its barrels spinning in a lethal whirl. In seconds, it can transform a tranquil landscape into a storm of flying metal, shredding through ranks of foes like a scythe through wheat. The very sight and sound of the ratlinn gun is enough to break the morale of many a foe, a rapid, deafening symbol of the ratfolk's ferocity.


Yet, the ratlinn gun is not without its flaws. It is a volatile and unpredictable weapon. Overheating is common, leading to disastrous explosions that harm friend and foe alike. The ammunition, while plentiful, is inconsistent, causing unpredictable trajectories and often requiring a significant volume of fire to be effective.

#### Ratlinn Gun Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a ratlinn gun. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Ratlinn Coolant.** When rolling to check for a mishap with the weapon, you can choose to disregard one of the d6s you roll (if you're only rolling 1d6, you can negate the need to roll.) If the weapon incurs damage that reduces its hit points to half or less, or if a mishap occurs, the coolant bursts. The burst coolant forces each creature within a 10-foot radius of the weapon to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, suffering 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. The coolant burst is resolved prior to any Mishaps that triggered this event. Once the coolant bursts, the weapon loses this ability until it fully regains its hit points.

**Hemorrhaging Shots.** Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire function, it sustains a wound. At the end of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage per wound. A creature can have multiple wounds simultaneously. Wounds can be healed if the creature regains 10 or more hit points, or if a use of a healer's kit is expended on it. Alternatively, the wounded creature or another creature within 5 feet can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check check against the weapon's DC as an action, ending all wounds on a success.

**On-Board Ammo Assembler.** When the follower is using the weapon's Load function, they can choose to salvage parts from an unmanned two-creature weapon or vehicle with a CR of 3 or higher within 5 feet, provided it has at least 30 hit points. Doing so inflicts 30 damage to the salvaged weapon or vehicle. If this reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is dismantled and cannot be used for further salvaging. The follower gains a special ammo belt made from the salvaged parts that lasts for one minute. While using this ammo, the weapon deals an additional 13 (2d12) damage with its Fire function, but the function triggers a Mishap on a roll of 1 or 2 when using this ammo.

#### Ratlinn Gun Tactics
The ratlinn gun represents the epitome of risk-reward weaponry, with its potential to eliminate virtually any target, be it swarms of enemies or a single formidable creature. Its primary targets are foes with heavy armor and low dexterity.

As long as the fight is progressing favorably, weapons teams typically start by firing two rounds per turn. However, when victory is within grasp or defeat is imminent, the rate of fire escalates. In extreme panic or power-driven frenzy, teams fire as many rounds as possible.

##### Ratlinn Gun Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Ratlinn Coolant.** This safety upgrade gives weapons teams the confidence to fire three shots per turn instead of the usual two, as long as the coolant is active.

**Hemorrhaging Shots.** With this upgrade, the team is more likely to distribute their shots across multiple targets to inflict bleeding. If there's a creature effectively healing the wounds, they will focus their fire on that target, often risking more rounds per turn to eliminate it.

**On-Board Ammo Assembler.** Encounters involving multiple ratlinn guns with this upgrade can be interesting. The guns are encouraged to be more reckless, firing more shots per turn. If one of the guns experiences a malfunction, the team abandons it, and the remaining ratlinn gun teams cannibalize its parts. The increased mishap rate from the newly acquired scrap bullets means they can deliver devastating damage but with higher misfire risks. When the weapons misfire and become disabled, they contribute more scrap for the remaining ratlinn guns.

### Hexfire Throwers

Constructed from rusted metal, corroded pipes, and bizarrely vibrant crystals mined from the deep earth, the hexfire thrower is as terrifying as it is crude. It is a deceptively simple device, consisting of a large, cumbersome tank filled with a mysterious, volatile substance, connected to a projecting nozzle manipulated by its ratfolk wielder.

This enigmatic liquid, known only as "hexfire", is a product of the ratfolk's arcane knowledge and alchemical prowess. Glowing with an eerie, otherworldly light, it is said to be the physical manifestation of raw, chaotic energy harnessed and condensed. When unleashed, the hexfire clings to anything it touches, searing and consuming it with unnatural, green flames.

When the hexfire thrower is fired, a torrent of this deadly hexfire is expelled, engulfing everything in its path. The very air seems to hex and ripple around it, and the heat it generates is so intense it can melt through steel and stone alike. The sight of this horrifying green firestorm is often enough to break the will of even the most hardened warriors.

However, the hexfire thrower is a perilous weapon, even to its handlers. The hexfire is highly volatile and unpredictable, and any misstep, any fault in the device, can result in catastrophic backlashes. It's not uncommon for the thrower to explode in a ball of hexfire, consuming the ratfolk operator and those unfortunate enough to be nearby.

#### Hexfire Thrower Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a hexfire thrower. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Self-Destruct Mechanism.** The team follower may use their bonus action to activate the weapon's self-destruction sequence. At the end of that creature's next turn, the weapon is destroyed in an explosion, and every creature within 30 feet of it is subjected to the weapon's Fire function.

**Motorized Pumps.** Each time the hexfire thrower is cranked, it gains a level of heat that lasts until the weapon goes one full round without being cranked. If the safety protocol is overridden, the hexfire thrower gains two levels of heat. The hexfire thrower's Fire function deals an additional 4 (1d8) fire damage for each level of heat, and when checking for a mishap, a mishap occurs if the number rolled on a d6 is equal to or less than the current heat level.

**Hex Napalm.** If a creature or a flammable object fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire function, it ignites. Until an action is taken to douse the fire, the target suffers 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

\columnbreak

#### Hexfire Thrower Tactics
Hexfire throwers are designed to target the largest clustered group of enemies during a battle, but they always maintain a safe distance of at least 5 feet from any opponents. The weapons team will override its safety protocol whenever doing so allows them to hit two or more additional enemies. This strategy is also employed in moments of panic or when the team feels they have the upper hand.

##### Hexfire Thrower Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Self-Destruct Mechanism.** This upgrade perfectly aligns with ratfolk tactics. Whenever the situation becomes even slightly precarious, the team will activate the self-destruct mechanism and immediately abandon their post to avoid the ensuing explosion.

**Motorized Pumps.**  As the heat builds up and becomes unstoppable, the weapon becomes incredibly dangerous. Consequently, the ratfolk operating this weapon tend to be more reckless than other teams.

**Hex Napalm.** his weapon is best suited for a hit-and-run strategy. Ratfolk are more likely to utilize their Scurry Away feature with this weapon, forcing creatures that have failed their saving throws to decide between extinguishing the flames or using their Dash actions to chase after the weapons team. The team should prioritize setting as many creatures ablaze as possible rather than focusing on one particular group.

### Hex Grinders
Fashioned from an eerie blend of scavenged metals, ancient stone, and uncanny, glowing crystals found only in the deepest crevices of the underworld, the hex grinder stands as a testament to the ratfolk's dark intellect. It consists of a pair of interlocked, spiral-shaped drills, powered by the raw, volatile energy housed within the strange crystals.

These drills, when activated, spin at tremendous speed, tearing through rock, metal, and even magic-enhanced barriers with alarming ease. They produce a chilling, grinding noise that haunts the tunnels, a sound as unnerving as the sight of the green, flickering energy that arcs around the device's tips. When put into overdrive, the device is capable of tearing apart huge swaths of earth and foes alike with the thunderous roar of its whirring drill.

The hex grinder's primary function is that of an unhindered excavator. With its pair of interlocked, spiraling drills spinning at astonishing speed, the device can burrow through the toughest of materials with ease. This ability is exploited by the ratfolk to quickly create new tunnels and pathways in the underground labyrinth they call home. Using the hex grinder, they can swiftly approach their unsuspecting enemies from unexpected directions, launching devastating ambushes that often turn the tide of battle in their favor.

In the realm of siege warfare, the hex grinder is equally menacing. It can quickly undermine defensive walls, chew through gatehouses, and reduce towers to rubble, making short work of even the most formidable fortifications. When faced with a barrier, whether physical or magical, the ratfolk operators merely rev up the hex grinder and let it do its terrifying work. In a matter of moments, once impregnable defenses crumble, sowing chaos among the defenders and paving the way for the ratfolk's vicious onslaught.

#### Hex Grinder Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a hex grinder. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.


**Seismic Snare.** When a creature fails the saving throw against the weapon's Fire function and is standing on earth or stone, it becomes buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature is restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a Strength check against the weapon's DC. This check has advantage if the creature making it has a burrow speed.

**Emboldening Fumes.** When the Fire function is used, each creature that is part of the weapons team gains 10 temporary hit points at the end of the turn. While a creature has these temporary hit points, it is poisoned and immune to being frightened or charmed. A creature immune to the poisoned condition cannot gain these temporary hit points. If the weapon's safety protocol has been overridden, the team gains 20 temporary hit points instead. If the weapon has a Mishap, they gain 30 temporary hit points instead.

**Hex-Quake.** Whenever a creature fails its saving throw against the weapon's Fire function while standing on difficult terrain created by any hex-grinder within the last minute, it takes an extra 13(2d12) plus 9(2d8) thunder damage.

#### Hex Grinder Tactics

The hex grinder weapons teams expertly lead ratfolk in subterranean ambushes and serve as formidable shock troopers.

The hex grinder should be part of preplanned ambush teams, bursting from the ground to surprise enemies. However, the emergence point might be slightly random due to the difficulty of pinpoint precision during emergence. Note that the tunnels may require Medium creatures to squeeze through for traversal, except for ratfolk, who can easily navigate them with their Crevice Crawler feature.


\columnbreak

To determine if the hex grinder surprises enemies, have the weapons team carrying it perform Stealth checks. The team should override the safety protocol to move at maximum speed just before reaching the surface, preventing enemies from preparing for battle if they notice the incoming attack.

Upon surfacing, the team targets the nearest high-armor and low-dexterity enemy with the weapons Fire ability. If they can hit multiple targets without causing too much harm to friendly forces, they will override the safety protocol and use the area-of-effect version of the Fire ability. This will provide advantage to attacking allies if the targets are knocked prone. The difficult terrain created by this ability can also facilitate escape or hinder enemy reinforcements.

The burrowing ability remains useful even after surfacing. It allows the weapons team to move through the difficult terrain they create, avoid movement penalties, dig underground to dodge ranged attacks, and escape against Medium-sized creatures more easily.

##### Hex Grinder Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Seismic Snare.** This upgrade enhances the hex grinder's debuffing capability, making it an excellent choice when teaming up with groups of ratfolk.

**Emboldening Fumes.** This upgrade empowers the hex grinder to be far more daring. Those affected by the fumes will never flee from battle.

**Hex-Quake.** This upgrade turns the team into masters of area denial. The safety protocol should be overridden whenever this feature is used. If there are no targets on difficult terrain, the team should spend its turn spreading as much difficult terrain as possible.

### Hexlock Jezzails
Crafted from a crude amalgamation of scavenged metal, timeworn wood, and luminescent crystals of chaotic energy mined from the deepest corners of the underworld, the hexlock jezzail is a weapon of chilling potency. It is an exceptionally long, large-bore firearm, reinforced with metal bands and an elaborate shielding mechanism for the operator.

The ammunition it fires is nothing short of terrifying. Each bullet is a small shard of the same eerie crystal that powers the hexlock jezzail, carrying a piece of raw, volatile energy within. When fired, these bullets blaze a path through the air, leaving an eerie, glowing trail before they impact with devastating force, capable of penetrating the thickest armor.

With its range and power, the hexlock jezzail is an unmatched weapon of assassination and long-range warfare. The ratfolk snipers, perched high atop their subterranean cliffs or hidden in the labyrinthine tunnels, can lay low powerful adversaries from an immense distance, their presence often only revealed by the greenish streak of a successful kill.

However, the hexlock jezzail is as dangerous to its operator as it is to its targets. The raw energy within the ammunition and the firearm itself is volatile and unstable. A jammed bullet, a malfunctioning firing mechanism, or simply overuse can lead to disastrous explosions, often fatally wounding the wielder and those around them.

#### Hexlock Jezzail Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a hexlock jezzail. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Rat-Eye Scopes.** At the end of the team leader's turn, if they have not moved, they can choose to take aim at a creature within 400 feet that they can see. The leader maintains its aim at the target until the leader moves, or the leader can no longer see the target, or the target moves more than 400 feet away from the team leader. While the leader maintains this aim, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against the weapon's Fire function.

**Sniper Jezzail.** A creature doesn't have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while part of the weapons team, and creatures on the weapons team can traverse or halt in a space large enough to accommodate an object one size smaller than themselves without squeezing. Additionally, using the weapon doesn't reveal the weapons team's position to other creatures they are more than 30 feet away from.

**Embedding Rounds.** When a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire ability, the bullet embeds in the target for one minute. While embedded, the creature cannot regain hit points, and at the end of each of its turns, it takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage. The target creature or another creature within 5 feet can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check, attempting to extract the bullet. The target creature has disadvantage on this check if it attempts to remove the bullet from itself. On a successful check, the bullet is removed; however, on a failed check, the creature suffers 10 (3d6) radiant damage.

#### Hexlock Jezzail Tactics
These weapons teams serve as snipers and prioritize targeting enemies with high armor and low dexterity. They swiftly retreat when confronted in melee combat.

#### Hexlock Jezzail Upgrade Tactics 
&emsp;**Rat-Eye Scopes.** This upgrade enhances the hexlock jezzail's sniping capabilities. The weapons team must be defended by other creatures to make effective use of this upgrade. If the team isn't near death, their weapon remains operational, and their target is still within range and appears vulnerable, they will continue firing despite sources of disadvantage. 

**Sniper Jezzail.** This upgrade allows the hexlock jezzail to carry out ambushes in places where other weapons can't. If the team uses the Scurry Away feature, they'll take their time to run until they can become hidden again before resuming fire.

**Embedding Rounds.** While the team will still prioritize hitting low-dexterity targets, with this upgrade, they will focus on isolated targets that are unable to receive assistance in removing the bullets.

### Two-Creature Weapon Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these weapons are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Two-Creature Weapon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

The Basic Weapon Loot Table should be used for the standard version of any of the two-creature weapons in this document. The Advanced Weapon Table should be used for the more powerful variant of any of the weapons.

##### Basic Weapon Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Hex Lightning Cannons
The hex lightning wannon is a massive, wheeled contraption that bristles with crackling energy. Constructed from a combination of scavenged metal and mysterious components, the cannons are powered by a rare and volatile energy source harnessed from the raw forces of chaos. Ratfolk engineers channel this energy into the cannon's twisted mechanisms, preparing it to unleash its devastating power.

When activated, the hex lightning cannon fires lethal bolts of crackling, coruscating energy. These electrifying projectiles surge forth, capable of piercing through the toughest armor and obliterating enemy formations with explosive force. The destructive potential of the hex lightning cannon is unmatched, making it a prized asset in the ratfolk's arsenal of war machines.

However, its power is not easily controlled, and hex lightning cannons are as dangerous to their operators as they are to their enemies. The unleashed energy often surges uncontrollably, causing catastrophic feedback that can result in explosions or the cannon tearing itself apart. Only the most skilled and daring ratfolk engineers dare to operate these deadly devices, often as a testament to their ambition and thirst for power.

The ratfolk clans jealously guard the secrets of creating and operating hex lightning cannons, considering them a potent symbol of their supremacy and a means to assert dominance over their rivals. Despite the best efforts of the ratfolk, hex lightning cannons do occasionally fall into the hands of their rivals, who are quick to modify them for their own uses in war. When brought to bear on the battlefield, the eerie glow of the cannon's energy casts a chilling pall over friend and foe alike, foretelling the chaos and destruction to come.

### Hex Lightning Cannon Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a hex lightning cannon. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

* **Hex Conduit.** When a creature makes a saving throw against the cannon's Fire function due to being in the area of its lightning, all other creatures within 5 feet of that creature must also make the saving throw against the effect as the electricity arcs between them. This arcing causes the original creature, and everyone the lightning arced to, to suffer disadvantage on their saving throws.
* **Regenerating Radiation.** When a creature preps or loads the cannon, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, it gains a level of exhaustion and regains 15 hit points. A creature immune to exhaustion cannot gain hit points this way.
* **Hex Stone Dynamos.** The cannon no longer experiences mishaps when rolling for the length of its lightning blast. Instead, when the cannon rolls for the length of the line, it gains a charge for each 4 rolled on a d4 that lasts one minute. The cannon deals an additional 4 (1d8) damage per charge it has. However, if the weapon ever gains 4 or more charges, it suffers the Energy Overload Mishap. This mishap causes the cannon to take 71 (8d8) + 35 lightning damage and lose all its charges. If reduced to 0 hit points this way, the cannon experiences the Meltdown mishap.

### Hex Lightning Cannon Tactics

The hex lightning cannon serves as a powerful piece of artillery. Unlike many other artillery pieces, it fires in a straight line, which means that allied troops in front of it must clear a path for its lightning blast. Alternatively, the crew can choose to fire through expendable allies to reach prime enemy targets. Bogging down foes in such allies can be an effective way to ensure they can't escape the cannon's blasts.

#### Hex Lightning Cannon Upgrade Tactics

**Hex Conduit.** This upgrade is particularly useful when there are many expendable units on the front line. These additional bodies can be utilized to impose disadvantage on enemies' saving throws by triggering the arcing lightning effect.

**Regenerating Radiation.** This upgrade works best with expendable, less capable creatures working the cannon, as it keeps them alive but limits their combat effectiveness. However, its usefulness diminishes when the crew is more proficient in combat, as engaging with foes directly can be used as a last resort if the cannon becomes inoperable for some reason.

**Hex Stone Dynamos.** This upgrade turns the weapon into a truly chaotic device. The predictability of its operations can be drastically reduced, leading to unforeseen outcomes on the battlefield.

# Self-Propelled Vehicles
Most land vehicles in fantasy settings are pulled by other creatures, such as wagons, carriages, or chariots. However, through some combination of technology or magic, some vehicles may be self-propelled and driven by a passenger. These may be relatively small mechanical contraptions, magically self-propelled carriages, or mighty war machines rumbling across blasted battlefields. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these vehicle types in your games. They can be applied to vehicles of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own vehicles. The rules here can be applied to most self-powered vehicles piloted by a passenger. 

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Rules
Self-propelled vehicles are vehicles able to move without needing to be pushed or pulled by another creature, and they usually don’t need an external energy source (such as wind). Throughout this document, they will be referred to simply as vehicles. Creatures within a vehicle are referred to as passengers. 
In combat, vehicles use most of the same rules as creatures, with the following additional considerations:

### Opportunity Attacks
Vehicles provoke opportunity attacks as usual. When a vehicle provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle itself or any creature riding on or inside it, provided they are within reach and do not have total cover.



\columnbreak

### Spacing Within Vehicles
All creatures within a vehicle count as being within 5 feet of each other.


### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Entering or exiting the vehicle costs a creature half of its movement. Each creature inside the vehicle may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting.


### Crashing into Creatures and Objects
A vehicle can crash into a creature or object by entering its space. When it does, the creature or object must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice) using the vehicle's DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved in a straight line before attempting to enter the target's space (maximum 20d6 damage).

If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage and is not knocked prone. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the vehicle's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. A target can only make this saving throw once per turn.

If the vehicle is at least two size categories larger than the target it crashed into, it can continue moving through the target's space if it has any movement remaining. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop. If the target is an impassable object that could reasonably damage the vehicle, such as an iron wall, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6 damage). Each creature on or inside the vehicle takes the damage as well

\pagebreakNum

### Prone Vehicles
If vehicle falls prone, it cannot right itself and is incapacitated until it is flipped upright.

### Falling Vehicles
When a vehicle falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position. If the vehicle falls due to the actions of its driver (such as jumping off a ramp) it may not land prone (DM’s discretion) but still takes fall damage.



### Repairing Vehicles
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
Certain circumstances can cause a vehicle to malfunction and eventually break down due to wear and tear. This wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion rules, as described in Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with the following modifications:

* When a vehicle reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
* The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a vehicle is through repair. This can be done using the <br> rules described in the Repairing Vehicles section <br> above. If the attempt to repair the vehicle <br> succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level <br> decreases by 1. If the check fails, the <br> vehicle's exhaustion level remains <br> unchanged, but the repair attempt <br> can be made again using <br> the same tools and <br> replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these vehicles have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A vehicle's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a vehicle's hit points reach 0, it becomes inoperative and is irreparably damaged.
### Damage Threshold
Most vehicles possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A vehicle with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the vehicle takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the vehicle's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the vehicle's hit points.

### Mishap Threshold
When a vehicle sustains damage from a single source that is equal to or exceeds its mishap threshold, it is required to roll on the Mishaps table (refer to the Mishaps section).

\pagebreakNum

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the vehicle comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the vehicle.

### Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity indicates the maximum weight of cargo the vehicle can carry.

### Vehicle DC 
Whenever the vehicle requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ability Scores 
A vehicle possesses the standard six ability scores that creatures have, along with their corresponding modifiers. The Strength of the vehicle is determined by its size and weight, while Dexterity represents its handling and maneuverability. The Constitution of a vehicle reflects its durability and quality of construction. In most cases, vehicles have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a vehicle has a score of 0 in a particular ability score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that relies on that score.

### Action Stations
A vehicle may have one or more Action Stations. Each of these stations requires a certain number of creatures to operate and may grant those creatures some amount of cover. The creatures operating these stations must be passengers within the vehicle, but not all passengers need to be operating a station. A creature operating a station <br> can use an action to activate the station's effect.  <br> A station can be occupied by only one <br> creature at a time and can only <br> be activated once per round. 

\columnbreak

#### The Helm 
Most vehicles that must be piloted by a passenger (referred to as the driver) have an Action Station known as the Helm, where the vehicle's movement is controlled. It usually consists of a chair equipped with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. If a vehicle has a helm with no one operating it, it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver who is proficient with land vehicles can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

The driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring it to a complete stop. While the vehicle is in motion, the driver can steer it along any desired course. If the driver becomes incapacitated, leaves the helm, or takes no action to alter the vehicle's course and speed, the vehicle will continue moving in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it collides with an obstacle large enough to stop its movement.


### Mishaps
Most vehicles have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways its functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishaps Table. 

To resolve a Mishap, a creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (refer to the Mishaps section). If the vehicle is moving, the check is made with disadvantage. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for the repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Doom Shredders
The doom shredders are imposing contraptions, reminiscent of giant, twisted cogs that screech and grind as they surge forward. Propelled by their spinning wheels, the vehicles possess incredible speed, allowing them to swiftly close in on their foes, leaving chaos and destruction in their wake.

Mounted on each doom shredder is a skilled ratfolk driver, operating the complex controls and piloting the vehicle with unmatched precision. The doom shredders are often deployed in the vanguard of ratfolk armies, charging into enemy lines with ruthless efficiency. 



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br>

Armed with gnashing blades and deadly weapons, they eagerly carve a path through enemy ranks, dismembering all who dare stand in their way.

However, despite their formidable strength, the doom shredders are not without their risks. The unstable combination of engineering and sorcery makes them unpredictable, and accidents or malfunctions can result in catastrophic consequences, claiming the lives of both their operators and enemies alike.

##### Doom Shredder Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Tunnel Raiders:** A ratfolk clan has begun deploying doom shredder riders to terrorize underground settlements, raid them for supplies, and weaken their defenses in preparation for larger attacks. The vehicles surge through the tunnels, leaving destruction in their wake. The adventurers have been hired to put a stop to this menace.|
|  2  |**Death Derby:** A powerful and eccentric artificer has issued a challenge to ratfolk engineers and sorcerers from all clans, inviting them to participate in a deadly race where they must pilot doom shredders to claim a legendary prize. The adventurers are drawn into this competition, facing off against other participants in a perilous race through treacherous tunnels and ruins. |
|  3 | **Blades For Sale:** A ratfolk engineer living in a scrapyard has started piecing together hex flayers and selling them to criminal gangs. The adventurers are tasked with finding where these deadly vehicles are coming from and putting a stop to their distribution.|
|  4  |**The Vermin Riders:** A gang of doom shredder riding ratfolk led by a eldritch engineer is raiding the countryside, constantly looking for fuel and upgrades for their deadly vehicles. The players are tasked with tracking them down and putting a stop to their rampage. |


### Doom Shredder Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a doom shredder. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Armour-Shredding Blades.** When a creature is rammed by the doom shredder and fails the saving throw against the effect, any armor the creature is wearing is damaged and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. A creature can remove the -1 penalty from the armor over an hour if it has the appropriate tools and proficiency with them (blacksmith tools or leatherworker's tools, depending on the armor).

**Black Hole Reactor.** A crew member at the doom shredder's helm can use their action to activate its Black Hole Reactor. If they do so, they can use half of their movement to immediately exit the doom shredder, allowing the doom shredder to move in a straight line up to its movement speed after they do so. At the start of the creature's next turn, the doom shredder is destroyed, and each creature within 15 feet must make a DC Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, creatures take 9 (2d8) force damage for every 10 feet the doom shredder moved in a straight line during the last round. If this damage reduces the target to 20 hit points or fewer and they failed the saving throw, they are banished to another plane of existence at the DM's choice.

**Repelling Knife-Blades.** At the end of a crew member's turn, if the doom shredder moved 20 feet or more that turn, ranged attacks against the doom shredder and its crew have disadvantage until the end of that crew member's next turn.



\pagebreakNum

### Doom Shredder Tactics

Doom shredders function as hard-hitting chariots for ratfolk armies, lingering along enemy flanks until they identify a vulnerable target, then charging in to slice up their victims. Their ratfolk drivers typically use the Scurry Away trait to avoid counterattacks, driving to a safe distance before returning for another charge.

#### Doom Shredder Upgrade Tactics

&emsp;**Armour-Shredding Blades.** Pilots of doom shredders with this upgrade will specifically target armored enemies.

**Black Hole Reactor.** If the battle isn't going in the ratfolk's favor, it can activate the Black Hole Reactor as a last-ditch gambit. Note that even on the turn the ratfolk abandons the vehicle, the unmanned vehicle can still be used to crash into a target as it drives in a straight line toward its destination before detonating.

**Repelling Knife-Blades.** With this upgrade, the doom shredder's driver no longer needs to fear the repercussions of entering within range of heavy ranged fire. This makes the doom shredder perfect for harassing enemies with such attacks.

### Doom Shredder Weapon Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from this vehicle are materials salvaged from its remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Two-Creature Weapon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

The Basic Weapon Loot Table should be used for the standard version of any of the two-creature weapons in this document. The Advanced Weapon Table should be used for the more powerful variant of any of the weapons.

## Vermin Wheels

In the sprawling laboratories of the ratfolk, technological and magical prowess intertwine in frenetic chaos. Amidst this interplay, one invention stands as a testament to the insanity and genius of the ratfolk engineers - the vermin wheel.

The vermin wheel is an immense vehicle that looms over the battlefield like a nightmarish mockery of a rat wheel, a testament to the raw and unbridled power the ratfolk engineers can command. An engineer, picked from the most daring (or unhinged) of their kind, steers the vermin wheel from a pilot seat within, guiding this deadly contraption with mad glee, careening wildly across the landscape.

The vermin wheel’s motion is powered by an army of irradiated rats, feverishly running in unison along the inside of its massive. Dangerous arcane stones built into the machine mutate and transform these rats into tireless, monstrous variants of their kin, their muscles bulging with unnatural strength and their eyes glowing an eerie green. The ceaseless running of these mutant rats drives the huge wheel, causing it to spin with a relentless, unstoppable momentum.

But the arcane stones serve a dual purpose. As the wheel spins, it generates a kind of eldritch energy, harnessed by the embedded stone. The magical mineral, imbued with the raw force of movement, channels this power into devastating blasts of arcane lightning. This energy is unleashed upon the ratfolk’s enemies in brilliant, lethal arcs, turning the vermin wheel into a rolling generator of destructive force.

### Hex Flame Wheel

Instead of generating devastating arcs of lightning, this vermin wheel variant channels its eldritch energy into an infernal pyrotechnic display. At the heart of the wheel, an eldritch furnace glows with an unholy intensity. Fueled by the sheer kinetic force of the running rats, the furnace channels its blazing wrath into gouts of horrifying, green-tinged flame that consumes all in its path. This fire, hotter and more potent than any natural flame, reduces enemies to ash and the battlefield to a scorched wasteland.

However, the hex flame wheel's destructive potential doesn't end there, for it is equipped with a high-pressure sprayer loaded with a sticky, highly flammable oil. At the pilot's command, this oil can be sprayed over adversaries or across the battlefield. Then, with a malicious grin, the engineer ignites the oil-soaked area with the eldritch fire, turning it into a nightmarish sea of flame.

### Wheel of Kill-Doom

When the mad ratfolk engineers set their minds to outdo themselves, they do so with a level of fanaticism that defies comprehension. Born of such fervor is the pinnacle of their insane genius, a terrifying machine imbued with unstable destructive power: The Wheel of Kill-Doom.

The Wheel of Kill-Doom represents the zenith of ratfolk engineering prowess, an evolved vermin wheel that is the ultimate fusion of the most potent arcane technology and the highest-grade parts scavenged, stolen, or "ingeniously acquired” by ratfolk. The structure of the Wheel of Kill-Doom is reinforced with arcane steel designed to make it hardier and amplify the machine’s unnatural power.

Every nook and cranny of this monolithic machine boasts meticulous attention to detail, from the titanium-bolted joints to the arcane-etched gears. In a significant upgrade from the original vermin wheel, the Wheel of Kill-Doom is equipped with additional lightning generators. These devices, powered by the relentless running of the strongest irradiated rats, generate lightning of a potency unseen in its predecessor. This energy coalesces into brilliant, crackling bolts that can arc between multiple foes, leaving a trail of charred bodies and scorched earth. The spectacle of the Wheel of Kill-Doom in action is nothing short of a storm let loose on the battlefield.

##### Doomwheel Adventure Hooks
| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Abandoned Wheel:** There are rumors of an abandoned vermin wheel lying dormant in a desolate battlefield filled with rare eldritch materials. However, it is not as abandoned as it seems. Irradiated rats have mutated into monstrous forms and infested the wheel, with the largest of their number now piloting it across the rotting wasteland.|
|  2  |**Doomwheel Heist**: A wealthy collector wants a vermin wheel for his private collection and will pay the adventurers a fortune to procure one from the ratfolk. The party must concoct a plan to steal a vermin wheel from the ratfolk and pilot it to safety. |
|  3  | **The Wheel of Misfortune:** Rumors circulate of a new type of ratfolk vermin wheel, known as the hex flame wheel. Reports of devastated villages, burnt fields, and terrified survivors have reached the party, and they are hired to find the ratfolk raiders and destroy this new weapon before it can cause further devastation.|
|  4  |**Blasphemous Designs:** An artifact has been stolen from the local temple, and the tracks lead to the ratfolk's subterranean lair. The party is tasked with delving into the depths of the lair to retrieve the artifact, but soon discover it is being used to power an immense vermin wheel known as the Wheel of Kill-Doom.|

>
> ***Heavy Set.*** The vermin wheel cannot be shoved, and it has advantage on saving throws against being knocked prone.
>
> ***Rat Wheel.*** The swarm crewing the Treadmill action station is trapped within that station and can't leave until the vermin wheel is destroyed.
>
> ***Skittering Chain Lightning.*** Whenever the vermin wheel finishes moving at least 10 feet, a bolt of lightning leaps to the closest creature within 60 feet of the vermin wheel and not inside it. Another bolt of lightning then leaps from that creature to the closest creature within 30 feet of it that isn’t within the vermin wheel. Creature’s targeted by the lightning must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) lightning damage for every 10 feet the vermin wheel moved on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one (maximum 20d6). If two or more potential targets of a lightning bolt are equidistant from the lightning bolt’s source, choose one at random.
>
> ### Action Stations
>
> ***Helm (Requires 1 Medium creature as Crew and Grants Half Cover).*** The creature Steers the vermin wheel but has no control over how far it moves, only the path it follows. 
>
> ***Treadmill (Requires 1 Large swarm of Tiny creatures as Crew and Three-Quarters cover).*** The swarm powers the vermin wheel, causing the vermin wheel’s speed to become equal to the swarm’s speed until the start of the swarm’s next turn. The swarm cannot steer the vermin wheel, and if no one uses the Helm’s action before the start of the swarm’s next turn, at the start of the swarm’s next turn, the vermin wheel moves its speed forward in a straight line before its speed drops back to 0.

### Vermin Wheel Loot
Because vermin wheels are vehicles, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are items they were carrying or materials salvaged from their remains. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks or may not require a check to spot at all. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Vermin Wheel Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

#### Example Vermin Wheel Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.

### Vermin Wheel Tactics

Due to the vermin wheel's erratic nature and propensity for malfunctioning, its tactics are limited. However, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind:

* The lightning generated by the vermin wheel strikes the closest target that is not inside the wheel. This means it must have a clear path to its intended target, avoiding any allies if present, and should strive to end its movement as close as possible to the target.
* The rats inside the wheel will continue turning it even if the driver dies, causing the wheel to keep moving in its current direction.

#### Hex Flame Wheel Tactics
* The hex flame wheel’s pilot always begins by using Vermin Grease to accelerate the wheel to maximum ramming speed and extend the range of its flamethrower. 
* The pilot may prioritize setting the grease on fire or hitting as many targets as possible with the flamethrower. A helpful rule of thumb is to count setting the grease on fire as equivalent to hitting two targets with the flamethrower. 
* The Flame Siphon ability can help sustain the rats in the Treadmill. If the rats' speed decreases due to being at half health or lower, focus on passing the wheel through the fire until they regain enough health to increase their speed, even if it means temporarily reducing your damage output.

#### Wheel of Kill-Doom Tactics
* The tactics remain the same as the normal vermin wheel, with the only new feature being that the lightning bolt it generates has the ability to jump to another target. Find two enemies close together to avoid the seconded bolt jumping to any allies.

# Ratfolk <Br> Creatures

This section contains <br> descriptions of different <Br> types of ratfolk along <Br> with  creatures commonly <Br> found working alongside <br> them. Any combination <Br>of these creatures could <Br> be found on their own or together.

## Rats 
These verminous rodents <br> are the most well-known <br> and infamous of their kind. <br> Though rats are not inherently <br> evil and can even be kept as pets, <br> they are strongly associated with disease <br> and ruin.  In urban environments, they are notorious for spreading plagues and devouring food stores.  Cities that fail to keep the rat population in check will soon be overwhelmed with rats scurrying through sewers and even out onto the open streets.  In these situations, rats can go from being common pests to harbingers of civilization-ending ruin.  

***Familiars and Test Subjects.*** 
Rats are common familiars for spellcasters, particularly among fiends and fey who enjoy utilizing them as scouts, spies, or agents to spread deadly epidemics.  Other, less fortunate rats are used as subjects for magical experimentation.  They may be used to test recently developed elixirs or to study the effects of new and experimental magic on living organisms.  Most test rats suffer bizarre and terrible deaths, the lucky ones receive extraordinary boons, and a rare few are warped into dark abominations threatening the sanctity of the natural world itself.

***Strength in Numbers.***
Rats are not known for their strength or ferocity, and individually they pose little threat.  Under most circumstances, threatened rats will quickly become frightened and scurry away from danger into the safety of small nooks and crannies.  Rats are more likely to become emboldened when working in large numbers, and a hungry group of rats may become desperate enough to attack larger creatures who appear vulnerable.  When they attack en mass this way, rats can quickly overwhelm their prey, allowing them to tear apart and devour creatures many times their size.

&ensp;***Rats of Unusual Size.*** Occasionally, rats can reach sizes far beyond that of a typical specimen.  These rodents may belong to different species or the result of magical mutations, but the end result is the same.  Their increased size leads to boldness in the face of humanoids and other larger creatures, whom they are more likely to see as food than their smaller kin.  Though they still possess the same cowardice as normal rats, these larger rodents are much more likely to be aggressive towards humanoids.

These enormous rodents can be found stalking caverns, lurking in abandoned buildings, or scurrying deep through city sewers.  They may also be found in the service of hags or subterranean races such as kobolds or goblins.  The most common variety is the giant rat, which can reach the size of coyotes.  However, some monstrous rats are the size of timber wolfs and can easily hunt prey their size and larger, allowing them to serve as disturbing war beasts for unsavory masters.

&ensp; ***Vermin Tide.*** Rats operate most effectively in large numbers.  Nothing demonstrates this more clearly than the formation of a rat swarm.  This congregation of rodents behaves as a single entity, allowing many individually weak rats to suddenly become a serious threat.  Rat swarms may occur naturally if enough rats gather in one concentrated space, or they may result from magical manipulation.  Druids or witches may exert their influence over colonies of rats, whipping them into frenzied swarms to overwhelm their enemies.

If enough rats come together, they may form a dreaded rat tide.  These massive swarms can overwhelm groups of armed soldiers and strip them to the bone in moments.  They may arise in cities overrun with hungry rats, or they might be summoned by powerful dark magic, or they could be unleashed as a form of divine wrath upon a doomed town.  

***Rat Queens.*** Some especially vile rat infestations originate from a dark and unnatural source.  Rats of these infestations behave like eusocial creatures, and at their center is a monstrous rat queen, spawning endless waves of vermin.  These disturbing matriarchs are the size of hippos and barely mobile.  They depend on the protection of their swarm and are capable of rallying their normally cowardly offspring, who will give their life for their queen.  
The origin of these rat queens is unknown, with some theorizing them to result of twisted magical experiments and others believing them to be the creations of some forgotten rat diety.  Whatever the case, the presence of a rat queen quickly spells doom for any unfortunate population near its nest.  The rat queen will often nest in a large abandoned building or sewer system where its swarms will spread forth to bring ruin upon civilization.

## Rat Monstrosities
The following creatures have forms and traits associated <br> with rats found in nature, but nothing is natural about <br> any of these monstrosities.  They may have once been <br> wild creatures twisted into abominations, or they may <br> have entirely magical origins.  They may be isolated cases <br> of monstrous rats or associated with a larger force of <br> rat-like creatures.  In any case,  they are certain to <br> terrorize any would-be adventures unfortunate enough <br> to cross their path.

### Brood Horrors
These monstrous rodents are thought to have once been giant rats subjected to twisted, mutating forces shortly after birth.  Their mutations grant them regenerative powers and rapid growth, which drives a ravenous hunger, leading the brood horror to devour all its litter mates and quickly grow beyond the size of a typical giant rat.  

A fully grown brood horror is a ravenous monster whose bloated body belies its incredible speed, which it uses to run down prey before snatching them up with its whip-like tail.  Subterranean races prize brood horrors as deadly mounts.  But, riding one is a dangerous proposition, for even if the brood horror doesn't devour its rider, should it be slain in combat, it will explode in a mass of poisonous filth deadly <br> to enemy and ally alike.

### Hell Pit Abominations
These unholy horrors appear to be an amalgam of a wyrm and a monstrous rat, with an assortment of extra limbs and mouths haphazardly grafted across its body.  Hell pit abominations are such a horrendously chaotic mess of arms and teeth that no two look alike.  They all possess gargantuan bodies that are vaguely draconic in shape but sport grotesquely rat-like features.  

Because of the unique circumstances involved in the creation of any hell pit abomination, the specifics of their appearance can vary wildly, with some looking akin to horrific flesh golems and others appearing to be eldritch horrors from another dimension.  

***Erratic Actions.*** The behavior of hell pit abominations is difficult to predict in combat because their bodies operate in such an unnatural and erratic manner.  One moment the abomination's limbs may work against each other, causing it to barely keep pace with an average human, and the next moment it will gallop across the battlefield at breakneck speeds.

The abomination's attack patterns are similarly unpredictable.  The monster has an assortment of flailing limbs it can use to pummel foes, but if it is gripped with maddening hunger, it may suddenly lash out with its many slavering mouths.  Other times, the abomination's appendages are occupied with twitching spasms, so it settles for throwing its massive girth against every creature in range.

***Undying Horror.*** The unholy energies that lead to the hell pit abomination's creation also make it exceptionally difficult to slay.  Not only do these monsters regenerate at a rapid pace, but their deaths by no means guarantee an end to their terror. 


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some slain abominations unleash one final burst of eldritch lightning to take their foes down with them, while others are host to massive swarms of bloodthirsty rats which burst from their corpse to devour everything in their path.  Still, others refuse to die altogether and surge back to life to continue the battle against their would-be slayers. 

***Unnatural Origin.*** Hell pit abominations aren't born naturally but are the product of twisted, mutagenic magic.  They are most often the result of a wicked, arcane experiment, akin to the creation of a flesh golem, but on a more massive scale.  These monstrosities are crafted from pieces of huge draconic creatures fused with giant rats.  

Other hell pit abominations may have differing origins.  One may be a giant rat subjected to ancient eldritch rituals that turned it into a conduit for the powers of the Far Realm, while another may have once been a primordial rodent monster sleeping underground only to be awoken by the mutating effects of magical radiation.

***Renegades and Warbeasts.*** The sheer power of a hell pit abomination combined with its erratic nature makes it very difficult to control.  Even abominations purposefully created to serve often break free and unleash their own unpredictable rampages.  These free abominations travel to the most abundant food sources they can find and wreak havoc along the way.  They prefer the taste of humanoid flesh and often attack large groups of travelers, villages, and even large cities.  

As terrifying as rogue hell pit abominations are, the most dangerous of their kind are those being directed by intelligent masters.  These monsters combine overwhelming strength with strategic purpose and can serve a range of purposes, from mighty war beast to lair guardian.

### Rat Ogres

These aptly named monstrosities combine the brutish physique of an ogre with rat-like features and agility.  Rat ogres scurry at a speed that belies their hulking forms and can dodge incoming attacks with rodential dexterity before ripping apart their foes with giant's strength.  

For all their physical prowess, rat ogres are incredibly simple and weak-willed.  Without a master directing their actions, they operate only on a level of base instinct.  These directionless rat ogres may mindlessly rampage towards anything that catches their attention or aimlessly wander in confused circles, unable to make any sense of their surroundings.

Rat ogres are unnatural creatures that don't typically arise in the wild and are instead engineered to be brutal minions and beasts of war.  Mad mages and flesh smiths, particularly those of subterranean races, will combine mutating magic and twisted biological engineering to craft these murderous brutes.   This process allows the rat ogre's creator to endow it with custom features to enhance its combat capabilities, meaning there are no guarantees as to what combination of abilities one will be up against when facing one of these customized monsters.

### Rat Ogre Mutations
If you wish to create a rat ogre with added capabilities, you can apply one or more mutations from the Rat Ogre Mutations table.  For each mutation you apply, increase the rat ogre's CR by 1.

### Wolf Rats

These monstrosities combine the aggression and hunting instincts of wolves with the agility of rats.  Wolf rats roam through the cavernous underground environments and dark forests, always looking for prey to sate their neverending hunger.  No matter how much they eat, they appear malnourished, and they attack any potential meal as though their life depends on it.  

Like owlbears, wolf rats are bizarre hybridized creatures of mysterious origin.  Some claim they are simply one of the many horrors to emerge from the Underdark.  Others believe they were magically engineered as hunting beasts.  If this is the case, they have proven to be unruly and difficult to train.  Wolf rats generally prefer hunting humanoids over taking orders from them.  Those few beast masters who've managed to break them have found wolf rats to be terrifyingly effective at running down and ripping apart soft targets trying to stay out of harm's way.

## Ratfolk Ninjas
The following creatures represent the ratfolk trained in service of their ninja clans.

### Ratfolk Deathmaster

Only the most skilled, cunning, and ruthlessly determined ninja ratfolk can obtain the title of deathmaster. This ratfolk is the paragon of its art, possessed of unbreakable discipline and unrivaled deadliness. Only one ratfolk holds the title of deathmaster at any given time, and the position is highly sought after by master assassins. 

The deathmaster is tasked with only the most vital missions whose success has grand strategic implications for the ratfolk clans at large. No mortal is safe from the deathmaster's reach, whether they be a mighty warlord, paranoid wizard, or powerful monarch secure in a supposedly impregnable fortress. 

In combat, the deathmaster flies in and out of the fray, dispatching foes before disappearing into the shadows, only to launch another attack from an unexpected angle. It wields a deadly weeping blade in each hand and a third with its tail, turning it into a whirlwind of death. Foes who try to pin down the deathmaster find that it can escape from any restraints before disappearing into the darkness using its cloak of shadows. The last thing most pursuers see is the glint of acid-coated blades as the deathmaster unleashes a fatal counterattack.

### Ratfolk Doom Runner

These ratfolk are the elite minions of their clans. Doom runners either lead squads of rip runners or form squads of their own when faced with situations that require the best of the best their clan has to offer. They utilize the same tactics as their rip runner subordinates, but with a near-supernatural level of mastery. Doom runners are often sent deep into enemy territory on what would be suicide missions for any other ratfolk. Here they eliminate high-value targets, steal the most precious of information, and unleash any other forms of mayhem their masters desire. Most importantly, doom runners perform these tasks without leaving any trace of their presence. 

Doom runners are also privy to some of the finest equipment their clans have to offer. They wield deadly blades dripping with poisons that can rapidly subdue even the hardiest of foes. Victims who are repeatedly subjected to their attacks find the toxins to become progressively more devastating, and doom runners are brutally relentless when assaulting high-priority targets.

#### Doom Runners of Renown
These ratfolk are members of some of the most notorious doom runner units, often referred to as doom squads. These renowned doom runners often wear uniforms with distinctive colors and patterns to signify their elite membership. These uniforms also usually pay homage to a particularly well-known master from their clan’s history who may have even been the original founder of the doom squad.

Renowned doom runners possess combat skill that surpasses that of “ordinary” doom runners, making them the elite amongst an already elite class. Besides having greater skill and dexterity, these doom runners have mastered advanced techniques allowing them to mitigate deadly blows from enemies as they retreat from range and prepare counterstrikes. These evasive techniques make them even more difficult foes to pin down and slay, and most who attempt to do so are quickly dispatched by the poison blades of these renowned doom runners.

### Ratfolk Rip Runner

Ratfolk who survive their dangerous apprenticeships as gloom runners can rise through the ranks of their clan to become deadly rip runners. These ratfolk serve as special operations forces, carrying out covert missions that require their level of subtlety and skill. Rip runner missions may include sabotage, espionage, or guerilla warfare. A rip runner strike is often a prelude to a larger ratfolk attack, as they remove key enemy assets, destroy equipment, and weaken defenses to pave the way for a larger strike force.

When engaged in combat, rip runners excel in hit-and-run attacks. Their near-supernatural agility allows them to dodge most attacks with ease, negating the need for armor. This lack of armor allows them to move quickly and operate as effective skirmishers. Rip runners excel at hit-and-run style attacks, utilizing throwing stars to harry their foes before closing in for deadly strikes the moment they see an opening. Enemies find that trying to engage rip runners directly is like grabbing at smoke, and they never strike the same way twice, constantly leaving opponents disoriented.

### Ratfolk Gloom Runner
While most ratfolk are known for employing <br> sneaky, underhanded tactics, gloom runners make <br> a career of it. These  skirmishing soldiers fight in <br> mobile packs that utilize stealth and guerilla tactics to <br> harry their foes.  Once foes look sufficiently weakened <br> and vulnerable, gloom runners move in for the kill, <br> using a flurry of throwing stars and flashing blades <br> to quickly dispatch their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, gloom runners serve as light skirmisher infantry who utilize their mobility to harass and disrupt enemies ahead of attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a dangerous task with a low survival rate, ensuring that only the most skilled gloom runners advance far in their careers.

### Ratfolk Ninja Assassin

Those few ratfolk who manage to ascend through the ranks of their shadowy clan may eventually become dreaded assassins, representing the pinnacle of their deadly art. These dreaded killers carry out the most vital missions of their clan and usually hire their services out to other clans and even non-ratfolk. Assassins usually operate alone, carrying out operations that would be impossible for multiple ratfolk to accomplish. Killing important figures in heavily guarded locations, tracking the whereabouts of elusive individuals, and pilfering priceless information or artifacts are all within the prevue of an assassin. 

<br><br>

In times of war, assassins will often disguise as rank-and-file ratfolk, joining their kin in battle until they come within range of a high-value target. At that moment, the assassin springs forth dispatching foes with a whirl of poisoned blades, appearing as a blurred shadow as they deal death to their unprepared victims. At other times, assassins are tasked with sneaking behind enemy lines to slay dangerous but fragile targets, such as commanders, spellcasters, or weapon crews. Their speed and agility allow them to perform such strikes and retreat before their enemies can react to the attack.

This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

#### Master Assassins
The most skilled assassins are given the title of Master, and it is said only thirteen such masters exist at any one time. These assassins possess a level of agility that surpasses that of nearly any mortal creature, making it almost impossible to land a meaningful strike on them. And any who attempt to do so will be mercilessly cut down by a flurry of poisoned attacks in the process. 

The skill of these assassins is such that their clan almost never makes their services available to outsiders and they are only assigned the most vital of missions. On the rare occasions that their clan must wage open war, their nimble forces are led by master assassins able to expertly direct their clan members and maximize their deadly potential.

### Ratfolk Ninja Sorcerer

These mystics wield shadowy magics designed to aid <br> the warriors of their clan. Ninja sorcerers are quite <br> rare, and they are very secretive about the nature of <br> their magic. How they recruit new members and how <br> their ranks are organized is a mystery even to many <br> with their clans. They rarely consort with those outside <br> the ranks of the ratfolk ninja clans and usually only <br> carry out missions in direct service of their shadowy <br> masters. 

Ninja sorcerers are typically assigned to support larger groups of their clan carrying out covert missions, where <br> their magic can be put to maximum effect. Their spells conjure shadows and illusions to confuse foes and provide cover for their allies. Ninja sorcerers can also enhance the combat ability of their allies, making their already swift <br> and stealthy clan members even faster and stealthier. If enemies attempt to engage them directly, they can quickly throw up smoke and shadow, disappearing out of sight <br> before rallying their allies for a deadly counterstrike.

### Ratfolk Triad

The ninja clans of the ratfolk focus on training <br> skirmishers and covert operatives for special <br> operations and make less use of the traditional <br> soldiers of other clans. Still, there are times <br> when it becomes necessary for these clans to <br> field ratfolk who can operate as battlefield <br> soldiers and engage foes more directly. The <br> largest and most physically imposing of the <br> ninja clans are trained as triads to fulfill this <br> role They combine the martial tactics of <br> their clan with traditional battlefield <br> training to become deadly and evasive <br> light infantry. 

Though triads don’t wear the heavy armor <br> of other soldiers, they possess the natural <br> evasiveness of their clan which helps them <br> avoid harm as they utilize their deadly <br> polearms.  These polearms are tipped with <br> insidious weeping blades which earn their <br> name from the caustic acid that continually <br> drips from their edge. This acid burns <br> through the flesh and armor of their <br> enemies, allowing triads to dispatch <br> even the most formidable and heavily <br> armored of foes.

#### Triad of Duplicity

These triads have studied the shadowy magics of their <br> clans to gain supernatural powers of illusion. At a <br> moment’s notice, they can summon illusory <br> doppelgangers of themselves, making them appear <br> to be in two locations at once. Triads of duplicity use <br> these abilities to bewilder foes on the battlefield, <br> appearing to charge from one direction only to pop <br> out and attack from another. 

An entire squad of triads may be made of illusionary decoys, meant to draw enemies into vulnerable <br> positions or trick them into squandering valuable <br> resources attempting to destroy their fake foes. Once <br> their prey has fallen for the ruse, the real triads leap <br> from hiding and make them pay dearly for their <br> mistake.

> ##### Optional Rule: Smoke Bombs
>In place of an attack as part of an Attack action, the ratfolk can throw a smoke grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. The grenade emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area within a 20-foot radius of where it lands. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

### Ninja Ratfolk Tactics
Most ninja ratfolk utilize the standard tactics for their clans described in the Ninja Ratfolk Clans section (pg. 5). The level of training and discipline different ratfolk have will determine how well they can execute these tactics without falling pray to their skittish nature. The presence of a powerful clan leader will keep subordinate ratfolk in line as they seek to earn the favor of their masters while avoiding their wrath, and such leaders are masters of subtly coordinating the efforts of their clan members.

The following ninja ratfolk have some unique considerations to keep in mind.

#### Tactics: Gloom Runner

Gloom runners are the least trained and most expendable members of their clans. Though they prefer surprise attacks, they may also attack the players head-on if they see an opportunity, relying on speed and numbers rather than ambushes. They utilize most of the tactics common to other ninja ratfolk but are less sophisticated in their execution of these tactics and are more likely to lose their cool if the battle starts to go awry.

#### Tactics: Triads of Duplicity
Invoke Duplicity can be used in several ways. It can be kept close to the triad, boosting the triad’s combat power, or moved around the battlefield to set up more elaborate ploys. These could include initiating combat with illusions to trick players into wasting spells on fake enemies while the real triads launch an ambush, using the illusions to facilitate a retreat, or using illusions to trick the players into thinking they’re outnumbered.

#### Tactics: Ninja Assassins and Master Assassins
These ratfolk are one-hit wonders. Most of their damage output depends on them comboing a Sneak Attack with Assassinate on the first round of combat. After that, they aren’t much better than doom runners. If they aren’t winning the fight after the first round of combat, most assassins will retreat unless they have been charged with leading larger attack forces.

#### Tactics: Ninja Sorcerers
This sneaky spell caster primarily uses its spells to support its minions while staying out of reach of the players. What spells it casts will depend on whether it has the chance to prepare and what minions it has at its disposal. Below are tips on how to use its spells:

#### Pre-combat Spells

&emsp;***Haste.*** If the sorcerer has an especially powerful ally, like an **assassin**, it will be inclined to cast this spell on it. To maintain concentration, the sorcerer will take extra care to avoid attacks from the players.

***Pass Without Trace.*** This spell is useful if the sorcerer has 5 or more weaker minions within range and they are going to attempt to sneak up on the players.

***Toxic Coating.*** If the sorcerer's minions are spread out and can't make use of *pass without trace*, it can chose the minion with the highest attack bonus and use this spell on one of its weapons.

##### Combat Spells
&emsp;***Black Whirlwind.*** This is the best opening spell, and the sorcerer will use it whenever it can hit three or more players with the spell at once.

***Brittle Bones.*** Once the sorcerer is no longer maintaining concentration on any spells it cast before combat, he will cast this spell on whichever targetable player has the lowest bonus to Constitution saving throws (the sorcerer is very intelligent and can usually determine which player this will be.)

***Darkness.*** The sorcerer will use this spell to provide its minions with areas to hide if there is nothing available for them on the battlefield. The spell can also be used in place of *smoke shroud* if it has no more uses of that spell left.

***Silence.*** The sorcerer will use this niche spell if there are two or more spell-casting players it can interfere with using it.

***Smoke Shroud.*** The sorcerer will save this spell for the turns during which it's frightened as a result of its Scurry Away feature.

***Spider Climb.*** This is primarily a way for the sorcerer to escape the players by climbing up the walls of its hideout.

#### Tactics: The Deathmaster
The deathmaster is the most powerful ninja ratfolk and a boss enemy with a unique attack style. Like most ninja ratfolk, it is relatively fragile and won't do well standing toe-to-toe with players. Instead, it will make heavy use of its Slink ability to retreat into hiding before making its next attack. Its Slip and Shank legendary actions even allow it to do this multiple times in a round. And its Slip Away bonus action should keep it from ever getting pinned down for more than a round.

The deathmaster shouldn't make attacks that leave it out in the open and within melee range of the players. It will bide its time in hiding while it waits for an opening, moving from location to location and taking the Dodge and Hide actions. Its high Intelligence and Wisdom allow it to size up the strengths and weaknesses of the players as though it can read the stats off their character sheets. Fragile spell casters and characters with high Perception will be the highest priority targets. 

If the deathmaster can secure Sneak Attacks using its throwing stars, it can keep its distance from the players while still racking up heavy damage. Though, an alternate strategy could involve attacking many different players with weeping blades to coat them all in acid, thereby forcing them to use up their actions cleaning off the acid or accept damage and armor degradation each turn. The Whirl of Weeping blades legendary action is also effective at applying acid to many players at once, though it should generally be reserved for situations where the deathmaster has been surrounded and doesn't have a clear method of escape.

### Ninja Ratfolk Quick Tips

* Cunning Actions can be used while frightened.

#### Rip Runners & Doom Runners

* If you can sneak attack with your throwing star, you don’t have much reason to move into melee

* If you can’t sneak attack with your throwing star, you can use it to set up a sneak attack with your sword if you have no other way of  getting a sneak attack off

#### Doom Runners

* Nimble Reflexes is easy to forget. Don’t let your players shoot down these enemies that easily!

#### Doom Runners of Renown

* Don’t be shy about using Scurry and Dodge. It will keep these rats alive.

#### Triads

* Hitting multiple players with weeping blades can force more of them to use up their actions scraping off the acid.
 
#### Triads of Duplicity

* Mark which illusion is paired with each triad to make tracking them in combat easier.
* Whenever possible, have the triad and its illusion attack the same target at the same time to make it harder for players to tell which one is real.

#### Ninja Assassins and Master Assassins

* Your top priority is landing a Sneak Attack with your Assassinate feature in the first round of combat.

#### The Deathmaster
* Slink and Shank are your bread-and-butter moves for slipping in and out of combat
* Get your Sneak Attack in every round. If you don’t have allies, do this by hiding, turning invisible, or setting it up with a Toxic Star attack.
* Spend as much time hidden between attacks as possible.

### Ninja Ratfolk Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. 

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. In the case of a ninja sorcerer, you may use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check instead. 


#### Ninja Ratfolk Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Ratfolk Packmasters

Though the many giant rats and other rat  monstrosities lurking beneath the world's surface can be devastating weapons when  unleashed upon one's enemies, few <br> possess the capabilities to control them reliably <br> enough to do so. Ratfolk have a special affinity for <br> such creatures, and ratfolk packmasters are experts <br> at controlling these monsters and goading them into <br> battle. Packmasters utilize whips to keep their <br> bestial charges in line and to use as a weapon <br> when necessary. With each snap of the whip, <br> their war beasts are driven to heightened <br> levels of aggression. 

Packmasters also use wicked weapons <br> known as things-catchers, which, as the name <br> implies, they use to catch things. These <br> two-handed polearms have a large, tong-like <br> head with the inside of their grips lined with <br> spikes. Packmasters can use these weapons to <br> painfully capture and control creatures at a <br> distance, whether it's a new beast to train or <br> an enemy for their beasts to tear apart.

## Ratfolk Poisoned <br> Wind Bombardiers

This insidious ratfolk infantry specializes in the <br> use of toxic wind globes. These glass orbs <br> unleash clouds of toxic gas when they shatter, <br> overwhelming groups of foes with choking fumes. <br> A squad of these ratfolk can bring down entire enemy formations with poison gas, and they are especially <br> adept at fumigating foes trapped in enclosed spaces. <br> As such, poisoned-wind bombardiers  are often used to <br> deal with enemies bunkered within rooms or <br> enclosed fortifications.

Poisoned-wind bombardiers wear heavy robes and <br> gas masks made to protect them from their poisons, <br> though, in combat, this gear does not protect them <br> entirely from their gasses. This, combined with the <br> fragility of the toxic wind globes they carry, <br> makes heavy combat hazardous for these ratfolk, <br> and many a bombardier has died to the same gases <br> that slew its foes. As such, most bombardiers stay out <br> of the fray, dropping poisoned globes in the path of <br> pursuers or hurling them into crowds at a distance.

### Doom Globe Bombardiers

The doom globe bombardiers, the elite cadre of the ratfolk's poisoned-wind infantry, represent the pinnacle of alchemical warfare. Known among their kin as the harbingers of annihilation, they are surrounded by an air of dread and respect, born out of their deadly expertise and the horrifying effectiveness of their weaponry.

The doom globes they carry are a testament to their terrifying alchemical skills. Larger and more intricately constructed than regular toxic wind globes, these lethal weapons contain concentrated concoctions of the deadliest gases known to ratfolk alchemy. A single doom globe can release a cloud of poisonous gas so vast and deadly that it can wipe out an entire battalion.

Doom globe bombardiers are often assigned critical missions that require the complete eradication of enemy forces or to breach heavily fortified positions. Despite their elite status, bombardiers are still viewed with a certain amount of trepidation by their peers. The deadly potency of their globes and the high casualty rate in their ranks serves as a constant reminder of the thin line they tread between life and death.

### Toxic Wind Bombardier Tactics  
The toxic wind bombardiers play a crucial role in disrupting enemy groups by acting as debuffers and providing cover for their army. They achieve this by deploying poison gas clouds to blind their opponents. While they are resistant effects of the poison wind orbs they handle, they still exercise caution. Close combat is avoided, as any melee attack could shatter the orbs before they are thrown. To prevent such mishaps, they prefer to keep at least 30 feet from their targets while hurling the orbs, employing the Devious Bombardier ability to maintain this distance effectively.

When an opponent is severely injured and poisoned, and the bombardiers have numerical superiority, they may decide to move in and switch to dagger attacks.

It's important that other ratfolk avoid close proximity to toxic wind bombardiers due to the fear of a globe accidentally shattering. Even when fighting in a group, multiple toxic wind bombardiers spread out from each other, converging only when preparing to engage in melee combat.

### Toxic Wind Bombardier Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk engineers is identifying what equipment they're carrying still has any functional value. They may also drop toxic wind globes the players can collect for their own use or sale to black market vendors. They may also drop toxic wind globes the players can collect for their own use or sale to black market vendors. You can track the globes as the ratfolk use them and allow players to loot any unused globes if they can defeat the bombardiers before they're all shattered.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. 

#### Eldritch Engineer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Ratfolk Soldiers & Seers
The following creatures represent the ratfolk who make up the bulk of their combat-ready forces, including their martial and mystical leadership.

### Ratfolk Chieftains
These ratfolk occupy some of the highest positions of authority within their society. Chieftans are accomplished warriors and commanders who often command smaller groups of ratfolk within a clan. They usually answer to a more powerful warlord who may have several chieftains at his command. Though they must obey their commander without question, chieftains usually rule their given domain with absolute authority and quickly quash any potential usurpers. By the same token, chieftains usually eye the position of warlord with envy, and those who are bold and opportunistic enough will eventually make a bid for greater power. 

In combat, chieftains command other ratfolk much the same way as their warlord superiors. They possess elite training, equipment, and resolve, and their commanding presence helps keep other ratfolk from routing. As such, chieftains are often put in command of strike forces charged with dangerous missions that require higher levels of bravery than ratfolk are typically inclined to provide.

### Ratfolk Warriors

Ratfolk are a prolific, though short-lived, race. They rarely want for numbers, though few of their kind have the opportunity to develop specialized skills. In battle, ratfolk clans leverage the quantity-over-quality approach of their race to field overwhelming numbers of otherwise unremarkable troops. All healthy ratfolk are equipped with basic weapons and armor and given enough rudimentary training to put it to use. These warriors then utilize their overwhelming mass to break enemy fighters they would otherwise be unable to defeat in a one-on-one fight.

#### Volcanic Slashers

Some ratfolk clans make their underground homes in volcanic regions. They quickly learn how to utilize their fiery environment to their advantage, burrowing their homes around magma chambers that provide molten rock, useful for defending their lair with lava traps. The magma also proves useful for forging equipment, and ratfolk of these clans learn to imbue all their weapons with fiery properties. 

The warriors of these clans also prove to be much hardier and heat resilient, as those lacking these qualities don’t last long within their volcanic homes. Known as volcanic slashers, these specialty warriors combine their high fortitude with flaming weapons to burn their way across the battlefield.

### Ratfolk Grey Prophets

These eldritch ratfolk are born with grey or white fur and small horns that set them apart from their kin and mark them for a path of arcane greatness. They are trained to be grey prophets, the spiritual leaders of ratfolk society who serve as messengers for their verminous god. This position of divine authority allows grey prophets to remain somewhat above the petty machinations and power plays of other ratfolk, and even powerful warlords are weary of incurring the ire of a grey prophet and, by proxy, its rat god.

 The favor of the rat god is made evident through the grey prophet's devastating magical abilities. Using their ruinous magic, these ratfolk can conjure blasts of elemental magic, summon massive rat tides, or drive their allies into self-destructive battle frenzies. They are also notoriously difficult to pin down in combat, able to scurry just out of reach before unleashing their destructive magic. The protection of the rat god is ever-present, and even those able to make seemingly accurate attacks against a grey prophet will often find their strikes suddenly veer off course, or their spells lose potency just as they reach their target.

### Ratfolk Slaves

These ratfolk represent the bottom rung of their <br> society. Numerous and expendable, they are <br> responsible for the lowliest and most dangerous <br> tasks, from unskilled labor to grislily test subjects. <br> Their low quality of life and hazardous duties make <br> their lives mercifully short, and most ratfolk slaves accomplish little with the time they have. 

In battle, other ratfolk use their slaves as canon <br> fodder to bog down foes. Their expendable nature <br> means other ratfolk have few qualms about giving <br> them suicidal tasks, and ratfolk slaves are often <br> subjected to friendly fire from the spells and <br> artillery of their ratfolk “allies.” 

Despite their frail nature and inferior physical <br> abilities, these lowly ratfolk can be quite ferocious <br> when they feel they have the upper hand. They <br> relish the opportunity to be tormenters rather <br> than the tormented and will utilize every <br> underhanded tactic available to them. However, <br> these ratfolk are cowards among a race known <br> for cowardice, and the moment the fight turns <br> against them, they are prone to scurry away. <br> Ratfolk slaves who die a coward’s death are liable <br> to get one last spiteful bite in as recompense for <br> a short, meaningless life of fear and pain.

### Ratfolk War Vermin


These ratfolk soldiers are the most massive and elite of their kind. Future war vermin are identified at a young age by their clan as their size, aggressiveness, and dark fur easily distinguish them from the rest of their litter. They are then raised via brutal training regiments designed to shape them into elite warriors. Packs of war vermin are given the best equipment in the clan and go on to serve as heavy infantry and personal retinues for powerful ratfolk commanders.

<br><br>

In combat, war vermin are less prone to the cowardice of most rat folk soldiers. Their higher resolve and heavy armor allow them to hold the line against enemy combatants, and their size, training, and deadly weaponry allow them to cut a swath through most ordinary soldiers. Thus, war vermin are often charged with protecting critical locations and individuals or leading rallying charges against particularly imposing foes.

#### Council Guard
These albino war vermin are the most elite bodyguards in the ratfolks' under-empire. Though their origin is unknown, the council guard serve the most elite members of ratfolk society with an unquestioning loyalty almost alien to most ratfolk. No amount of bribery or coercion can shake a guard member's loyalty. They are even mute, thus preventing them from accidentally spilling any of their master's secrets. 


<br>

In combat, these hulking warriors fight with many times the ferocity of an ordinary war vermin. Their implacable natures mean they will fight to the death if necessary, and no amount of magic can charm or frighten them into submission.

### Ratfolk Warlords

Though ratfolk aren’t known for their valor or powers of leadership, those that rise to the top of their martial <br> hierarchy possess an underhanded ferocity that can’t <br> be denied. These warlords combine martial skill, <br> devious tactics, and the ability to rally their otherwise <br> cowardly kin, making them foes that are <br> underestimated all too often. Even when a ratfolk <br> force appears to be routing, one rallying cry from <br> their warlord can turn them from a fleeing army <br> to one that’s quickly overwhelming their <br> overconfident enemies. 

When engaging enemies, ratfolk warlords can <br> utilize an array of weaponry, though brutal <br> spike fists are among their most favored tools. <br> They never fight fair and often use feinting <br> tactics, fleeing from  enemies who appear to <br> have a strong position and striking back at <br> them the moment they show weakness. <br> These strategies also serve to distract and <br> draw out their foes, allowing their minions to <br> surround and swarm the now vulnerable targets.

### Ratfolk Soldiers & Seers Tactics
Most of these ratfolk use the standard tactics described in the Running Ratfolk Adventures section (pg. 4). The differences between different types of soldiers mostly come down to how disciplined they are, with the weaker ratfolk being the least reliable and the more powerful ratfolk being more stalwart and better able to coordinate and execute their tactics. 

The presence of a ratfolk leader makes a big difference in how long a ratfolk force will hold out before routing, and someone as powerful as a warlord or grey prophet can keep the minions in their immediate vicinity in the fight far longer than they would otherwise hold out before fleeing. 

The following ratfolk have some unique considerations to keep in mind.

#### Tactics: Ratfolk Slaves
These wretches are generally used as cannon fodder by other ratfolk. They often spend as much time fleeing the players as they do fighting them. This “strategy” does give them a better shot at using their Cornered Rat ability before they are slain. Ratfolk slaves are also considered so expendable by other ratfolk that seeing them fleeing or slain isn’t a bother, and other ratfolk are unlikely to break and flee as a result.

#### Tactics: Council Guards
These are the most elite ratfolk soldiers and most atypical of their kind in terms of their combat behavior. Their primary goal is to safeguard their commander, and their Scurry Towards feature lets them intercept players trying to chase down said commander. Council guards will also never flee a fight if doing so would put the commander in jeopardy.

#### Tactics: Grey Prophet
Like most spellcasters, grey prophets will try to stay out of reach of the players and use minions as a meat shield. *Fissure* is an excellent spell for creating terrain that impedes the players, and Vermintide can be used to drop tides of rats on players who’ve fallen into the fissure or are trying to attack the grey prophet. If players do manage to close into melee range, the hex staff attacks do high damage and prevent reactions, giving the grey prophet an opening to retreat.

### Ratfolk Soldiers & Seers Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying which materials they're carrying that have functional value.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. In the case of a grey prophet, you may use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check instead. 


#### Ratfolk Soldiers & Seers Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Ratfolk Eldritch Engineers

The eldritch engineers are a horrifying fusion of sorcerer, scientist, and engineer, embodying the raw ambition and unbounded deviousness of the ratfolk. They are selected from the most cunning and intelligent of their brood, demonstrating exceptional skill and a ruthless ingenuity to rise above their kin.

Their role is dual-natured, as they devote equal time to the study of arcane arts and the sciences of engineering and alchemy. Their lairs are often cluttered with both arcane artifacts and complex mechanical devices. They use their knowledge to forge devastating weapons, animate mad vehicles, and manipulate the very fabric of reality.

A eldritch engineer is a terrifying sight to behold, a grim fusion of organic and mechanical. Their hunched bodies, wrapped in shadowy robes, are an intricate network of self-made, mechanical augmentations and arcane devices, often lit by the eerie glow of the irradiated minerals they utilize.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They stand slightly taller than the average ratfolk, though their hunched posture can sometimes belie their true height. Their fur is usually patchy and discolored from constant exposure to their potent power source, and their eyes gleam with an unsettling, predatory intelligence.

Body parts lost in combat or laboratory mishaps are commonly replaced with mechanical augmentations. These range from simple, metallic prosthetics to complex contraptions designed to enhance physical capabilities. An eldritch engineer might have a multi-jointed mechanical arm equipped with various tools and weaponry, or a prosthetic leg with incorporated shock-absorbing springs for enhanced agility.

Their heads are often adorned with complex eyepieces that serve as telescopes, microscopes, or even as targeting systems for their weapons. They might have a network of tubes and wires injected into their bodies, delivering a constant supply of the irradiated minerals to boost their magical prowess and physical resilience.

The eldritch engineers are known for their intricate and devastating arsenal, a testament to their wicked blend of magic and technology. Their weapons, powered by the potent, irradiated minerals they mine from the depths, are as diverse as they are deadly.

Eldritch engineers have innovated a line of firearms that stand apart from any standard weaponry. These include eldritch muskets and pistols whose barrels are etched with arcane runes and loaded with shards of the irradiated mineral, not mere lead shot. When fired, these weapons unleash blasts of magical energy that can tear through armor and sear flesh, leaving behind wounds that fester with otherworldly radiation.

Beyond these "standard" weapons, each engineer builds their own custom devious devices to bring into battle and test on unwitting foes. These machines range from flamethrowers to rocket launchers to machines capable of generating seismic tremors. This makes every encounter with a eldritch engineer a wildly unpredictable affair, as there's no predicting what the mad rat will whip out next.

To power these devious devices, eldritch engineers can channel eldritch power through their partially mechanical forms, building up higher and higher levels over time. Once their bodies are crackling with power, they will channel it all through one of their deadly weapons, unleashing a wave of devastation upon as many foes as possible. If a few minions become collateral damage in the process, then so be it. It's a small price to pay for a successful weapons test.

### Master Eldritch Engineer

The master eldritch engineers are the epitome of the ratfolk's insidious ambition and genius, representing the pinnacle of their society's arcane-technological mastery. They are the eldritch engineers' most accomplished, the most advanced, and the maddest of the mad, possessing the deadliest inventions and the power to command and control their brethren. Their status is not given lightly; each master eldritch engineer must prove their worth through arcane prowess, engineering genius, and a ruthless drive for power. 


Master eldritch engineer are often more machine than flesh, with a plethora of mechanical limbs, arcane enhancements, and complex devices incorporated into their being. Their enhancements are the most sophisticated, often made from rare and highly durable materials, imbued with powerful spells for protection and strength. Some even replace their hearts with mechanical pumps powered by irradiated minerals, extending their lifespan and imbuing them with incredible resilience.

A master eldritch engineer's workshop is a sprawling labyrinth of machinery and magic, stretching across massive underground halls. Here, amidst the controlled chaos of their laboratories, they construct their masterpieces of destruction. The air buzzes with raw arcane power, while countless mechanical constructs work tirelessly to bring their master's visions to life.

As the leaders of their society, master eldritch engineers hold the highest authority, guiding the actions of their underlings with an iron fist. Their word is law in the warren, and their orders are executed without question. However, their authority is not entirely unchallenged, as each master eldritch engineer is a potential rival, leading to a complex web of alliances, betrayals, and power struggles.

Above all, master eldritch engineers are visionaries in their own twisted way. They harbor grand dreams of surfacing from their subterranean confines to dominate the world above. And through their ever-evolving schemes and growing arsenal of minions and mad machinery, they are always moving closer to making their dreams a reality.

### Epic Chief Eldritch Engineer Battle

If you wish to make the chief eldritch into an endgame threat, you can have him start the encounter piloting a **wheelz of doom** crewed with an **irradiated rat tide** and give him the following trait; this increases the CR of the encounter to CR 23: <br>


***Devious Master Driver.*** The ratfolk can pilot vehicles even while affected by its Scurry Away feature (this doesn't allow the vehicle to be piloted multiple times in a round). When the ratfolk uses its Scurry Away feature, it can have the vehicle it's piloting move up to 15 feet away rather than flee on foot.

Additionally, when the ratfolk pilots a vehicle, it can expend any number of eldritch power levels to increase the speed of the vehicle by 10 feet per power level expended until the end of the turn.

Finally, the ratfolk can't be moved or teleported from a vehicle it's piloting against its will, and when the ratfolk would take damage, it can choose to have the vehicle take the damage instead.

### Power Conduits
If the chief eldritch engineer is fighting in his lair, you can increase the challenge of the encounter by giving him access to power conduits built to charge his powers. Each power conduit is a large magical object with 60 hit points, resistance to all damage, and an AC of 19. You can place one or more of these power conduits throughout the lair, and each power conduit added increases the chief eldritch engineer's Challenge Rating by 1.

At the end of the chief engineer's turn, he can choose to start drawing power from the nearest conduit, creating a beam between him and the conduit; the chief engineer can do this even if he is incapacitated. While the beam is active, the conduit loses all resistances. The beam will break if the chief engineer moves more than 100 feet away from it, if he has total cover from the conduit, or if either the chief engineer or the conduit is reduced to 0 hit points. Any creature or object that moves through the beam can also break it, but it takes 22 (5d8) lightning damage as a result.

If the chief engineer starts his next turn with the beam still intact, the beam dissipates, and he may choose to either roll an additional 2d4 when activating his Unlimited Power trait this turn or end a spell of 4th level or lower in his lair.

### Forbidden Devices

Ratfolk eldritch engineers possess a unique arsenal of magic items specifically designed for use against their adversaries. An eldritch engineer can select two items, while a master eldritch engineer can select three from the list below. The chief eldritch engineer can select 4 devices from the list below and gains an extra damage type resistance along with a new legendary action as part of his Forbidden Enhancements feature. 

The same device can be chosen more than once. Each device requires an action to use and can't be used again until the engineer has had time to rebuild it using Smith's Tools during a long rest.


#### Brass Orb
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is  capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If the ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can throw the device at a point it can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 15 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) force damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When the ratfolk attempts to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the ratfolk this way, it drops the brass orb, which detonates at its location.



##### Brass Orb: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Force<br>
**New Legendary Action:** A target creature within 120 feet of the ratfolk that the ratfolk can see must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target is teleported to an unoccupied space of the ratfolk's choice that it can see within 20 feet of the target. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

#### Doom Rocket
When launched, this missile shrieks through the air before striking the ground and unleashing a wave of bright, glowing green light that irradiates anything near the impact site.

The ratfolk cannot use this device if it is restrained or grappled. When the ratfolk uses the Doom Rocket, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and launches it at a point it can see within 120 feet. The rocket detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage plus an additional 5 (1d10) radiant damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the ratfolk attempts to launch the rocket, <Br> creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity <br> attacks against it. If a creature hits the ratfolk in this way, <br> the rocket misfires and detonates at its location.

\columnbreak

##### Doom Rocket: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Radiant<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) radiant damage, and if the target is a creature, it becomes irradiated for the next minute. At the end of the irradiated creature's turn, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, both it and each creature within 10 feet of it take 9 (2d8) radiant damage; on a successful save, the irradiated effect ends. A *lesser restoration spell* will remove the radiation.

#### Earth Render

This mechanized spike jackhammers into the ground, creating a localized earthquake capable of reducing the structures of surface dwellers into rubble.

When the ratfolk uses the Earth Render, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and rams the device into the ground, creating violent tremors. Each creature in a 25-foot cube originating from the ratfolk must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. Structures in the area take double damage from the effect.

##### Earth Render: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Thunder<br>
**New Legendary Action:** A creature of the ratfolk's choice standing on earth or stone within 60 feet of the ratfolk must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature becomes restrained. Any creature, including the buried creature, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 19 Strength check. If the creature attempting the rescue has a burrow speed, it has advantage on this check.

#### Hex Lightning Generator
This strange metallic device hums with power before emitting a tremendous bolt of green lightning.

When the ratfolk uses the Hex Lightning Generator, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and hurls a magical green lightning bolt at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its reaction.
 
##### Hex Lighting Generator: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Lightning<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) lightning damage, and if the target is a creature, it becomes charged with hex electricity. At the end of the charged creature's next turn, the electricity deals 18 (4d8) lightning damage, after which the hex electricity dissipates. Another creature that touches the charged creature can choose to take the lightning damage immediately, thereby ending the effect.
  

 
#### Hex Fume Sprayer
This device's canister contains toxic gases that can be expelled in a wave through a large, rusty nozzle. 

When the ratfolk uses the Hex Fume Sprayer, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and sprays toxic fumes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage plus an additional 5 (1d8) poison damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become poisoned until the start of the ratfolk's next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.
 
\columnbreak

##### Hex Fume Sprayer: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Poison<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere at a point within 60 feet of itself, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 13 (3d8) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.

#### Hex Scorcher
This arm-mounted flamethrower spews lines of flames that cling to anything in their path.

When the ratfolk uses the Hex Scorcher, it expends all its eldritch energy levels to unleash a gout of flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in the direction of its choice. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) fire damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be set on fire. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't set on fire. A creature that's been set on fire this way takes 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse the fire.



##### Hex Scorcher: Forbidden Enhancement
**Damage Type Resistance:** Fire<br>
**New Legendary Action:** The ratfolk makes a Ranged or Melee Spell Attack, with a +11 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, or a range of 100/400 feet, targeting one creature. On a hit, the target takes 9 (2d8) fire damage, and if the target is a creature, it is set on fire. Until a creature uses an action to douse the fire, the burning creature takes 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

### Eldritch Engineer Tactics
Eldritch engineers, along with master engineers, are extremely intelligent ratfolk who delight in testing their diabolical weaponry on players. In combat, their primary objective is to eliminate as many targets as possible using their advanced artillery, often disregarding the casualties of their own minions caught in the crossfire.

Eldritch engineers possess a versatile arsenal, including ranged attacks, area of effect damage, and some melee capabilities. When using a vehicle, they can also serve as cavalry units, making their tactical approach highly adaptable. Their power output each turn depends on their eldritch power level.

**Initiation.** At the start of combat, the engineer will attempt to fire its pistol, reload as a bonus action, and fire again, maximizing damage against a target surrounded by minions.

**Closing In.** The eldritch engineer can also utilize its hex blade, which consumes eldritch power levels for amplified damage. When opting for this strategy, the eldritch engineer will usually first shoot with the pistol, then engage in melee combat with the hex blade. This attack option is best used when an enemy is lower on health or when the ratfolk and its allies greatly outnumber their opponents.

**Hexmuskets.** If equipped with a musket, the engineer maintains a greater distance from enemies while firing at surrounded foes to use its Overwhelming Mass feature.

#### Forbidden Devices

When deciding whether to use Forbidden Devices, the engineer considers the available eldritch power levels and the number of potential targets. A handy trick when trying to decide if the engineer will use a device on any given turn is to consider each power level it has and the number of targets it could hit as individual incentives. At the start of its turn, if there are 4 or more "incentives," it will likely use the device.

\columnbreak

The engineer does not hesitate to sacrifice its own minions when using its devices unless the minions hold significant value. Lesser ratfolk soldiers are generally considered disposable.



#### Retreat 
Warlocks retreat from combat when they're outnumbered two to one in melee, their health drops below one-third, or they run out of Forbidden Devices or minions. During a retreat, they can still reload their weapon, enabling the engineer with a musket to keep its distance from melee opponents while taking pot shots at their pursuers.

#### Serving As Repair Rats
With their high-level tools skills and ability to perform tool checks even while frightened by their Scurry Away feature, eldritch engineers can act as mobile repair rats, helping sustain weapons teams or vehicles. They cease repairs only when there is nothing left to fix or when deploying a Forbidden Device presents a greater incentive.

For an eldritch engineer serving as a backline repair rat, equipping them with doom rockets, a hex lightning generator, and a musket is recommended, as this allows them to function as true artillery masters.

#### Mounted on Vehicles

Eldritch engineers with vehicles stick to ranged attacks combined with opportunistic hit-and-run strikes. They assault the enemy with Forbidden Devices and gunfire, then charge when they identify a weakness or accumulate a significant number of eldritch power levels for a high-damage vehicle crash. The thrill of crushing an enemy with a lightning-fast vehicle often entices engineers to charge in, even when it may not be the most strategic choice. An engineer armed with a hex blade and hexlock pistol is more inclined to engage in melee combat compared to one equipped with a musket.

### Chief Eldritch Engineer Tactics

The chief engineer is a cunning rat with an intense desire to obliterate foes with his impressive array of technological prowess. The strategies outlined below are designed to optimize his capabilities while offering clear cues to opponents, allowing them to form counter strategies so they gain a sense of agency in combat.

#### Unlimited Power!
This ability turns the battle into a race against time. The chief eldritch engineer will either overpower his adversaries with immense damage or succumb to his own power surges.


#### Forbidden Devices
The chief engineer possesses four Forbidden Devices, and he is quick to employ them when faced with significant threats. If he has three or more eldritch power levels, he will activate a device every turn. Alternatively, he'll use them whenever he can target three or more enemies. However, he will always keep one device in reserve to grant him an extra Legendary Action thanks to his Forbidden Augmentation ability.

When the engineer uses a device selected for his Forbidden Augmentation as a legendary action, he will usually activate the same device as an action on his subsequent turn. This sequence provides players with both a warning of what the device can do and an escalating sense of drama leading up to the device's deployment. 

**Brass Orb & Earth Render.** These legendary actions should be used to manipulate enemy positioning to maximize their impact when they're used as actions.


**Hex Scorcher & Hex Lightning Generator.** These legendary actions can be used to bait opponents into aiding their allies, tricking them into grouping together so they can all be hit by the device's actions.

**Doom Rocket & Hex Fume Sprayer.** These legendary actions  can be used to make parts of the battlefield hazardous for players, thus herding them into positions where the device's action can be used to best effect.

#### Legendary Actions and Scurry Away
The engineer uses standard legendary actions when he needs to make an escape or when his capabilities are being hindered. Should he remain in jeopardy after using all his legendary actions, he will use Scurry Away as a last resort.


#### Epic Chief Eldritch Engineer Battle

In this encounter, the engineer's tactics align with those detailed for vermin wheels. A notable advantage he has in vehicle such as the vermin wheel is that his Move legendary action allows him to ram targets with the wheel. If he can't reach a target this way, he'll rely on his Forbidden Augmentation legendary actions. 

While operating the vermin wheel, the engineer refrains from deploying any Forbidden Devices as actions. Instead, he channels all his eldritch power into the vehicle, biding his time until he's amassed sufficient power.

#### Power Conduits 
While a battle with these items present doesn't drastically alter the engineer's tactics, it does make him prioritize targets attempting to attack the conduits he's channeling.

### Eldritch Engineer Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk engineers is identifying what devices they're carrying still have any functional value.

In the case of the chief eldritch engineer, not only will he have the highest quality items for looting, but he will likely have magic items and other valuables that can be part of a treasure hoard, including its magic weapon, *storm demon*.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. If the identifying value materials the ratfolk was carrying will likely require an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check or a check using proficiency with appropriate tools, such as Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Alchemist's Supplies.


#### Eldritch Engineer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Ratfolk Weapons Operators

In the deep and twisted labyrinths of the underworld, where survival is a test of cunning and ambition, the ratfolk have harnessed deadly innovations in a bid to claim power. Among their ranks, a special caste stands out - the Weapon Operators. These ratfolk are not merely the handlers of their lethal creations, but ambitious individuals eager to rise through the societal ranks, driven by the intoxicating allure of power these weapons offer.

The Weapon Operators are chosen for their cunning and strength, but their selection is just as much a product of their own ruthless ambition. They yearn for the power the weapons represent, covet the respect and fear they command in their kin's eyes, and aspire to the elevated status these roles bring within their clan.

Operating the ratfolk's terrifying arsenal is a display of dominance and superiority, a tangible sign of their high-ranking position. Each use of their weapon reinforces their status, reminding all around them of the raw power they control. It is a potent mix of fear and respect, a heady cocktail that fuels their ambition and desire to rise even higher.

However, the confidence these weapons bring only lasts so long as the battle is going in their favor. Ratfolk weapon operators are quick to abandon their weapons to save their own skins.  Those ratfolk who stick with their weapon while frightened and on the backfoot are more likely to make panicked and desperate decisions with their weapon.

 This ironically puts them in more danger as they increase the risk of a devastating mishap. Conversely, if the ratfolk feel they have their enemy on the backfoot and victory is at hand, they may also engage in reckless use of their weapon as they become overconfident, leading them to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory as they cause an untimely mishap.

As such, the path of the Weapon Operator is perilous, laden with risks as volatile as the weapons they wield. Many ambitious ratfolk, lured by the promise of power, meet an untimely end, falling victim to the very weapons they hoped would be their salvation. The weapons do not discriminate between friend and foe; a minor miscalculation or a moment's inattention can lead to a catastrophic explosion, reducing the ambitious ratfolk to a cautionary tale.

Ratfolk who survive long enough eventually become veteran weapon operators. Having endured countless battles and weapon malfunctions, these ratfolk have developed faster reflexed and become substantially tougher than their less experienced kin. They have a more intuitive understanding of how to push the limits of their weapon and maximize its destructive potential while limiting the risks to themselves. However, despite their veteran status, these ratfolk still carry the same tendencies as the rest of their kin and utilize the same underhanded and often cowardly tactics.

### Ratfolk Weapons Operator Tactics

Ratfolk weapons operators embody the typical behavior of other ratfolk but are emboldened by their high-powered weaponry. When they have the upper hand, they can be unrelenting bullies, acting recklessly due to their perceived omnipotence, which often leads to their downfall. Conversely, when overpowered or outmatched, panic tends to trigger reckless and drastic decisions, usually resulting in their own demise and potentially that of their foes as well.

Their tactics will vary depending on the weapon they are wielding, but there are some general guidelines:
* When using Scurry Away, ratfolk have the option to either abandon their post by dropping their weapon and fleeing or carry out a panicked job, which involves a hasty attempt at either repairing or firing the weapon again.
* If both ratfolk on the weapons team are wounded and cornered, they will choose to do a panicked job, retreating while desperately attempting to fix or fire the weapon. A frantic weapons team might take whatever risks necessary to maximize the damage potential of their weapon, often to comedic effect.
* If one of the team members has fallen, or if the weapon is damaged (it has less than half its hit points left), the team will likely abandon its post.
* Ratfolk with the optional Panicked Driver trait will abandon their vehicles as soon as they become immobile.

Much of the weaponry and vehicles available to ratfolk present options for high-risk, high-reward tactics. Ratfolk typically take greater risks under two conditions:
* When they are desperate, such as when they are cornered or near death.
* When they have gained the upper hand, they often get overzealous and strive for maximum power, even when it appears unnecessary. 

However, they generally avoid taking risks when the outcome of a fight seems uncertain.

#### Ratfolk Veteran Weapon Operators
Ratfolk veteran weapon operators have survived numerous weapon malfunctions and developed quick reflexes. Their survival is largely due to these reflexes rather than any specific tactical or technical knowledge. This means they generally behave similarly to standard weapon operators.

### Weapon Operator Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk weapon operators is identifying which materials they're carrying that still have functional value.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. Identifying the value of materials the ratfolk was carrying will likely require an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check or a check using proficiency with appropriate tools, such as Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Alchemist's Supplies.


#### Weapon Operator Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Vermin Fiends
These demonic rat beings serve as the avatars of their verminous demon lord. They tower above mortals, their twisted forms a mixture of rat, human, and fiendish features. Their heads are topped with mighty horns, and the flesh peels away from their rat-like skulls, revealing bone etched with demonic sigils. Their long, muscular limbs can wield massive weaponry, yet they are dexterous and nimble with their movements, able to dash across the battle and swiftly dismember foes in the blink of an eye. When not taking action, vermin fiends are intensely twitchy and prone to pacing about with a rat-like restlessness.

Mortal ratfolk regard vermin fiends with a mixture of fear and reverence. They only summon these terrifying demons in the most significant of situations, such as when the machinations of their demon lord are in play. Vermin fiends always hold the highest position of authority amongst ratfolk, who show them grudging subservience. As instruments of their demon lord’s will, they serve to guide his mortal pawns and ensure his schemes come to pass.

Vermin fiends come in different variants, and the type of demon to step into the mortal world depends on its summoners and the needs of its verminous demon lord.

### Vermin Fiend Corrupter

These pestilent demons represent the virulent diseases unleashed into the world by their demonic rat lord. They are magical maladies shaped into a fiendish rat form, and where ever they roam, they leave plagues in their wake. They are most often summoned by those ratfolk who revel in disease and spreading sickness, and these vermin fiends consider it their sacred duty to <br> spread their master’s diseases across the mortal realm.

In combat, vermin fiend corrupters unleash a slew of pestilent magics capable of rotting away most foes before they can even reach the demon. Those who attempt to engage it in melee combat will find themselves assaulted by waves of biting parasites whittling away their vitality. The vermin fiend will then summon a pair of sickle blades to quickly dispatch its weakened and rotting enemies in short order.

### Vermin Fiend Deceiver
These devious demons represent their demonic rat lord's cunning and duplicitous nature. They are shadowy fiends whose size and power belies the stealth and subtlety with which they can move and act, always lurking out of sight until an opportunity presents itself. Vermin fiend deceivers are summoned when subtlety and guile are needed rather than conspicuous displays of force, and these cunning fiends manipulate enemy and ally alike to facilitate the schemes of their demon lord. They are most commonly served by assassin clans of ratfolk, and are supreme assassins themselves, able to stalk and slay even the most formidable and well-guarded of targets before disappearing into the shadows.

<br><br>

In combat, vermin fiend deceivers utilize stealth and misdirection to attack from unexpected directions and prevent enemies from surrounding them. They prefer to attack from a distance, utilizing a massive throwing star capable of cutting a swath through armored soldiers before flying back into the demon’s claws. When engaging in melee combat, the vermin fiend utilizes its deadly hexstiletto, a massive dagger the length of a man and capable of piercing through shield and armor alike.

### Vermin Fiend Warbringer

These brutal demons represent their demonic rat lord’s arrogance and ferocity. They are the most common and most warlike of the vermin fiends. Their awe-inspiring presence rallies the normally cowardly ratfolk and drives them into battle with bloody-minded ferocity. Warbringers revel in their effect on others, making dramatic entrances whenever possible and striking majestic poses before their followers. 

In battle, vermin fiend warbringers will often initially lead from the back, driving their minions into the fray. When it comes time for them to join combat, they wield mighty war glaives capable of cleaving through swaths of enemy soldiers. Should the vermin fiend fight a powerful foe, they will utilize a brutal spike-fist capable of inflicting horrendous wounds. These weapons are also useful for delivering underhanded strikes against already overwhelmed enemies. Regardless of the circumstances, when a warbringer slays a foe, it is always sure to do it in the most dramatic and gory way possible, leaving minions struck with awe and foes struck with terror.

### Vermin Fiend Hexseer

These scheming demons represent their demonic rat lord’s plotting and manipulative nature. While all vermin fiends scheme, hexseers carry out plots within plots within plots. All their actions serve to advance the inscrutable and long reaching schemes of their verminous master, and the world’s mortals are simply the tools through which they achieve their ends. They are most often summoned by other so-called “masterminds” among the ratfolk who serve the demonic rat god and require aid in carrying out his schemes.

Hexseers are aided in their plotting by the scryorbs they carry. These large crystal balls enable them to peer into a myriad of different futures and determine how each potential action can further their schemes. 

<br><br>

In dire circumstances, the hexseer can shatter the scryorb, unleashing all its mind-shattering knowledge at once. Creatures caught in its proximity will have their psyches torn apart as they are overwhelmed by the near-infinite possibilities they are suddenly exposed to.

However, these mighty fiends are rarely pushed to use such measures, for they wield arcane power beyond even their other vermin fiend kin. While all vermin fiends can channel magic, hexseers alone are capable of calling down bolts of arching lightning, hurling balls of fire, and unleashing earthquakes capable of leveling settlements.

# Example Ratfolk Encounters

## The Vermin Tide <br> (Player Levels: 2-3 or 6-8)
In this encounter, the players wander into the abandoned remains of a ruined town before swarms of rats and ratfolk begin emerging from the shadows to attempt to overrun them. There are two versions of this encounter; one for players in the level 2-3 range and one for players in the level 6-8 range.


### Encounter Context
This encounter doesn't need much setup and only assumes the players are wandering into the ruins of a town they haven't been to recently. Players with experience fighting rats or ratfolk will have better odds with the fight, but it isn't necessary. The players can enter the map from either area 7 or 8.

### Lead Up

The players wander into the remains of a dilapidated town that appears to have been recently abandoned. As they approach the town's market square, they spot dead guardsmen near a well. As they start to investigate the bodies or the area, the ratfolk attack.

### The Ratfolk Mobs
When the encounter begins, a group of random ratfolk will scurry out from a random location on the map. You can roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the players' Passive Perception (PP) to determine if the players are surprised or not. To determine what types of ratfolk appear, roll on the Ratfolk Mob table below. To determine where they appear, roll a d8 and match the result with the corresponding map location.

After this first ratfolk mob appears, roll on the Ratfolk Mobs table to determine the type of mob that will appear next, and then roll for the location where that mob will appear. This next mob appears 3 rounds later. Players within 30 feet of that location with a PP of 12 or greater can hear them coming the round before they appear. Players with a PP of 15 or higher can hear them from 60 feet away, and players with a PP of 18 or greater can hear them from anywhere on the map.

Repeat this process until 3 randomly generated ratfolk mobs have appeared. The final mob you roll for will accompany a second "boss mob" as the capstone to the fight, which enters from a different random location. For the level 2-3 version of the encounter, this will be a **ratfolk war vermin** who is the ratfolk leader. For the level 6-8 version of the encounter, it will be a **ratfolk chieftain**, who is the ratfolk leader, accompanied by 2 **ratfolk war vermin**. If the ratfolk leader is slain, all remaining ratfolk will lose their resolve and flee the battle.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>




### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The full moon casts the village in dim light. The building interiors are obscured in darkness.
* **Market Well.** The well in the market center is 30 feet deep. Attempting to climb out requires a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If a ratfolk falls down the well, remove it from combat unless it’s the chieftain or war vermin who show up in the last wave of the encounter. If it is one of these “boss” ratfolk, have it try to climb out of the well (no check required, though it still climbs at half its move speed).
* **Elevated Areas.**  The areas of the map highlighted in green are at a higher elevation than the ground floor of the market. The height difference is described in the map.
* **Cover Areas.** The areas of the map highlighted in yellow are locations the ratfolk may try to retreat to after using their Scurry Away feature. The tents provide half cover to creatures within them and are destroyed after taking 10 damage. A creature can make a DC 11 Strength check to knock a tent over. If a creature is inside a tent that’s been knocked over, it is blinded and moves at half speed until it leaves the tent or cuts its way out with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.

##### Ratfolk Mob Table
| 1d4  | Level 2-3 | Level 6-8 | 
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1 |  3 Ratfolk Warriors |  8 Ratfolk Warriors  |
|  2 | 5 Ratfolk Slaves |  4 Ratfolk War Vermin  | 
|  3 | 1 Ratfolk Warrior & 3 Ratfolk Slaves |  2 Ratfolk War Vermin & 6 Ratfolk Slaves  | 
|  4 | 2 Ratfolk Warriors & 1 Rat Swarm |  2 Groups of 8 Ratfolk Slaves, each appearing at a different location  |

### Encounter Tactics
The ratfolk fight using the same tactics outlined Ratfolk Encounter Guide. Ratfolk are likely to use their Scurry Away feature if they are fighting from a disadvantageous position, there is somewhere nearby they can hide, and there are nearby allies that make it difficult for them to be followed. If a ratfolk mob is near defeat but a new mob will be showing up soon, they are likely to use Scurry Away to attempt to survive long enough for reinforcements to arrive. However, they will not flee from the fight entirely until the ratfolk leader is killed or flees.

#### The Ratfolk Leader
The ratfolk leader, whether it be a war vermin or a chieftain, will use its minions as disposable cannon fodder to be thrown at the players and pin them down. It will then move in and attack anyone that looks weakened or overwhelmed. The leader is recklessly confident and is unlikely to flee unless it is reduced to a quarter of its health or less, or the majority of its minions are dead or near death, and the players still look like they're going strong.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Aftermath
If all the ratfolk are slain or flee, the players will no longer be in any immediate danger. If the leader escapes, it will likely try to rally a new force of ratfolk and exact its revenge against the players. Though this could take days or even weeks. Any remaining ratfolk in the town will likely flee the players on sight unless they appear vulnerable. If the players were forced to flee, the ratfolk will hound them until they have made it well outside the outskirts of the town.





#### Loot
If the players search the area for valuables, they'll find a chest full of coins the ratfolk were hoarding and a valuable items carried by the ratfolk. They can also loot the individual ratfolk they slew using the guidelines from the Ratfolk Loot Guide. The amount of treasure they find will depend on the level of the encounter.

##### Level 2-3 Encounter Loot
* **Chest:** 1,230 cp, 1,175 sp, 93 gp
* **Individual Ratfolk Minions:** 3 Potions of Healing
* **Ratfolk War Vermin:** Hex Gem worth 100gp
##### Level 6-8 Encounter Loot
* **Chest:** 6,032 cp,7,879 sp, 1,862 gp, 1,132 pp
* **Individual Ratfolk Minions:** 3 Potions of Greater Healing
* **Ratfolk Chieftain:** 1 Fractured Hex Jewel worth 500gp


> ##### Looting Potions During Combat
> You can give the players the opportunity to loot the healing potions from the ratfolk mobs during the battle. Each mob should have a potion carried by one of its ratfolk that the players can grab and use to heal themselves during the fight. This can allow the players to reduce the fight's difficulty if they are willing to expend part of their loot right away.

#### XP Award: 1,000xp (Level 2-3) or 7,000xp (Level 6-8)
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The majority of the ratfolk and their leader were slain
* **100% XP:** The player won the fight, but the leader or a larger number of ratfolk escaped
* **50% XP:** The players slew the majority of the ratfolk mobs, but retreated before being able to defeat the leader
* **10% XP:** The players were forced to retreat before defeating the majority of the ratfolk mobs


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Remove the second mob that accompanies the ratfolk leader's mob. Cut the XP award by roughly 20%.

**Harder Encounter.** Have a new mob appear each round after the ratfolk leader appears. These new mobs should contain roughly half the number of ratfolk as what's presented in the table. Boost the XP award by roughly 20%.

## The Ruinous Ritual <br> (Player Levels: 16-18)
In this encounter, the players face off against a ratfolk grey prophet performing a dark ritual to gain untold eldritch power. The seer is guarded by multiple ratfolk and protected by an arcane force shield that can only be dispelled by disabling three eldritch generators located across the map.


### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players are aware of the ratfolk grey prophet and the ritual he is performing in his underground lair. This encounter’s chamber may even serve as the final room of a dungeon where the players have been fighting their way through ratfolk to reach the grey prophet. 

### Lead Up
When the players arrive at the chamber, they will immediately see the grey prophet performing his dark ritual, surrounded by a magical force shield. The eldritch generators glow as their vile machinery whirls, and the players will see the energy they generate being siphoned to the grey prophet and his shield. You should make it clear to the players that the shield cannot be destroyed or dispelled through conventional means as it is being continually rejuvenated by the generators. Once the grey prophet and his ratfolk minions notice the players, they will immediately attack.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The green glow of the ritual and the eldritch engines illuminates the chamber with dim light. If the ritual ends, there will be no light source in the room.
* **Elevated Areas.**  The areas of the map highlighted in green are at a higher elevation than the ground floor of the chamber’s entrance. The height difference is described in the map.
* **Generators.** The generators are Large objects with 30 hit points, AC 18, immunity to psychic and poison damage, and resistance to all spell damage. Attacks against it made from 5 feet away have advantage. A creature within 5 feet of it can make a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check or an Intelligence check using tinker’s tools to disable a generator rather than destroy it.
* **Water.** The water in the champer is 10 feet deep and heavily polluted. Any creature that ends its turn in the water takes 3d6 poison damage.
* **Pipes.** The pipes crisscrossing the chamber have an AC 16 and immunity to psychic and poison damage. If 16 points of damage is dealt to a single section, it ruptures, filling a 10 foot area around it with the effects of the *cloudkill* spell for 1 minute (save DC 16). Once a section of pipe is burst this way, no pipes within 30 feet of it will produce this gas if they are destroyed.

##### Map Legend
* **C:** Ratfolk Council Guard 
* **G:** Eldritch Generator
* **P:** Ratfolk Toxic Wind Bombardier 
* **S:** Ratfolk Grey Prophet
* **V:** Ratfolk War Vermin

### Encounter Tactics
The goal of all the ratfolk in this fight is to kill or drive off the players while protecting the grey prophet’s ability to continue the ritual. Different ratfolk go about this in different ways, but they all answer to the grey prophet.

#### Ratfolk Grey Prophet
The grey prophet can’t move from his location while performing the ritual, but he can still direct the other ratfolk, cast spells, and use his other abilities. The grey prophet is intelligent enough that he can assess what types of saving throws each player will have a more difficult time dealing with, and will play on each player’s weaknesses whenever possible. 

##### Grey Prophet Tactic Tips
* Have him use *chain lightning* as soon as he can target three or more players with it.
* Have him use *fireball* if he can hit two or more players with it. He will deem hitting minions with a fireball acceptable so long as he’s hitting more players than minions and the players have low odds of passing Dexterity saving throws.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/4Kp08f0/The-Vermin-Ritual-Guide.png' style='position:absolute; top:70px; right:2px; width:415px; ' />


\pagebreakNum


* The *fissure* spell should be used following the same guidelines as the fireball spell, but only if it can be used without affecting an active generator. Any pipes in the fissure’s area are ruptured, and you can have the toxic water flow into the newly formed crevice if it makes sense.
* If the players are spread out, his Lightning Strike attack is usually his best option. Prioritize players surrounded by ratfolk to make use of the extra Overwhelming Mass damage.
* If a player reaches an active generator, that’s a good time to summon a rat tide to hinder that player.
* *Control winds* can be used to hinder player movement and keep them separated, so it’s harder for them to aid isolated and overwhelmed party members.

#### Council Guard and War Vermin
The grey prophet will squeak orders at the council guard in Undercommon throughout the fight. Two council guards are stationed at each generator. If the players split up, sending high-speed characters to quickly disable the generators, the grey prophet will order the council guard to leave their post and charge any fragile players that have been left exposed. This will be done in an attempt to force the other players to pull back to help their allies. If the players take a slower, more methodical approach, the council guard will hold their ground and wait for the players to come to them.
War vermin are more flexible in who and how they’ll fight and <br> will generally help gang up on any player engaged in <br> combat to help add to the damage of Overwhelming <br> Mass.

#### Toxic Wind Bombardiers
Bombardiers will keep their distance and attempt to whittle down players from afar, even if it means hitting a ratfolk or two in the process. They will only engage in melee with players who are fragile and poor hand-to-hand combatants.

#### The Generators are Destroyed
If all the generators are destroyed, the grey prophet will attempt to maintain his position by calling his remaining guards to protect him while he continues to bombard players from afar. If his platform ceases to be safe, or it’s clear he can’t defend it, he will break and flee. Spells like *control winds* and *fissure* can help hinder the players’ pursuit. Any remaining council guard will fight to the death to buy the grey prophet time to escape, but the rest of the ratfolk will break and begin fleeing once they see their leader making a run for it.


### Aftermath
If the players are forced to flee, the ratfolk won’t pursue them out of sight of the chamber. The grey prophet will continue his ritual, and it’s up to you how long it will take him to complete it and what the consequences are. The ritual might be minutes away from completion or hours. The completion of the ritual could result in a variety of deadly consequences, including, but not limited to:
* The grey prophet summons a vermin fiend
* The grey prophet gains the stats of a vermin fiend hexseer
* The grey prophet summons an army of ratfolk
* The grey prophet unleashes terrible disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, or meteor showers

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

If the players stop the ritual by destroying the eldritch generators but are forced to flee afterward, the grey prophet will have them repaired and attempt to restart the ritual. This will likely take at least a day, if not more, and the grey prophet may add extra safeguards, such as more minions, in case the players make a second attempt at stopping the ritual.
If the grey prophet is forced to flee, he will likely be foiled in his attempt to complete his ritual and begin plotting revenge against the players.

#### Loot
The players can salvage valuable arcane components from each of the generators. Each generator yields 2d6 x 1,000 gp worth of salvageable goods. If a character with proficiency in Arcana or tinker’s tools salvages a generator, they loot 3d6 x 1000 gp worth of salvageable goods instead. 

The grey prophet wears an eldritch amulet which served as the focal point for the ritual and is worth 10,000 gp.

As this was likely a climatic final battle part of a larger adventure, it is an opportune time to drop in any magic items appropriate to the players’ level that fit the environment or are useful to one or more of the players.

The players can also loot the individual ratfolk they slew using the guidelines from the Ratfolk Loot Guide.
