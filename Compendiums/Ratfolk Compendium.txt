# Ratfolk Compendium

These beautiful and treacherous environments are a staple in many fantasy adventures. Mountains can serve as imposing impediments to travel as players try to pass them to reach their destination, or they can be the location of the player's goal, serving as a dangerous and dramatic setting for an adventure. Even in the heart of relatively tame and civilized lands, mountains serve as bastions of untamed and unforgiving wilderness, for there are few environments that pose as many hazards to travelers.

This document provides content to help you run games that feature mountains of any shape and size in any environment. This content ranges from character options for players who want their characters to be associated with mountains, to mechanics for running sessions with travel through mountains, to a bestiary of mountain creatures to populate the peaks in your games. Whether the players are only spending a day traveling through mountains or your entire campaign features mountains, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

# Introducing Ratfolk

These devious and opportunistic humanoids scurry within the shadowy recesses of other civilizations, where they scheme ways to advance themselves and bring ruin upon their hated enemies.  And the enemies of a ratfolk are many, for most other humanoids view them with fear and disdain.  Thus, ratfolk live hidden within swamps, caves, sewers, or the ruins of other humanoids.  From here, they can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive.  
Some ratfolk find it in their best interest to bargain with and even form alliances with other races.  These alliances are almost always created out of a sense of survivalist pragmatism, and most ratfolk won't hesitate to cast them aside once they are no longer of use.  But some exceptional or desperate ratfolk will find themselves tangled in long-term partnerships with members of other races to achieve common goals.  These ratfolk are almost always adventurers of some sort and can make for useful and dangerous allies.

### Nimble and Devious
Though ratfolk possess natural agility and a vicious bite, they don't typically confront their foes head-on.  Their smaller frames and lack of resources have made ratfolk accustomed to fighting at a disadvantage.  As such, ratfolk rarely believe in fighting fair.  They are twitchy and quick to scurry away if they perceive themselves in a losing fight.  

Skilled ratfolk can use this natural tendency to their advantage as they whittle enemies down with hit and run tactics.  Ratfolk also become more confident when attacking in numbers and quickly become more vicious when they are part of a swarm overwhelming their foes.

If worst comes to worst and they are forced to flee, ratfolk can quickly squeeze their way into tight crevices to escape attackers.  This ability also gives them a substantial combat advantage when fighting in their claustrophobic underground homes, where they can pop from hidden alcoves to attack unsuspecting intruders.

### Bringers of Plague and Ruin
Most ratfolk live brutal lives in which pure survival is prioritized above all else.  The idea of shunning a source of power out of fear of corruption or avoiding tactics because they are dishonorable is absurd to them.  As such, ratfolk are known to be masters of many powers and abilities other races consider sinister.  Many ratfolk become deadly assassins, some possessing a supernatural mastery of their wicked craft.  Others tap into the notoriety of rats for swarming through civilization and spreading plagues.  These ratfolk may become carriers for terrible diseases which they can inflict upon their victims, or they may learn to command swarms of other vermin to overwhelm their foes.  Even ratfolk who pursue power through more conventional martial means utilize fear and underhanded tactics to obtain that power.

\columnbreak

### Crafty Innovators
In their scramble to find new ways to survive, many ratfolk find innovative ways to use the limited resources at their disposal.  These ratfolk make for natural tinkerers, artificers, and engineers, and their creations are built to deliver powerful results at any cost.  This mindset results in many brilliant but perilous designs.  The weapons created by ratfolk are often as dangerous to the wielder as the weapon's target.  Successful engineers have others test their devices for them, only using the most tried and true designs themselves.  

### Ratfolk Names
In some settings, ratfolk take names similar to those of nearby humanoids.  Other times, ratfolk develop naming conventions of their own.  First names are usually short, squeaky, and chittering.  Surnames emphasize imposing traits or deeds, and ratfolk often take on new surnames they find useful for maintaining their status.  Some ratfolk will even discard their first name altogether and only be referred to by an imposing title.  Ratfolk names generally don't distinguish between the genders.

# Running Ratfolk Adventures 

The nature of ratfolk and the names they go by varies from setting to setting. However, adventures that pit players against evil ratfolk usually feature them as unscrupulous and underhanded adversaries who utilize stealth and overwhelming numbers to compensate for other shortcomings. Ratfolk often dwell in formerly abandoned towns or the sewers of cities occupied by other humanoids. They may also construct their own hidden settlements underground or within deadly swamps. From these dwellings, they can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive.  

Players may come into conflict with ratfolk who are launching an attack on other humanoids, or they might stumble across ratfolk lairs in the wild or while exploring urban ruins. The most common types of ratfolk players are likely to encounter are foot soldiers, who range from lowly slaves to mighty warlords leading entire clans. Some ratfolk forces may also include a grey seer who serves as a powerful mystic and spiritual leader for the clan.

## General Ratfolk  Clans
TALK ABOUT THEM A BIT

### Ratfolk Motivations
Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. Many carry an everpresent sense of fear and inferiority and thus grab at power as a means of mitigating these insecurities. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk with specialized skills will seek mastery in that skill as a means of elevating themselves while also seeking to sabotage any rivals. 

Lowly ratfolk slaves will leap at any chance to bully another creature, and ratfolk warlords seek to expand the size of their territory and clan. All ratfolk take particular glee in seeing the works of rival races reduced to ruin and will bring about such ruin for its own sake as it facilitates a sense of superiority amongs their kind.



Ratfolk with more mystical inclinations, such as grey seers, may appear to give up this selfish drive in service of their divine calling, but they, too, seek power. Their service is merely a means of gaining access to eldritch powers, which they can use to elevate themselves amongst their clan, and they often walk the fine line between doing what their divine masters require of them and utilizing their gifts to achieve their selfish ends.



#### General Ratfolk Motivations
* Securing resources or territory for a clan
* Bringing ruin upon a feared enemy
* Acquiring items that enhance the ratfolk’s power or can serve as a status symbol
* Increasing status among the clan
* Avoiding the wrath of higher-ranking clan members

\columnbreak

#### Grey Seer Motivations
* Serving the will of an otherworldly master
* Securing eldritch lore or powerful magic items
* Gaining influence over other clans
 


### Ratfolk Tactics
Ratfolk rarely have the advantage over their foes in terms of individual power and must instead rely upon cunning and numbers. Grand strategic goals are pursued using deception, betrayal, and securing large numbers of allies. Ratfolk are opportunistic schemers by nature and can flip from cowering hesitation to brutal aggression the moment they see an opening to pursue their goals. Though ratfolk are quick to backstab one another to pursue their ends, they naturally unite into overwhelming verminous mobs when faced with an outside threat. These tactics carry over into how ratfolk engage the players in combat.

#### Engagement
Ratfolk rarely engage enemies on anything approaching even footing. They don’t start a fight unless they’ve caught the players off-guard, have overwhelming numbers, or have a terrain advantage. If they’re able, ratfolk will surround the players before making their presence known using their natural stealthiness. They will also try to fight in dark and claustrophobic environments where their darkvision and Crevice Crawler abilities allow them to sneak up from unexpected directions.


#### Combat

So long as they believe they have the upper hand, ratfolk are vicious combatants to the point of recklessness. They will dogpile an isolated or otherwise vulnerable opponent and utilize their Overwhelming Mass feature to rack up brutal amounts of damage. If the players manage to regroup to support whoever is being ganged up on, the ratfolk will scatter using their Scurry Away feature before rallying to reattempt the same tactic. Fighting in an environment with tight spaces the players can’t easily move through helps facilitate this fighting style.

#### Retreat
Ratfolk aren’t shy about retreating if a fight doesn’t appear to be going well. If ratfolk force as a whole is doing well, individual ratfolk will often fight to the death. However, their morale plummets once they no longer perceive themselves as having the upper hand. This may happen if the ratfolk lose more than half their fighting force or their leader is slain, and their enemies don’t appear to be near defeat. Under these circumstances, most ratfolk will flee if they have lost at least half their health, face a foe they don’t outnumber, or see multiple nearby allies flee.

## Ninja Ratfolk Clans

The nature of ratfolk and the names they go by varies from setting to setting. However, adventures that pit players against evil ratfolk with ninja-like capabilities usually feature them as unscrupulous and underhanded adversaries who utilize speed, stealth, and agility to catch players off-guard and exploit their weaknesses. These ninja ratfolk dwell within secret lairs or hidden dispersed amongst larger populations where they can better remain hidden. 

Players may come into conflict with ninja ratfolk who are launching raids on other humanoids or performing sinister covert operations. Players may be called upon to foil a ninja clan’s attempts at assassination, theft, espionage, or sabotage. They may also be sent to hunt down ninja ratfolk or discover the whereabouts of their masters or the location of their clan’s lair.


### Ninja Ratfolk Motivations


Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk of the ninja clans see obtaining mastery of their deadly arts as the most reliable means of obtaining power and elevating their status. Mastery and status are obtained by carrying out missions on behalf of their clan or whoever is paying for their services. As such, most of their motivations will be tied to carrying out whatever task has been assigned to them. Individuals within the clan may have their own personal agendas, but should they be caught crossing the clan, they will be quickly eliminated.

#### Ninja Ratfolk Motivations
* Carrying out missions on behalf of their clan
* Seeking esoteric knowledge, training, or items to help further the mastery of their art
* Ascending through the ranks of their clan
* Finding formidable challenges to overcome, so as to prove their worth
* Acquiring secrets that can be leveraged for power

### Ninja Ratfolk Tactics
Ninja ratfolk utilize cunning, stealth, and ruthless opportunism to achieve their goals. These tactics apply to both grand strategic goals and moment-to-moment combat maneuvers. They are never obvious about their intentions or how they plan to achieve their ends, and these ratfolk almost always have a trick up their sleeve or some contingency plan to fall back on should they face challenging resistance.

\columnbreak

#### Engagement

Ninja ratfolk never engage enemies on fair terms and will always look to strike when and where they are least expected. They usually avoid fights where they can’t dictate how the battle is started and almost always attempt to begin engagements with an ambush. Attacking players under cover of darkness is their preferred method. Still, they may also hide their agents amongst other ratfolk forces and only reveal themselves once the players have left one of their more vulnerable party members open to a sneak attack. 

Ratfolk ninjas also enjoy attacking players who are engaged with other foes, making it much easier to sneak up on unsuspecting party members. If the players manage to catch them on the back foot, most ratfolk ninjas will attempt to retreat and regroup for a surprise counterattack when the players are more vulnerable.


#### Combat

Ratfolk ninjas all make heavy use of hit-and-run tactics. They rarely stand toe-to-toe with formidable opponents and prefer to focus their attacks on players who are easy to hit and quick to bring down. Their high mobility and ability to disengage from fights make it hard for players to pin them down and easy for them to reach fragile players. 

Beyond these skirmishing strategies, ratfolk ninjas still make use of their standard racial abilities. They attack in groups whenever possible, enabling both their sneak attacks and their Overwhelming Mass ability. Scurry Away and Crevice Crawler also make retreat into tight spaces where players cannot follow all the easier.

#### Retreat
Ninja ratfolk quickly flee if they find themselves on the back foot, and many of their strategies involve retreating from surprise attacks the moment the players have had the chance to gain their bearings. The fact that they can use their Cunning Action feature while frightened as a result of their Scurry Away feature helps facilitate this. 

They will leave the players wounded with their resources drained and wait to strike again when their guard is down to slowly sap the players of their fighting capability. If the players manage to deal severe damage to the ratfolk ninja force and successful counterattacks seem unlikely, they will flee the area entirely. 

Though ninja ratfolk are quick to flee, those who have ascended beyond the rank of night runner rarely due so with the blind panic of ordinary ratfolk. Their disciplined training allows them to maintain a level head, and their retreats are made in a much more tactical manner.

# New Player Options
Bleep blee blah blah blah

<Br><br><br><br><Br><br>

## New Race: Ratfolk
You can use these stats for a ratfolk player race option.

### Ratfolk Traits
Your ratfolk has the following racial traits.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and one other ability score of your choice increases by 1.

***Age.*** Ratfolk mature quickly and usually live brutally short lives.  They reach adulthood at 8 and have a natural lifespan of 40 years, though most don't even live half that long.

***Alignment.*** The cutthroat nature of ratfolk society results in them leaning heavily towards chaos over order.  Their emphasis on survival at all costs pulls ratfolk towards neutrality, if not outright evil, though exceptional individuals may push back against this. 



***Size.*** Ratfolk are usually shorter and scrawnier than the average human.  Adult ratfolk usually reach 4 to 5 feet in height and weigh 70 to 110 pounds, with exceptionally well-fed individuals reaching 6 feet and weighing as much as 160 pounds.  Most ratfolk walk with a hunch, making them appear shorter.  Your size is Medium.

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet

***Darkvision.*** You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light.  You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray. 

***Crevice Crawler.*** You can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than you without squeezing.

***Bite.*** Your razor-sharp jaws are a natural weapon you can use to make unarmed strikes.  If you hit with them, you deal piercing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice) instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.  You can also use Dexterity instead of Strength for the attack rolls you make with your bite.

***Overwhelming Swarm.***  When you damage a target with an attack or a spell, you can cause the attack or spell to deal an extra 1d4 damage for each of your allies within 5 feet of the target that isn't incapacitated.  You can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.  Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

At 5th level, the damage dice change to d6s.  At 10th level, they become d8s.  At 15th level, they become d10s.  And at 20th level, they become d12s.

***Scurry Away.*** When a creature you can see ends its turn, you can move up to half your speed away from it as a reaction, and you become frightened of it until the end of your next turn.  This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.  While frightened this way, you can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action.  This ability ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

***Verminous Instincts.*** You gain proficiency in Perception. 

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Undercommon.

### Ratfolk Adventurers
Most settings do not feature ratfolk, let alone playable ratfolk.  However, the DM and some players in the group may want the opportunity to try playing such a character without needing to shoehorn an entire race into the world.  In this case, the following options can provide some possible origins for ratfolk individuals in settings otherwise devoid of them:

##### Ratfolk Adventurer Orgins
| d10  | Adventurer Origin |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | One of your parents was a wererat, leaving you born with bizarre ratlike traits. |
|  2  | Your attempt at curing yourself of your wererat lycanthropy left you trapped in a hybrid rat-humanoid state.   |
|  3  | You were once an ordinary rat living in a town subjected to a dark curse, causing its rodent population to mutate into humanoids and overrun its former inhabitants. |
|  4  | You were once a lab rat used in a twisted project to mutate and rapidly evolve rodents.  You were one of the first successes.  |
|  5  |You were testing an experimental new form of teleportation but didn't notice the rat with you.  When you both finished your journey, you had fused into a single entity. |
|  6  | You were once the familiar of a powerful and reclusive archmage.  Tired of having one-way conversations with you, the mage transformed you into an intelligent humanoid.   |

|  7  | You betrayed the secrets of a powerful fey, who devised an ironic way of punishing you for "ratting" them out. |
|  8  | You stole a cursed item crafted with a unique way of punishing "thieving rats."  |
|  9  |You serve an otherworldly being strongly associated with rats and vermin, and this being has chosen to "bless" you with its gifts. |
|  10  |A powerful magical individual with delusions of godhood is attempting to craft a new race of verminous worshippers, and you are one of the first members of this fledgling species. |

## New Ratfolk Feats

### Cunning Crafter

* Increase your Dexterity or Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You can use your action to perform object interactions and use magic items while frightened by your Scurry Away trait.

\pagebreak

### Devious Adversary
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>

You've practiced scurrying in and out of combat and dispatching foes in underhanded ways, granting you the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength or Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* When you use your Scurry Away trait on a creature within 5 feet of you, you may choose to make a bite attack with disadvantage against that creature as part of the same reaction before you move.
* When a creature you have been frightened of by your Scurry Away feature since the start of your last turn misses an attack against you, any fear you have of that creature ends. You may then use your reaction to move up to half your speed towards it.  If this movement brings you within 5 feet of the creature, or you were already within 5 feet of it, you may make a bite attack against it with advantage as part of your reaction.



### Hordemaster
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>

You’ve learned how to summon and command hordes of rats to devour your foes, granting you the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* As an action, you can summon a number of **giant rats** equal to your proficiency bonus, which appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within 30 feet of you.  The summoned rats are friendly to you and your companions.  In combat, the rats share your initiative count, but they each take their turns immediately after yours in any order you choose.  
On each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to command any of the rats within 30 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one).  You decide what action the rats will take and where they will move during their next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular area or run up and attack a specific creature.  
If you issue no commands, they can move and use their reaction on their own, but the only action they take on their turn is the Dodge action.  Once given an order, the rats continue to follow it until their task is complete or they end their turn more than 30 feet away from you.  Each rat disappears after it drops to 0 hit points, after 10 minutes have passed, or you use this feature to summon more rats.  
Once you summon rats this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher.  When you summon rats this way, you create a number of rats equal to twice the level of the spell slot expended.

This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the rat can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

### Plague Rat
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>

Your body is riddled with diseases that perversely grant you vitality while also allowing your bites to inflict debilitating infections, thus granting you the following benefits:
* Increase your Constitution or Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with your bite attack, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or become infected by your disease.  While it is diseased, whenever the infected creature makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.  The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the disease on a success.  Once a creature is cured of the disease, or it succeeds on saving throw against the disease, it can't become infected by this disease again for 24 hours.

### Tail Master
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>
You've trained your tail coordination to the point where you can use it like a third hand.  You may use your tail to perform actions you would normally need a free hand for.  Your tail can wield simple weapons with the light property, but no other types of weapons and no shields.  When you take an attack action while wielding a weapon with your tail, you may make an additional off-hand attack, allowing you a maximum of two off-hand attacks.

### Under Speaker
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>
You've learned how to communicate with your fellow rodents, keeping you well informed by a vast network of verminous spies and granting you the following benefits:


\columnbreak


* Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain the ability to cast the *beast sense* and *speak with animals*, but only as rituals and only targeting rats.  The spells' spell casting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

* You can cast *animal friendship* and *animal messenger*, but only targeting rats.  Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can't cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest.  You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level.  The spells' spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.

### Unrivalled Killer
*Prerequisite : Ratfolk Race*<Br>
You know how best to capitalize on any opening left by your opponent, granting you the following benefits:
* Increase your Dexterity or Wisdom score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You learn the *true strike* cantrip. You can cast it without somatic components, and Wisdom is your spellcasting ability when casting it. You can cast this spell even while you are frightened by your Scurry Away trait. If an attack that was granted advantage by the spell hits, you can use your Overwhelming Swarm trait even if you have no uses of the feature left, and doing so does not expend any uses of it.
* When you use your Overwhelming Swarm feature against a creature that can't see you, you gain the maximum number of additional damage dice possibly granted by that feature, regardless of the number of allies within 5 feet of your target.

## New Items
These are new items.

### Plague Censers

These insidious weapons have the appearance of a ceremonial censer used for burning incense, but they are shaped into the form of a flail.  Each day, a plague censor can be filled with toxic incense, and as the censor is swung in combat, it unleashes necrotic fumes deadly to all in the vicinity, including the wielder.    


#### Plague Censer
*melee weapon (martial, flail)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d8
- **Damage Type:** Bludgeoning
- **Properties:** Heavy, two-handed, reach, special
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___

***Plague Censor.*** When you make an attack with a plague censer, it releases its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.  Each creature in that area takes 1d6 necrotic damage, including the wielder.  Once a plague censer releases its putrid incense, it can't do so again until the next round.

The plague censer must be filled every 24 hours with 10gp worth of putrid incense to maintain this trait.



#### Feat: Plague Censer Fanatic
You've learned how to develop a supernatural bond with a plague censor, drawing perverse fortitude from it even as you are withered by its toxic fumes, and you can use this bond as a focus for your magical abilities.   You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with plague censers.

*  As long as you are wielding a plague censer containing putrid incense, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and you can perform the somatic components of spells even when it is occupying both your hands.

* When you cast a spell that has somatic components using your plague censer as your spellcasting focus, you may have it release its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.

* When you release putrid incense from a plague censer you are wielding, you may have it deal 1d8 necrotic damage rather than 1d6.

* When you take necrotic damage from a plague censer you are wielding, you get +2 to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you stop wielding the plague censor in both hands.

### Poisoned Wind Globes

#### Poisoned Wind Globes
___
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Poisoned wind globes are orbs made of glass or crystal and filled with deadly gas. When shattered, the spheres release billowing toxic clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.

\pagebreakNum

#### Death Globes
___
- **Cost:** 100 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Death globes are built with the same function as poisoned wind globes, but the gasses they carry are far more potent and capable of enveloping a much larger area.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 10-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.

\columnbreak

#### Poisoned Wind Globe & Death Globe Upgrades

These effects can be added to poisoned wind globes or death globes to enhance their lethality. The cost of the globe is increased by 100 gold per upgrade added. If they're added to the globes used ratfolk poisoned wind globadiers or ratfolk death globe bombardiers, their CR goes up by 1 per <br>upgrade applied to their globes.

* **Acid Blast.** When the orb shatters at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the orb's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (This orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

* **Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the orb deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

* **Warp Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the orb, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

#### New Feat: Poisoned Wind Fumigator
You've become a master of crafting and utilizing poisoned wind globes to maximum effect, and you can even implement globes with gases specialized in poisoning creatures normally resistant or immune to such effects. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kit, or glassblower's tools

* You may have the saving throw for a poisoned wind globe or death globe you throw become 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, and you may add your Intelligence modifier to the poison damage its gas cloud deals.

* At the end of each long rest, choose a creature type other than construct. Creatures of the chosen creature type don't benefit from resistance or immunity to poison damage from poisoned wind globes and death globes you throw unless they are under the effect of the *protection from poison* spell.

* If you are proficient with glassblowers tools and either alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kits, and you have them in hand, you can create a new poisoned wind globe from the remains of one that has shattered within the last hour. To do so, you must expend 25 gp worth of alchemist's supplies or poisons over the course of 1 minute to turn the shattered globe into a new poisoned wind globe. 


\pagebreakNum

### Spike Fists
These vicious weapons are gauntlets, bracers, or metal knuckle rings fitted with one or more metal spikes or blades. They are used by brutal warriors who specialize in setting up cheap shots and attacking opponents when they are most vulnerable.

#### Spike Fist
*melee weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d4
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** light, special
- **Cost:** 5 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
___
***Spike Fist.***  When you hit with an attack with this weapon that had advantage, its damage increases to 2d4 piercing damage.



#### Feat: Spike Fist Brutalist
You've mastered the underhanded tactics necessary to brutalize your foes with spike fists, granting you the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with spike fists.

* Attacks you make with spike fists deal 1d6 piercing damage or 2d6 piercing damage if they have advantage.

* When you make a spike fist attack with advantage, you can forgo advantage for that roll to increase the damage you deal to 4d6 piercing damage if you hit.




### Things Catchers
This two-handed polearm has a large, tong-like head with the inside of its grips lined with spikes. The weapon is designed to be thrust around the torsos and extremities of foes to grab and painfully subdue them.

#### Things Catcher
*melee weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d4
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** reach, special, two-handed
- **Cost:** 2 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___
***Things Catcher.***  A large or smaller creature you hit with a things catcher is automatically grappled by you. Until the grapple ends, you can't attack any other targets with the things catcher. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice), freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. If a creature has multiple attacks with the Attack action, it can replace any number of them with these checks. The grapple also ends if you drop the things catcher.

\columnbreak

#### Feat: Things Wrangler
You developed the abilities needed to wield things catchers in more versatile ways and make them more difficult to escape from, granting you the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with things catchers.

* You treat things catchers as though they have the versatile property, dealing 1d6 piercing damage with two hands and 1 piercing damage with one hand.

* You can use two-weapon fighting while wielding a things catcher as long as one of the weapons you are wielding is light.

* You may have the grapple escape DC of a things catcher you are wielding be 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

### Throwing Stars

These small, sharpened metal stars can be thrown or used as a stabbing weapon to deal small amounts of damage and potentially deliver poisoned attacks.  Their small size and unassuming nature make them ideal concealed weapons.


#### Throwing Star
*ranged weapon (simple)*
___
- **Damage:** 1
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Finesse, light, thrown(20/60), special
- **Cost:** 5 sp
- **Weight:** 1/10 lb
___

***Throwing Star.*** You can use two-weapon fighting to make off-hand attacks with throwing stars as though they are melee weapons, and you can use throwing stars to make melee weapon attacks as though they are light melee weapons. However, you still have disadvantage on these attack rolls if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and isn't incapacitated. 

#### Feat: Throwing Star Master
You mastered the art of using the normally unassuming throwing star to disrupt your foes and set up brutal follow-on attacks, granting you the following benefits:  

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with throwing stars.

* You can draw a throwing star as part of the attack you make with it.

* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using a throwing star that did not suffer from disadvantage, you can gain advantage on the next melee weapon attack or unarmed strike you make against that creature this turn.

## New Spells
These are new spells

### Lore of Vermin
There are a wide variety of ratfolk across <br> various fantasy settings, all with their <br> own unique abilities and interpretations <br> of the rat trope.  However, there are <br> many common themes across these <br> varied ratfolk, especially when it <br> comes to the form their magic <br> typically takes.  Many ratfolk utilize magic that <br> plays into their reliance on stealth and cunning. <br>  When this fails, and they are backed into a <br> corner, ratfolk may use magic to drive their <br> allies into a desperate self-destructive frenzy. <br>  They also favor magic that emphasizes their <br> kinship with rats and other verminous <br> creatures.  And in settings where ratfolk <br> are more sinister in nature, they often <br> wield dark magic that helps them bring <br> disease and ruin upon other civilizations.


#### Death Frenzy

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sharp tooth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You send a creature into a frenzy that pushes its body beyond its limits. Choose a willing creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, it takes 1d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and has advantage on weapon and unarmed strike attack rolls until that turn ends. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Fissure
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S,
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Druid
___

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt out from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long.  The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep.  If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure.  Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side it moves to. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The fissure deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with it when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the length by 20 feet and its depth by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

#### Summon Swarm
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded cage worth at least 300 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You call forth a swarm of tiny creatures that manifest in <br> an unoccupied space you can see within range.  This <br> swarm uses the Swarm Spirit stat block*.  When you cast <br> the spell, choose a type of creature: Bats, Insects, Rats, or Snakes.  The creatures of the swarm resemble the chosen creature, which determines some of its traits in its stat <br> block.  The swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points <br> or when the spell ends.

The swarm is an ally to you and your companions.  In combat, the swarm shares your initiative count, but it <br> takes its turn immediately after yours.  It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don’t issue <br> any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, use the higher level wherever the spell's level appears in the stat block.  Additionally, increase the swarm's size by one category for every two slot levels above 3rd level.

**Stat blocks found later in document*

#### World Sore
*1st-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You cause a boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see.  The boil occupies a 5-foot sphere centered on the chosen space.  The surface where a boil appears must be wide enough to accommodate its size.

The boil has AC 10, 20 hit points, immunity to psychic damage, and vulnerability to piercing damage.  When reduced to 0 hit points, it explodes into puss, and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Dexterity save.  Creatures take 1d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

On each of your turns, while you are within 100 feet of the boil and can see it, you can use your bonus action to either cause the boil to explode, as described above, or grow it.  Growing it increases its radius by 5 feet, increases the damage it deals when it blows up by 1d8, and extends the range of its explosion by 5 feet.  If there is no room for the boil to expand when you attempt to grow it, which includes being blocked by a creature, it remains its current size and explodes instead.  
The boil immediately explodes when the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage when the boil explodes increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

> ***Poison Fangs.*** The first time each turn that the swarm hits a creature with a weapon attack, that creature must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take additional poison damage equal to the spell’s level and be poisoned until the start of its next turn.
>
> ***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a tiny creature. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes a number of attacks equal to half this spell’s level (rounded down).
> 
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4d6 or 2d6 piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.

> ##### Alternative Swarms
> The names of the swarm stat blocks represent suggested descriptions for the type of animal likely to have the abilities of that stat block.  However, you're free to describe the swarms as being composed of different creatures that might have similar abilities.  For example, the swarm of bats could alternately be described as a swarm of biting locusts.

- **Components:** S, M (a moth wing)
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:** Druid, Wizard, Warlock
___

You cause a whirlwind of vile smoke and stinging ashes to rush up at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 20-foot radius of that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and loses any darkvision it has until the end of its next turn. On a successful save,  a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its darkvision.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. The spell also snuffs out any non-magical fire in its area.


***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Brittle Bones

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become brittle for the duration. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

After you end your movement, you may immediately take the hide action as part of this bonus action. The smoke lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.  

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can move an additional 15 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

The next time the coated object deals piercing or slashing damage to a creature during the spell’s duration, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned this way can repeat the Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

# Two-Creature Weapons Teams
Some weapons are so massive they require two creatures to move and operate them effectively. These weapons may be oversized firearms, large incendiary devices, or unwieldy melee weapons such as large drills. Though they come in many forms, they have a few common traits: they require two creatures to operate, they can be moved without hindrance by two creatures, and they must be loaded with some form of fuel and ammunition on a regular basis to be fired.

## Two-Creature Weapon Rules
Two-creature weapons require at least two creatures to operate them, and they come with the following additional rules considerations:


### The Weapons Team
The two creatures operating a two-creature weapon are known as the weapons team. The weapons team consists of a leader and a follower. Only one creature can be assigned to each role, and they cannot switch roles once assigned, even if one of the roles becomes vacant, unless they leave the weapons team and rejoin.

#### Joining a Weapons Team

Joining a two-creature weapons team costs a creature's action and half of its movement as it equips its part of the weapon. If one creature is already part of the weapons team, it may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature joining the team. Leaving a weapon team requires no action as the creature drops its part of the weapon.

A creature must have both hands available to be on a weapons team and can't pick anything else up without dropping its part of the weapon.

The creatures within a weapons team must stay within 5 feet of each other and the weapon at all times. If one of them is ever more than 5 feet away from the weapon or the other team member, it is no longer part of the team. 

#### Moving Two-Creature Weapons
The follower can no longer move on its turn except to leave the weapons team. The leader's speed becomes equal to the lowest speed among the creatures on the weapons team. Whenever the leader moves, it can choose to move the follower along with it if the follower is willing, even when the leader is moved against its will. 

#### Stealth
While part of a weapons team, a creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, activating a two-creature weapon reveals the weapons team's location if they are hidden.



### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/pRGXM8s/orchish-cannonade.png' style='position:absolute; top:-35px; right:0px; width:817px;' />

## Two-Creature <br> Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning two-creature weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, weapons can have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by creatures on their weapons teams. The Load and Crank functions <br> can be activated by the follower, and the Fire <br> function can be activated by the leader. Each <br> function can only be activated once per round. 

#### Load
This function is used by the follower to reload <br> the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. <br> It requires the follower to have immediate <br> access to the weapon's ammunition, and <br> creatures can use their reaction to make <br> opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits <br> the follower this way, it drops the ammo and <br> wastes its action.

#### Crank
Not all weapons have this function. If a weapon <br> does, it must be activated by the follower before <br> each use of the Fire function to move the ammo <br> or fuel through the weapon.

#### Fire
The function is activated by the leader to fire the <br> weapon. When this function is activated, but before <br> its effect occurs, roll to see if a Mishap occurs.

\columnbreak



 If a Mishap occurs, its effects happen before the effects of the Fire. This function can't be used if the weapon is out of ammo or if the weapon has a Crank function that hasn't been used since the weapon was last loaded or fired.

### Mishaps
Mishaps represent the weapon experiencing a significant malfunction. There is always a risk of this when firing the weapon, and some weapons have other circumstances that risk a mishap. Whenever this risk occurs, roll a d6. On a result of 1, a Mishap occurs, and the creature who triggered it must roll on the weapon's Mishap Table to determine the nature of this malfunction (see the Mishap Table section).

If the weapon has less than half its hit points, roll 2d6 and take the lowest result when checking for a mishap. 

Unless stated otherwise, you must always check for a mishap when activating the Fire function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Most weapons have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways their functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishap Table.

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Ratfolk Two-Creature Weapons
Though two-creature weapons teams are deployed by many races with the technological know-how to craft such weapons, ratfolk are among the most prolific users of such weaponry. This may be due to the combination of their technical capabilities, their willingness to take on the risks such weapons pose, and the seemingly never-ending amount of weapons designs their mad engineers concoct. Though these weapons can be hazardous to their users, ratfolk are never shy about accepting such risks if it means getting the opportunity to obliterate foes with overwhelming firepower. 

The ever-opportunistic ratfolk often mass-produce their most popular designs and sell their inventions to the highest bidder. They will often make more potent versions of these weapons as well. These masterwork variations gain sinister nicknames as their dreaded reputation builds, and they are reserved for use by the most prestigious clients of the ratfolk engineers.


### Poisoned Wind Mortars
This fiendish artillery piece is an amalgamation of primitive engineering and unholy alchemy, a stark representation of the Ratfolk's cunning adaptability. Crudely crafted from rusting iron and scavenged metals, its appearance belies the terror it inflicts. It's not merely the brutish launch mechanism of a traditional mortar that warrants fear, but the horrific payload it delivers.

At the heart of this weapon lies the poisoned wind - a deadly concoction of the most lethal substances the Ratfolk have extracted from their underworld environment, or synthesized through their arcane and toxic alchemy. Sealed within fragile orbs of glass, this gas waits with malevolent potential for release.

When the poisoned wind mortar fires, these spheres arc high through the air, shattering on impact and spreading their malignant payload: a green, ethereal miasma that sickens, corrodes, and eventually kills those who inhale it. Armor tarnishes and rots, flesh sears and boils, and the very life-force is choked out of those caught within the cloud. The sight of this deathly fog approaching not only brings physical destruction but also instills terror, often breaking the morale of the enemy before the cloud even reaches them.

The Death Mortar Globe shatters at the point

#### Poisoned Wind Mortar Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a poisoned wind mortar. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Acid Blast.** When the weapon's ammo shatter at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the weapon's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (The orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

**Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the weapon's ammo deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

**Warp Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the weapon's ammo, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

#### Poisoned Wind Mortar Tactics
Poisoned wind mortars function as artillery and excel in providing area denial and obscuring the enemies' vision. This tactic proves highly effective when ratfolk forces need to reposition, surprise their enemies, blind opposing ranged attackers, or force them to move. Due to the delicate nature of their ammunition, Poisoned Wind Mortar teams will use their Scurry Away feature to quickly escape whenever an enemy approaches melee range. 

The upgrades for poisoned wind mortars don't alter their tactics but instead enhance their effectiveness in their existing roles.

### Ratling Guns
A paradoxical fusion of crude engineering and subtle brilliance, the ratling gun is a testament to the ratfolk's knack for invention. Built from scavenged metals, timeworn wood, and the odd mysterious alloys they mine from the depths, this rapid-fire weapon is a sight to behold. It is composed of multiple rotating barrels, each capable of spitting out a hail of deadly ammunition at a terrifying rate.

The ammunition is unique to the ratfolk, handcrafted in the underbelly of their world. A mixture of sharp metal shards, stolen and scavenged munitions, and occasional nuggets of strange underworld minerals, all are melted down and recast into thousands of wicked, serrated projectiles.

This action can be repeated up to 6 times, with each shot consuming additional ammunition. The action ceases if there is no remaining ammo. 
<br>For each shot fired, the team leader must roll to determine if a mishap occurs. For each shot fired after the first one, the leader must roll a d6 for each shot fired this turn when checking for a mishap (2d6 for the second shot, 3d6 for the third, etc.) If a mishap occurs for any given shot is fired, that mishap must be resolved before more shots can be taken.
<br> The chosen target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw for each time it has been targeted. For each failed save, the target suffers 13 (2d12) piercing damage and an additional 7 (2d6) radiant damage.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

When activated, the ratling gun roars to life, its barrels spinning in a lethal whirl. In seconds, it can transform a tranquil landscape into a storm of flying metal, shredding through ranks of foes like a scythe through wheat. The very sight and sound of the ratling gun is enough to break the morale of many a foe, a rapid, deafening symbol of the ratfolk's ferocity.


Yet, the ratling gun is not without its flaws. It is a volatile and unpredictable weapon. Overheating is common, leading to disastrous explosions that harm friend and foe alike. The ammunition, while plentiful, is inconsistent, causing unpredictable trajectories and often requiring a significant volume of fire to be effective.

#### Ratling Gun Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a ratling gun. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Ratling Coolant.** When rolling to check for a mishap with the weapon, you can choose to disregard one of the d6s you roll (if you're only rolling 1d6, you can negate the need to roll.) If the weapon incurs damage that reduces its hit points to half or less, or if a mishap occurs, the coolant bursts. The burst coolant forces each creature within a 10-foot radius of the weapon to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, suffering 22 (5d8) cold damage on a failed save and half as much on a successful one. The coolant burst is resolved prior to any Mishaps that triggered this event. Once the coolant bursts, the weapon loses this ability until it fully regains its hit points.

**Hemorrhaging Shots.** Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire function, it sustains a wound. At the end of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage per wound. A creature can have multiple wounds simultaneously. Wounds can be healed if the creature regains 10 or more hit points, or if a use of a healer's kit is expended on it. Alternatively, the wounded creature or another creature within 5 feet can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check check against the weapon's DC as an action, ending all wounds on a success.

**On-Board Ammo Assembler.** When the follower is using the weapon's Load function, they can choose to salvage parts from an unmanned two-creature weapon or vehicle with a CR of 3 or higher within 5 feet, provided it has at least 30 hit points. Doing so inflicts 30 damage to the salvaged weapon or vehicle. If this reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is dismantled and cannot be used for further salvaging. The follower gains a special ammo belt made from the salvaged parts that lasts for one minute. While using this ammo, the weapon deals an additional 13 (2d12) damage with its Fire function, but the function triggers a Mishap on a roll of 1 or 2 when using this ammo.

#### Ratling Gun Tactics
The ratling gun represents the epitome of risk-reward weaponry, with its potential to eliminate virtually any target, be it swarms of enemies or a single formidable creature. Its primary targets are foes with heavy armor and low dexterity.

As long as the fight is progressing favorably, weapons teams typically start by firing two rounds per turn. However, when victory is within grasp or defeat is imminent, the rate of fire escalates. In extreme panic or power-driven frenzy, teams fire as many rounds as possible.

##### Ratling Gun Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Ratling Coolant.** This safety upgrade gives weapons teams the confidence to fire three shots per turn instead of the usual two, as long as the coolant is active.

**Hemorrhaging Shots.** With this upgrade, the team is more likely to distribute their shots across multiple targets to inflict bleeding. If there's a creature effectively healing the wounds, they will focus their fire on that target, often risking more rounds per turn to eliminate it.

**On-Board Ammo Assembler.** Encounters involving multiple ratling guns with this upgrade can be interesting. The guns are encouraged to be more reckless, firing more shots per turn. If one of the guns experiences a malfunction, the team abandons it, and the remaining ratling gun teams cannibalize its parts. The increased mishap rate from the newly acquired scrap bullets means they can deliver devastating damage but with higher misfire risks. When the weapons misfire and become disabled, they contribute more scrap for the remaining ratling guns.

### Warpfire Throwers

Constructed from rusted metal, corroded pipes, and bizarrely vibrant crystals mined from the deep earth, the warpfire thrower is as terrifying as it is crude. It is a deceptively simple device, consisting of a large, cumbersome tank filled with a mysterious, volatile substance, connected to a projecting nozzle manipulated by its ratfolk wielder.

This enigmatic liquid, known only as "warpfire", is a product of the ratfolk's arcane knowledge and alchemical prowess. Glowing with an eerie, otherworldly light, it is said to be the physical manifestation of raw, chaotic energy harnessed and condensed. When unleashed, the warpfire clings to anything it touches, searing and consuming it with unnatural, green flames.

When the warpfire thrower is fired, a torrent of this deadly warpfire is expelled, engulfing everything in its path. The very air seems to warp and ripple around it, and the heat it generates is so intense it can melt through steel and stone alike. The sight of this horrifying green firestorm is often enough to break the will of even the most hardened warriors.

However, the warpfire thrower is a perilous weapon, even to its handlers. The warpfire is highly volatile and unpredictable, and any misstep, any fault in the device, can result in catastrophic backlashes. It's not uncommon for the thrower to explode in a ball of warpfire, consuming the ratfolk operator and those unfortunate enough to be nearby.

#### Warpfire Thrower Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warpfire thrower. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Self-Destruct Mechanism.** The team follower may use their bonus action to activate the weapon's self-destruction sequence. At the end of that creature's next turn, the weapon is destroyed in an explosion, and every creature within 30 feet of it is subjected to the weapon's Fire function.

**Motorized Pumps.** Each time the warpfire thrower is cranked, it gains a level of heat that lasts until the weapon goes one full round without being cranked. If the safety protocol is overridden, the warpfire thrower gains two levels of heat. The warpfire thrower's Fire function deals an additional 4 (1d8) fire damage for each level of heat, and when checking for a mishap, a mishap occurs if the number rolled on a d6 is equal to or less than the current heat level.

**Warp Napalm.** If a creature or a flammable object fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire function, it ignites. Until an action is taken to douse the fire, the target suffers 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

\columnbreak

#### Warpfire Thrower Tactics
Warpfire throwers are designed to target the largest clustered group of enemies during a battle, but they always maintain a safe distance of at least 5 feet from any opponents. The weapons team will override its safety protocol whenever doing so allows them to hit two or more additional enemies. This strategy is also employed in moments of panic or when the team feels they have the upper hand.

##### Warpfire Thrower Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Self-Destruct Mechanism.** This upgrade perfectly aligns with ratfolk tactics. Whenever the situation becomes even slightly precarious, the team will activate the self-destruct mechanism and immediately abandon their post to avoid the ensuing explosion.

**Motorized Pumps.**  As the heat builds up and becomes unstoppable, the weapon becomes incredibly dangerous. Consequently, the ratfolk operating this weapon tend to be more reckless than other teams.

**Warp Napalm.** his weapon is best suited for a hit-and-run strategy. Ratfolk are more likely to utilize their Scurry Away feature with this weapon, forcing creatures that have failed their saving throws to decide between extinguishing the flames or using their Dash actions to chase after the weapons team. The team should prioritize setting as many creatures ablaze as possible rather than focusing on one particular group.

### Warp Grinders
Fashioned from an eerie blend of scavenged metals, ancient stone, and uncanny, glowing crystals found only in the deepest crevices of the underworld, the warp grinder stands as a testament to the ratfolk's dark intellect. It consists of a pair of interlocked, spiral-shaped drills, powered by the raw, volatile energy housed within the strange crystals.

These drills, when activated, spin at tremendous speed, tearing through rock, metal, and even magic-enhanced barriers with alarming ease. They produce a chilling, grinding noise that haunts the tunnels, a sound as unnerving as the sight of the green, flickering energy that arcs around the device's tips. When put into overdrive, the device is capable of tearing apart huge swaths of earth and foes alike with the thunderous roar of its whirring drill.

The warp grinder's primary function is that of an unhindered excavator. With its pair of interlocked, spiraling drills spinning at astonishing speed, the device can burrow through the toughest of materials with ease. This ability is exploited by the ratfolk to quickly create new tunnels and pathways in the underground labyrinth they call home. Using the Warp Grinder, they can swiftly approach their unsuspecting enemies from unexpected directions, launching devastating ambushes that often turn the tide of battle in their favor.

In the realm of siege warfare, the warp grinder is equally menacing. It can quickly undermine defensive walls, chew through gatehouses, and reduce towers to rubble, making short work of even the most formidable fortifications. When faced with a barrier, whether physical or magical, the ratfolk operators merely rev up the Warp Grinder and let it do its terrifying work. In a matter of moments, once impregnable defenses crumble, sowing chaos among the defenders and paving the way for the ratfolk's vicious onslaught.

#### Warp Grinder Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warp grinder. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.


**Seismic Snare.** When a creature fails the saving throw against the weapon's Fire function and is standing on earth or stone, it becomes buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature is restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a Strength check against the weapon's DC. This check has advantage if the creature making it has a burrow speed.

**Emboldening Fumes.** When the Fire function is used, each creature that is part of the weapons team gains 10 temporary hit points at the end of the turn. While a creature has these temporary hit points, it is poisoned and immune to being frightened or charmed. A creature immune to the poisoned condition cannot gain these temporary hit points. If the weapon's safety protocol has been overridden, the team gains 20 temporary hit points instead. If the weapon has a Mishap, they gain 30 temporary hit points instead.

**Warp-Quake.** Whenever a creature fails its saving throw against the weapon's Fire function while standing on difficult terrain created by any warp-grinder within the last minute, it takes an extra 13(2d12) plus 9(2d8) thunder damage.

#### Warp Grinder Tactics

The warp grinder weapons teams expertly lead ratfolk in subterranean ambushes and serve as formidable shock troopers.

The warp grinder should be part of preplanned ambush teams, bursting from the ground to surprise enemies. However, the emergence point might be slightly random due to the difficulty of pinpoint precision during emergence. Note that the tunnels may require Medium creatures to squeeze through for traversal, except for ratfolk, who can easily navigate them with their Crevice Crawler feature.


\columnbreak

To determine if the warp grinder surprises enemies, have the weapons team carrying it perform Stealth checks. The team should override the safety protocol to move at maximum speed just before reaching the surface, preventing enemies from preparing for battle if they notice the incoming attack.

Upon surfacing, the team targets the nearest high-armor and low-dexterity enemy with the weapons Fire ability. If they can hit multiple targets without causing too much harm to friendly forces, they will override the safety protocol and use the area-of-effect version of the Fire ability. This will provide advantage to attacking allies if the targets are knocked prone. The difficult terrain created by this ability can also facilitate escape or hinder enemy reinforcements.

The burrowing ability remains useful even after surfacing. It allows the weapons team to move through the difficult terrain they create, avoid movement penalties, dig underground to dodge ranged attacks, and escape against Medium-sized creatures more easily.

##### Warp Grinder Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Seismic Snare.** This upgrade enhances the warp grinder's debuffing capability, making it an excellent choice when teaming up with groups of ratfolk.

**Emboldening Fumes.** This upgrade empowers the warp grinder to be far more daring. Those affected by the fumes will never flee from battle.

**Warp-Quake.** This upgrade turns the team into masters of area denial. The safety protocol should be overridden whenever this feature is used. If there are no targets on difficult terrain, the team should spend its turn spreading as much difficult terrain as possible.

### Warplock Jezzails
Crafted from a crude amalgamation of scavenged metal, timeworn wood, and luminescent crystals of chaotic energy mined from the deepest corners of the underworld, the warplock jezzail is a weapon of chilling potency. It is an exceptionally long, large-bore firearm, reinforced with metal bands and an elaborate shielding mechanism for the operator.

The ammunition it fires is nothing short of terrifying. Each bullet is a small shard of the same eerie crystal that powers the warplock jezzail, carrying a piece of raw, volatile energy within. When fired, these bullets blaze a path through the air, leaving an eerie, glowing trail before they impact with devastating force, capable of penetrating the thickest armor.

With its range and power, the warplock jezzail is an unmatched weapon of assassination and long-range warfare. The ratfolk snipers, perched high atop their subterranean cliffs or hidden in the labyrinthine tunnels, can lay low powerful adversaries from an immense distance, their presence often only revealed by the greenish streak of a successful kill.

However, the warplock jezzail is as dangerous to its operator as it is to its targets. The raw energy within the ammunition and the firearm itself is volatile and unstable. A jammed bullet, a malfunctioning firing mechanism, or simply overuse can lead to disastrous explosions, often fatally wounding the wielder and those around them.

#### Warplock Jezzail Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warplock jezzail. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Rat-Eye Scopes.** At the end of the team leader's turn, if they have not moved, they can choose to take aim at a creature within 400 feet that they can see. The leader maintains its aim at the target until the leader moves, or the leader can no longer see the target, or the target moves more than 400 feet away from the team leader. While the leader maintains this aim, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against the weapon's Fire function.

**Sniper Jezzail.** A creature doesn't have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while part of the weapons team, and creatures on the weapons team can traverse or halt in a space large enough to accommodate an object one size smaller than themselves without squeezing. Additionally, using the weapon doesn't reveal the weapons team's position to other creatures they are more than 30 feet away from.

**Embedding Rounds.** When a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire ability, the bullet embeds in the target for one minute. While embedded, the creature cannot regain hit points, and at the end of each of its turns, it takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage. The target creature or another creature within 5 feet can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check, attempting to extract the bullet. The target creature has disadvantage on this check if it attempts to remove the bullet from itself. On a successful check, the bullet is removed; however, on a failed check, the creature suffers 10 (3d6) radiant damage.

#### Warplock Jezzail Tactics
These weapons teams serve as snipers and prioritize targeting enemies with high armor and low dexterity. They swiftly retreat when confronted in melee combat.

#### Warplock Jezzail Upgrade Tactics 
&emsp;**Rat-Eye Scopes.** This upgrade enhances the warplock jezzail's sniping capabilities. The weapons team must be defended by other creatures to make effective use of this upgrade. If the team isn't near death, their weapon remains operational, and their target is still within range and appears vulnerable, they will continue firing despite sources of disadvantage. 

**Sniper Jezzail.** This upgrade allows the warplock jezzail to carry out ambushes in places where other weapons can't. If the team uses the Scurry Away feature, they'll take their time to run until they can become hidden again before resuming fire.

**Embedding Rounds.** While the team will still prioritize hitting low-dexterity targets, with this upgrade, they will focus on isolated targets that are unable to receive assistance in removing the bullets.

### Two-Creature Weapon Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these weapons are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Two-Creature Weapon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

The Basic Weapon Loot Table should be used for the standard version of any of the two-creature weapons in this document. The Advanced Weapon Table should be used for the more powerful variant of any of the weapons.

##### Basic Weapon Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-6  | 1 5gp Item & 1d6(3) 5sp Items |

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

\pagebreakNum



### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

\columnbreak

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Warp Lightning Cannons
The warp lightning wannon is a massive, wheeled contraption that bristles with crackling energy. Constructed from a combination of scavenged metal and mysterious components, the cannons are powered by a rare and volatile energy source harnessed from the raw forces of chaos. Ratfolk engineers channel this energy into the cannon's twisted mechanisms, preparing it to unleash its devastating power.

When activated, the warp lightning cannon fires lethal bolts of crackling, coruscating energy. These electrifying projectiles surge forth, capable of piercing through the toughest armor and obliterating enemy formations with explosive force. The destructive potential of the warp lightning cannon is unmatched, making it a prized asset in the ratfolk's arsenal of war machines.

However, its power is not easily controlled, and warp lightning cannons are as dangerous to their operators as they are to their enemies. The unleashed energy often surges uncontrollably, causing catastrophic feedback that can result in explosions or the cannon tearing itself apart. Only the most skilled and daring ratfolk engineers dare to operate these deadly devices, often as a testament to their ambition and thirst for power.

The ratfolk clans jealously guard the secrets of creating and operating warp lightning cannons, considering them a potent symbol of their supremacy and a means to assert dominance over their rivals. Despite the best efforts of the ratfolk, warp lightning cannons do occasionally fall into the hands of their rivals, who are quick to modify them for their own uses in war. When brought to bear on the battlefield, the eerie glow of the cannon's energy casts a chilling pall over friend and foe alike, foretelling the chaos and destruction to come.

### Warp Lightning Cannon Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warp lightning cannon. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

* **Warp Conduit.** When a creature makes a saving throw against the cannon's Fire function due to being in the area of its lightning, all other creatures within 5 feet of that creature must also make the saving throw against the effect as the electricity arcs between them. This arcing causes the original creature, and everyone the lightning arced to, to suffer disadvantage on their saving throws.
* **Regenerating Radiation.** When a creature preps or loads the cannon, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, it gains a level of exhaustion and regains 15 hit points. A creature immune to exhaustion cannot gain hit points this way.
* **Warpstone Dynamos.** The cannon no longer experiences mishaps when rolling for the length of its lightning blast. Instead, when the cannon rolls for the length of the line, it gains a charge for each 4 rolled on a d4 that lasts one minute. The cannon deals an additional 4 (1d8) damage per charge it has. However, if the weapon ever gains 4 or more charges, it suffers the Energy Overload Mishap. This mishap causes the cannon to take 71 (8d8) + 35 lightning damage and lose all its charges. If reduced to 0 hit points this way, the cannon experiences the Meltdown mishap.

### Warp Lightning Cannon Tactics

The warp lightning cannon serves as a powerful piece of artillery. Unlike many other artillery pieces, it fires in a straight line, which means that allied troops in front of it must clear a path for its lightning blast. Alternatively, the crew can choose to fire through expendable allies to reach prime enemy targets. Bogging down foes in such allies can be an effective way to ensure they can't escape the cannon's blasts.

#### Warp Lightning Cannon Upgrade Tactics

**Warp Conduit.** This upgrade is particularly useful when there are many expendable units on the front line. These additional bodies can be utilized to impose disadvantage on enemies' saving throws by triggering the arcing lightning effect.

**Regenerating Radiation.** This upgrade works best with expendable, less capable creatures working the cannon, as it keeps them alive but limits their combat effectiveness. However, its usefulness diminishes when the crew is more proficient in combat, as engaging with foes directly can be used as a last resort if the cannon becomes inoperable for some reason.

**Warpstone Dynamos.** This upgrade turns the weapon into a truly chaotic device. The predictability of its operations can be drastically reduced, leading to unforeseen outcomes on the battlefield.

# Self-Propelled Vehicles
Most land vehicles in fantasy settings are pulled by other creatures, such as wagons, carriages, or chariots. However, through some combination of technology or magic, some vehicles may be self-propelled and driven by a passenger. These may be relatively small mechanical contraptions, magically self-propelled carriages, or mighty war machines rumbling across blasted battlefields. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these vehicle types in your games. They can be applied to vehicles of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own vehicles. The rules here can be applied to most self-powered vehicles piloted by a passenger. 

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Rules
Self-propelled vehicles are vehicles able to move without needing to be pushed or pulled by another creature, and they usually don’t need an external energy source (such as wind). Throughout this document, they will be referred to simply as vehicles. Creatures within a vehicle are referred to as passengers. 
In combat, vehicles use most of the same rules as creatures, with the following additional considerations:

### Opportunity Attacks
Vehicles provoke opportunity attacks as usual. When a vehicle provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle itself or any creature riding on or inside it, provided they are within reach and do not have total cover.

### Spacing Within Vehicles
All creatures within a vehicle count as being within 5 feet of each other.

### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Entering or exiting the vehicle costs a creature half of its movement. Each creature inside the vehicle may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting.

### Crashing into Creatures and Objects
A vehicle can crash into a creature or object by entering its space. When it does, the creature or object must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice) using the vehicle's DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved in a straight line before attempting to enter the target's space (maximum 20d6 damage).

If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage and is not knocked prone. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the vehicle's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. A target can only make this saving throw once per turn.

If the vehicle is at least two size categories larger than the target it crashed into, it can continue moving through the target's space if it has any movement remaining. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop. If the target is an impassable object that could reasonably damage the vehicle, such as an iron wall, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6 damage). Each creature on or inside the vehicle takes the damage as well

### Prone Vehicles
If vehicle falls prone, it cannot right itself and is incapacitated until it is flipped upright.

### Falling Vehicles
When a vehicle falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position. If the vehicle falls due to the actions of its driver (such as jumping off a ramp) it may not land prone (DM’s discretion) but still takes fall damage.



### Repairing Vehicles
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
Certain circumstances can cause a vehicle to malfunction and eventually break down due to wear and tear. This wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion rules, as described in Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with the following modifications:

* When a vehicle reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
* The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a vehicle is through repair. This can be done using the rules described in the Repairing Vehicles section above. If the attempt to repair the vehicle succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle's exhaustion level remains unchanged, but the repair attempt can be made again using the same tools and replacement parts.


\pagebreakNum

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these vehicles have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A vehicle's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a vehicle's hit points reach 0, it becomes inoperative and is irreparably damaged.
### Damage Threshold
Most vehicles possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A vehicle with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the vehicle takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the vehicle's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the vehicle's hit points.
### Mishap Threshold
When a vehicle sustains damage from a single source that is equal to or exceeds its mishap threshold, it is required to roll on the Mishaps table (refer to the Mishaps section).
### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the vehicle comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the vehicle.
### Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity indicates the maximum weight of cargo the vehicle can carry.
### Vehicle DC 
Whenever the vehicle requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.
### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.
### Ability Scores 
A vehicle possesses the standard six ability scores that creatures have, along with their corresponding modifiers. The Strength of the vehicle is determined by its size and weight, while Dexterity represents its handling and maneuverability. The Constitution of a vehicle reflects its durability and quality of construction. In most cases, vehicles have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a vehicle has a score of 0 in a particular ability score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that relies on that score.

### Action Stations
A vehicle may have one or more Action Stations. Each of these stations requires a certain number of creatures to operate and may grant those creatures some amount of cover. The creatures operating these stations must be passengers within the vehicle, but not all passengers need to be operating a station. A creature operating a station can use an action to activate the station's effect. A station can be occupied by only one creature at a time and can only be activated once per round. 

#### The Helm 
Most vehicles that must be piloted by a passenger (referred to as the driver) have an Action Station known as the Helm, where the vehicle's movement is controlled. It usually consists of a chair equipped with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. If a vehicle has a helm with no one operating it, it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver who is proficient with land vehicles can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

The driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring it to a complete stop. While the vehicle is in motion, the driver can steer it along any desired course. If the driver becomes incapacitated, leaves the helm, or takes no action to alter the vehicle's course and speed, the vehicle will continue moving in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it collides with an obstacle large enough to stop its movement.


### Mishaps
Most vehicles have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways its functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishaps Table. 

To resolve a Mishap, a creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (refer to the Mishaps section). If the vehicle is moving, the check is made with disadvantage. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for the repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Doom Flayers
The doom flayers are imposing contraptions, reminiscent of giant, twisted cogs that screech and grind as they surge forward. Propelled by their spinning wheels, the vehicles possess incredible speed, allowing them to swiftly close in on their foes, leaving chaos and destruction in their wake.

Mounted on each doom flayer is a skilled ratfolk driver, operating the complex controls and piloting the vehicle with unmatched precision. The doom flayers are often deployed in the vanguard of ratfolk armies, charging into enemy lines with ruthless efficiency. 



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br>

 Armed with gnashing blades and deadly weapons, they eagerly carve a path through enemy ranks, dismembering all who dare stand in their way.

However, despite their formidable strength, the doom flayers are not without their risks. The unstable combination of engineering and sorcery makes them unpredictable, and accidents or malfunctions can result in catastrophic consequences, claiming the lives of both their operators and enemies alike.

##### Doom Flayer Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Tunnel Raiders:** A ratfolk clan has begun deploying doom flayer riders to terrorize underground settlements, raid them for supplies, and weaken their defenses in preparation for larger attacks. The vehicles surge through the tunnels, leaving destruction in their wake. The adventurers have been hired to put a stop to this menace.|
|  2  |**Death Derby:** A powerful and eccentric artificer has issued a challenge to ratfolk engineers and sorcerers from all clans, inviting them to participate in a deadly race where they must pilot doom flayers to claim a legendary prize. The adventurers are drawn into this competition, facing off against other participants in a perilous race through treacherous tunnels and ruins. |
|  3 | **Blades For Sale:** A ratfolk engineer living in a scrapyard has started piecing together warp flayers and selling them to criminal gangs. The adventurers are tasked with finding where these deadly vehicles are coming from and putting a stop to their distribution.|
|  4  |**The Vermin Riders:** A gang of doom flayer riding ratfolk led by a warlock engineer is raiding the countryside, constantly looking for fuel and upgrades for their deadly vehicles. The players are tasked with tracking them down and putting a stop to their rampage. |


### Doom Flayer Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a Doom Flayer. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Armour-Shredding Blades.** When a creature is rammed by the doom flayer and fails the saving throw against the effect, any armor the creature is wearing is damaged and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. A creature can remove the -1 penalty from the armor over an hour if it has the appropriate tools and proficiency with them (blacksmith tools or leatherworker's tools, depending on the armor).

**Black Hole Reactor.** A crew member at the doom flayer's helm can use their action to activate its Black Hole Reactor. If they do so, they can use half of their movement to immediately exit the doom flayer, allowing the doom flayer to move in a straight line up to its movement speed after they do so. At the start of the creature's next turn, the doom flayer is destroyed, and each creature within 15 feet must make a DC Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, creatures take 9 (2d8) force damage for every 10 feet the doom flayer moved in a straight line during the last round. If this damage reduces the target to 20 hit points or fewer and they failed the saving throw, they are banished to another plane of existence at the DM's choice.

**Repelling Knife-Blades.** At the end of a crew member's turn, if the doom flayer moved 20 feet or more that turn, ranged attacks against the doom flayer and its crew have disadvantage until the end of that crew member's next turn.



\pagebreakNum

### Doom Flayer Tactics

Doom flayers function as hard-hitting chariots for ratfolk armies, lingering along enemy flanks until they identify a vulnerable target, then charging in to slice up their victims. Their ratfolk drivers typically use the Scurry Away trait to avoid counterattacks, driving to a safe distance before returning for another charge.

#### Doom Flayer Upgrade Tactics

&emsp;**Armour-Shredding Blades.** Pilots of doom flayers with this upgrade will specifically target armored enemies.

**Black Hole Reactor.** If the battle isn't going in the ratfolk's favor, it can activate the Black Hole Reactor as a last-ditch gambit. Note that even on the turn the ratfolk abandons the vehicle, the unmanned vehicle can still be used to crash into a target as it drives in a straight line toward its destination before detonating.

**Repelling Knife-Blades.** With this upgrade, the doom flayer's driver no longer needs to fear the repercussions of entering within range of heavy ranged fire. This makes the doom flayer perfect for harassing enemies with such attacks.

### Doom Flayer Weapon Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from this vehicle are materials salvaged from its remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Two-Creature Weapon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

The Basic Weapon Loot Table should be used for the standard version of any of the two-creature weapons in this document. The Advanced Weapon Table should be used for the more powerful variant of any of the weapons.

## Doom Wheels

In the sprawling laboratories of the ratfolk, technological and magical prowess intertwine in frenetic chaos. Amidst this interplay, one invention stands as a testament to the insanity and genius of the ratfolk engineers - the doom wheel.

The doom wheel is an immense vehicle that looms over the battlefield like a nightmarish mockery of a rat wheel, a testament to the raw and unbridled power the ratfolk engineers can command. An engineer, picked from the most daring (or unhinged) of their kind, steers the doom wheel from a pilot seat within, guiding this deadly contraption with mad glee, careening wildly across the landscape.

The doom wheel’s motion is powered by an army of irradiated rats, feverishly running in unison along the inside of its massive. Dangerous arcane stones built into the machine mutate and transform these rats into tireless, monstrous variants of their kin, their muscles bulging with unnatural strength and their eyes glowing an eerie green. The ceaseless running of these mutant rats drives the huge wheel, causing it to spin with a relentless, unstoppable momentum.

But the arcane stones serve a dual purpose. As the wheel spins, it generates a kind of eldritch energy, harnessed by the embedded stone. The magical mineral, imbued with the raw force of movement, channels this power into devastating blasts of arcane lightning. This energy is unleashed upon the ratfolk’s enemies in brilliant, lethal arcs, turning the doom wheel into a rolling generator of destructive force.

> ***Skittering Lightning.*** Whenever the doom wheel finishes moving at least 10 feet, a bolt of lightning leaps to the closest creature within 60 feet of the doom wheel and not inside it. That creature must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) lightning damage for every 10 feet the doom wheel moved on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one (maximum 20d6). If two or more potential targets are equidistant from the doom wheel, choose one at random.

>
> ***Treadmill (Requires 1 Large swarm of Tiny creatures as Crew and Three-Quarters cover).*** The swarm powers the doom wheel, causing the doom wheel’s speed to become equal to the swarm’s speed until the start of the swarm’s next turn. The swarm cannot steer the doom wheel, and if no one uses the Helm’s action before the start of the swarm’s next turn, at the start of the swarm’s next turn, the doom wheel moves its speed forward in a straight line before its speed drops back to 0.

### Warp Flame Wheel

Instead of generating devastating arcs of lightning, this doom wheel variant channels its eldritch energy into an infernal pyrotechnic display. At the heart of the wheel, an eldritch furnace glows with an unholy intensity. Fueled by the sheer kinetic force of the running rats, the furnace channels its blazing wrath into gouts of horrifying, green-tinged flame that consumes all in its path. This fire, hotter and more potent than any natural flame, reduces enemies to ash and the battlefield to a scorched wasteland.

However, the warp flame wheel's destructive potential doesn't end there, for it is equipped with a high-pressure sprayer loaded with a sticky, highly flammable oil. At the pilot's command, this oil can be sprayed over adversaries or across the battlefield. Then, with a malicious grin, the engineer ignites the oil-soaked area with the eldritch fire, turning it into a nightmarish sea of flame.

### Wheel of Kill-Doom

When the mad ratfolk engineers set their minds to outdo themselves, they do so with a level of fanaticism that defies comprehension. Born of such fervor is the pinnacle of their insane genius, a terrifying machine imbued with unstable destructive power: The Wheel of Kill-Doom.

The Wheel of Kill-Doom represents the zenith of ratfolk engineering prowess, an evolved doom wheel that is the ultimate fusion of the most potent arcane technology and the highest-grade parts scavenged, stolen, or "ingeniously acquired” by ratfolk. The structure of the Wheel of Kill-Doom is reinforced with arcane steel designed to make it hardier and amplify the machine’s unnatural power.

Every nook and cranny of this monolithic machine boasts meticulous attention to detail, from the titanium-bolted joints to the arcane-etched gears. In a significant upgrade from the original doom wheel, the Wheel of Kill-Doom is equipped with additional lightning generators. These devices, powered by the relentless running of the strongest irradiated rats, generate lightning of a potency unseen in its predecessor. This energy coalesces into brilliant, crackling bolts that can arc between multiple foes, leaving a trail of charred bodies and scorched earth. The spectacle of the Wheel of Kill-Doom in action is nothing short of a storm let loose on the battlefield.

### Doom Wheel Loot
Because doom wheels are vehicles, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are items they were carrying or materials salvaged from their remains. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks or may not require a check to spot at all. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Doom Wheel Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Doom Wheel Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-13  | 2d4(5) 50gp Items |
|  14-24 | 2d4(5) 100gp Items | 
|  25+ | 3d4(7) 100gp Items  |

|  19-23 |  4d6(14) 200gp Items |  
|  24+ |  5d6(17) 200gp Items |  

#### Example Doom Wheel Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.

##### Example Doom Wheel Item Names

### Doom Wheel Tactics

Due to the doom wheel's erratic nature and propensity for malfunctioning, its tactics are limited. However, there are a few key considerations to keep in mind:

* The lightning generated by the doom wheel strikes the closest target that is not inside the wheel. This means it must have a clear path to its intended target, avoiding any allies if present, and should strive to end its movement as close as possible to the target.
* The rats inside the wheel will continue turning it even if the driver dies, causing the wheel to keep moving in its current direction.

#### Warp Flame Wheel Tactics
* The warp flame wheel’s pilot always begins by using Vermin Grease to accelerate the wheel to maximum ramming speed and extend the range of its flamethrower. 
* The pilot may prioritize setting the grease on fire or hitting as many targets as possible with the flamethrower. A helpful rule of thumb is to count setting the grease on fire as equivalent to hitting two targets with the flamethrower. 
* The Flame Siphon ability can help sustain the rats in the Treadmill. If the rats' speed decreases due to being at half health or lower, focus on passing the wheel through the fire until they regain enough health to increase their speed, even if it means temporarily reducing your damage output.

#### Wheel of Kill-Doom Tactics
* The tactics remain the same as the normal doom wheel, with the only new feature being that the lightning bolt it generates has the ability to jump to another target. Find two enemies close together to avoid the seconded bolt jumping to any allies.
