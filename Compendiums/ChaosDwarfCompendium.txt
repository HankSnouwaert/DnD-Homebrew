# Chaos Dwarves Compendium

These tyrants are a malevolent and brutal race of dwarves whose souls have been twisted by dark forces, transforming them into ruthless beings driven by greed and a desire for dominion. Unlike their noble kin, they have wholly embraced the chaotic energies that permeate their existence, using these arcane powers to reshape their bodies and minds in pursuit of their sinister goals. The Chaos Dwarves' descent into darkness is marked not only by their wicked actions, but also by their grotesque appearance, with blackened, gnarled features and twisted, horn-like protrusions that serve as a constant reminder of their fall from grace.

In the varied worlds that they inhabit, chaos dwarves are often found dwelling in the deepest, most inhospitable regions, where they construct formidable citadels and forge sinister alliances with other denizens of darkness. Fueled by their insatiable ambition, they engage in relentless conquests, enslaving the weak and crushing those who dare to defy their will. Their society is structured around an ironclad hierarchy, with the most powerful sorcerer-priests at its apex, guiding their kin with an unyielding grip. Chaos Dwarves possess a unique blend of potent magic and technological prowess, making them a formidable force to be reckoned with on any battlefield.


## Running Chaos Dwarf Encounters
The setting you’re running your adventures in will help determine the background of this dwarven race and the specifics of their lore. In some settings, they may be twisted by the forces of chaos into malevolent beings. If your setting has a cosmology aligned with more classical D&D settings, these dwarves will likely align themselves with devils, given that they share a lawful evil and tyrannical nature. 

### Chaos Dwarf Motivations and Adventure Setups

Regardless of the lore and setting specifics, these dwarves are defined by their conquering industrialist nature. Players could encounter and come into conflict with chaos dwarves under many types of circumstances. You can use the following table as inspiration for ways to introduce chaos dwarves into your campaign:

### Roleplaying Chaos Dwarves

Chaos dwarves are ambitious power seekers, always looking to advance themselves above others. They view other races with contempt, seeing their kind as superior to all others. Chaos dwarves meeting the players will either see them as a means to an end or as obstacles to be destroyed. They may be willing to trade with the players, but if the players are aligned with forces opposed to the interest of the chaos dwarves or their masters, they will likely turn on the players before long.  

Consider these traits when playing on the decisions and behavior of chaos dwarves. They are not reckless barbarians, but calculating tyrants, always looking for that chance to further their machinations, enhance their wealth, or advance in power. That said, they still value loyalty to their masters, and though they scheme and plot their way up through their hierarchies, chaos dwarves will carry out their assigned duties without question. For it is through this loyalty and cold, calculating devotion they hope to advance in power.

### Chaos Dwarf Tactics
In combat, chaos dwarves are stubborn, brutal, and capable of executing complex tactics utilizing a mix of different units. The chaos dwarf forces can include many types of soldiers, machines, and creatures, but there are tactical trends that can be found through most of their kind:

***Low Mobility.*** Like most dwarven forces, chaos dwarves fight best when they can force their enemies to come to them. They often make use of monsters and more mobile soldiers of other races to compensate for their lack of speed. Still, even these forces perform best when attacking foes already tangled up in combat with the elite chaos dwarf soldiers.
Heavy Firepower. Like many of their dwarven kin, chaos dwarves are master crafters and engineers. They create advanced firearms and artillery weapons imbued with fiendish power, which they bring to bare on their foes whenever possible.

***Mixed Forces.*** Between their heavy infantry, masses of expendable laborers, mobile creatures, menacing monsters, diabolic magic, and technically advanced firearms and war machines, chaos dwarves have a multitude of options at their disposal. And they excel at combining these forces in ways that offset their weaknesses.

***Enslavers.*** Chaos dwarf society runs on the back of forced labor, and they are always in need of more workers. Chaos dwarves avoid killing enemies in combat when it can feasibly be avoided. Defeated foes are transported back to the nearest chaos dwarf settlement, where they are quickly put to work.

***Heartless Discipline.*** Chaos dwarves possess the same level of resolve as their uncorrupted kin and will carry out battle plans to a tee, even putting themselves in danger to do so. To do anything less is considered a sign of weakness, and there is nothing chaos dwarves despise more than weakness.

\columnbreak

#### Engagement
Dwarves prefer to force their enemies to engage them. They will attempt to bombard foes with superior firepower to force an approach. Ideally, this allows the heavy dwarven infantry to engage their foes without needing to move to make the engagement themselves. This means of combat initiation is rarely subtle, and chaos dwarves typically do not attempt to sneak up on their enemies unless they’re utilizing stealthier minions of other races.

#### Combat
In battle, chaos dwarves seek to outlast their foes with durable creatures or masses of laborers while brutally breaking them into submission through superior firepower. They seek to establish a superior position in battle from which they can withstand any attacks while laying waste to their foes. What position they take and how they bring down their foes will depend on the creatures and weapons the chaos dwarves have at their disposal. They rarely fight with only one type of creature and usually rely on mixing strategies to offset exploitable weaknesses.

#### Retreat
Chaos dwarves are stubborn, but they aren’t stupid. If they see that their strategy has been countered, they may retreat to regroup and gather what they need to overcome their foes. If chaos dwarves suffer heavy losses, they will retreat to a more defensible position while calling for backup. 
If their enemies are retreating, the chaos dwarves will pursue them whenever possible, as defeated and fleeing foes present a prime opportunity for rounding up new laborers.

\pagebreakNum

## New Weapons
Chaos dwarves are known for their wicked ingenuity and have invented destructive firearms beyond the capabilities of most other races. The following firearm weapons are used by some of the chaos dwarf infantry described later and can be made available to players at the DM’s discretion. 

***Blunderbuss.*** Crafted in the dark forges of the chaos dwarves, blunderbusses are marvels of dark engineering, combining the dwarven knack for craftsmanship with cruel, destructive intent. Larger and more potent than the firearms wielded by their kin, these weapons are loaded with a lethal mix of shot, black powder, and arcane substances. When fired, they unleash devastating projectiles capable of decimating enemy ranks and piercing the strongest armor.

***Fire Glaive.*** These infernal weapons combine the melee capabilities of a traditional glaive with a rifle capable of shooting flaming projectiles. Fire glaives are rare and expensive to produce and, as such, are only used by the most elite chaos dwarf soldiers. Soldiers utilizing these weapons are able to act as hybrid warriors, alternating between melee and ranged combat depending on the needs of the battle.

#### Blunderbuss
*ranged weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 3d10
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Ammunition (range 80/320), reload (1), heavy, two-handed
- **Cost:** 75 gp

___

### New Weapon Properties 
&emsp;**Fire Glaive.** This weapon can be used to make ranged attacks that use its ammunition property. Attacks made this way deal an additional 1d10 fire damage on hit.

**Reload (X).**  This weapon can be fired X times before it must be reloaded using an action or in place of an attack that's part of an attack action or in place of an off-hand attack while duel wielding. The weapon can be reloaded early without losing any ammunition.

## Chaos Dwarf Soldiers

These soldiers are hardened, relentless warriors who form the backbone of the chaos dwarf armies, carrying out the will of their dark masters with brutal efficiency. They are twisted fighters shaped by the same dark energies that have corrupted the rest of their kin, making them formidable and ruthless combatants. Clad in sinister armor and wielding weapons crafted from the darkest depths of their infernal forges, chaos dwarf soldiers are a diabolic force capable of dominating nearly any foe they face.

On the battlefield, chaos dwarves share the stubborn determination of their uncorrupted kin and can adopt resolute stances, allowing them to focus their entire being on withstanding the onslaught of their enemies. This unwavering resolve grants them an uncanny ability to shrug off most attacks and maintain their position, even under the fiercest assaults. However, this defensive posture comes at a cost, as it slows their movement and makes them vulnerable to attacks that require nimbleness to avoid.

The chaos dwarf military forces are also known for their debilitating strikes that leave their enemies reeling from the sheer force of their blows. Even if their foes manage to regain their footing, the lingering effects of the strike leave them stunned and vulnerable. This combat technique is vital to the chaos dwarves as it allows them to defeat their foes while leaving them alive for capture and enslavement.

Overall, these soldiers possess an array of combat skills and abilities that complement each other in combat. Some soldiers specialize in melee combat, wielding wicked axes, maces, or hammers with ruthless precision. Others excel at ranged combat, employing devastating firearms that can lay waste to their enemies from afar. Together they can form nearly unassailable military forces capable of laying waste to any who stand in the way of their implacable march towards conquest. 

> ##### Dwarves with Polarms
> Though dwarves in many fantasy settings traditionally use axes in combat, halberds, and other polearms weapons better complement the tactics dwarves use. Otherwise, they are vulnerable to foes who use reach weapons against them. If you wish to give the dwarves more well-rounded tactical options, you can replace their battle axes with halberds and replace their ***Shield Fighter*** trait with the following trait (only do this for dwarves with shields):<Br>
***Halberd Master.***  The dwarf can wield a halberd in one hand and a shield in the other.

### Chaos Dwarf Warriors

These soldiers are the mainstay of their armies, displaying unwavering loyalty and fierce determination in battle. They are often found on the front lines of chaos dwarf forces, ready to face any foe with their cruel battleaxes and sturdy shields. The ring mail they don provides ample protection, while their shields are adorned with dread symbols of their dark allegiance. Like the warriors of their uncorrupted kin, they combine these masterfully crafted armaments with unyielding discipline to become a fighting force to be reckoned with.

Despite being among the lowest-ranking dwarven soldiers in their armies, compared to the warriors of other races, these chaos dwarves are still elite infantry. However, their combat prowess is offset by the relatively small population of their race. As such, chaos dwarf warriors cannot be fielded in the same numbers as warriors of other races and must often rely on a mass fodder force of indentured soldiers to fill out their numbers. Because of this constant need for more cannon fodder, chaos dwarf warriors often engage in raids to capture and conscript new soldiers for their army.

***Blazing Beard Warriors.*** These fiery warriors are a rare and fearsome sect of battle-hardened fighters who have delved deep into the secrets of flame, harnessing its destructive power to rain havoc upon their enemies. They are easily recognized by their brass armaments and flaming hair and beards. The blazing beards are specialized warriors often found in the ranks of the more ruthless and aggressive dwarf factions, using their mastery of flame to demoralize and devastate their foes.

Their prowess in battle is exemplified by their flaming battleaxes, which emit a searing heat that intensifies when either their target or the warrior is engulfed in flames. This fearsome power can turn the tide of battle as their foes are consumed by the relentless inferno.

When blazing beard warriors are able to focus their fury in combat, it manifests as a surge of intense heat that erupts from their very being, igniting any who dare approach. The resulting firestorm serves as a potent deterrent to those who would dare to approach these formidable warriors.

Staying out of range of their attacks proves futile, for most of these dwarves are armed with sinister incendiary devices, which they hurl into crowds of enemies unleashing a devastating inferno that can turn the tide of battle in an instant.

The bomb detonates at this point, and each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and ignites in flames (as described in Burning Resolve). On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't ignite. <br>

### Chaos Dwarf Blunderbussier
Chaos dwarf blunderbussiers are a terrifying <br> sight to behold on the battlefield. Known for their <br> distinctive, oversized firearms, these formidable <br> warriors unleash devastating volleys of fire and <br> shrapnel upon their enemies, their blunderbusses <br> roaring with the force of a miniature artillery <br> barrage.

Crafted in the dark forges of the chaos <br> dwarves, these blunderbusses are marvels of <br> dark engineering, combining the dwarven <br> knack for craftsmanship with a cruel, destructive <br> intent.

When fired, they unleash a <br> devastating cone of destruction, capable of <br> decimating enemy ranks and piercing the <br> strongest armor.

In battle, the blunderbussiers typically form <br> the backbone of the chaos Dwarf infantry, <br> positioned behind the ranks of shield-bearing <br> warriors. They unleash coordinated volleys at <br> the command of their overseers, turning tightly <br> packed enemy formations into charnel houses. <br> The sight and sound of their simultaneous discharge, a veritable wall of flame and death, is often enough to break the morale of all but the most steadfast enemies.

But the blunderbussiers are not just marksmen; like all chaos dwarves, they are more than capable of holding their own in close-quarters combat. When their blunderbusses are no longer of use, these dwarves can quickly don shields and draw axes to engage foes, and the blunderbussiers are as fearsome and relentless as any of their kin when forced to fight hand-to-hand.

#### The Granite Gaurd
The Granite Guard represents the pinnacle of chaos <br> dwarf marksmanship. An elite cadre of blunderbussiers, <br> they are renowned for their unerring accuracy and <br> ruthless precision. Each member of the Granite Guard <br> has honed their skills over decades, if not centuries, of unrelenting warfare, becoming master snipers capable <br> of picking off key targets even amidst the chaotic <br> tumult of battle.

In battle, the Granite Guard are masters of <br> suppressing enemy movement with their precision <br> shots. They focus their fire on key enemy units or <br> individuals, disrupting their movements and forcing <br> them to take cover. The sight of a Granite Guard lining <br> up a shot is enough to make any warrior think twice <br> before advancing, such is their fearsome reputation.

The Granite Guard often serves as the personal bodyguards to chaos dwarf overseers, providing them <br> with a formidable defensive line. Their ability to slow <br> and disrupt enemy forces proves invaluable in protecting their charges, making them a vital component of any <br> chaos dwarf force.
To become a member of the Granite Guard is a great honor, and only the most skilled and dedicated Blunderbussiers are considered for this prestigious role. These individuals undergo a grueling selection process, during which they must prove their mettle in a series of trials that test their skill, patience, and resolve.

### Infernal Guard

The warriors represent an elite cadre of chaos dwarf soldiers that serve as the vanguard of their dark masters. These fearsome warriors are bound together by a shared history of past failures, which they seek to atone for through unwavering loyalty, unmatched ferocity, and the merciless conquest of their enemies. The path of the infernal guard is one of redemption and suffering, as each member dons an iron mask that obscures their visage, a symbol of their shame and a constant reminder of the debts they must repay.

The iron masks serve not only as a sign of their penance but also as a tool of dehumanization, stripping the infernal guard of their individuality and forging them into a single, cohesive unit. Beneath these forbidding masks, the infernal guard finds solace in their shared purpose and the brutal path toward atonement they have been provided. In battle, these masks instill fear in the hearts of their enemies, as they come to understand that they face an adversary that is relentless, unforgiving, and without mercy.

In their quest for redemption, the infernal <br> guard is often tasked with carrying out the most <br> dangerous and brutal missions for their dark masters. From leading daring assaults on heavily fortified strongholds to hunting down powerful adversaries deep within enemy territory, the infernal guard willingly accepts any challenge, no matter the odds or the cost. For these warriors, each successful mission brings them one step closer to absolution and the eventual removal of their iron masks, a moment of triumph that few among their ranks will ever know.

Encountering the infernal guard on the battlefield is a harrowing experience, as their foes must face not only the formidable prowess of these elite warriors but also the relentless determination that drives them. The infernal guard will stop at nothing to achieve their objectives and atone for their past failures, and those who stand in their way must be prepared to face the full fury of their wrath.

***Fireglaivadiers.*** Among the ranks of the infernal guard, those who are chosen to bear the fire glaives are regarded with a mixture of awe and dread. These fireglaivadiers, as they are known, represent the perfect union of martial prowess and inventive savagery that is the hallmark of the chaos dwarves.

Donning their iron masks of atonement, each fireglaivadiers is handpicked for their skill, strength, and utter ruthlessness in battle. They are trained to master the Fire Glaive, a weapon as dangerous to its wielder as it is to the enemy if not handled with the utmost care. 


\columnbreak

Yet, these warriors wield their deadly tools with a seemingly effortless grace, shifting between devastating melee attacks and lethal ranged assaults as the tide of battle demands.

In battle, the Fire Glaive Infernals form the vanguard of the chaos dwarf armies, their flaming weapons carving swathes through the enemy ranks. Their presence on the battlefield is a sign of the chaos dwarves' determination to achieve victory at any cost. For the fireglaivadiers do not merely fight – they annihilate, leaving nothing but scorched earth and burning wreckage in their wake.

### Infernal Ironsworn
The infernal ironsworn are the most elite members of the infernal guard, chosen for their unwavering loyalty, exceptional combat prowess, and unyielding devotion to the cause of their dark masters. Handpicked from the ranks of the infernal guard, these warriors are entrusted with the sacred duty of serving as personal soldiers and bodyguards for the highest-ranking chaos dwarves, including sorcerer-priests, warlords, and other leaders of their dark society.

Throwable blasting charges are a signature weapon of the infernal ironsworn, a testament to the deadly ingenuity of the chaos dwarves. Forged in the dark, magma-filled foundries deep within their subterranean strongholds, these compact and potent explosives combine alchemical prowess with the lethal cunning of their creators. The charges contain a highly volatile concoction of volatile minerals and arcane substances, carefully encased within a rugged iron shell. When hurled at enemies, the blasting charges detonate with devastating force, unleashing a searing wave of flame and shrapnel that can tear through flesh and armor alike.

In their role as protectors of the highest-ranking chaos dwarves, the infernal ironsworn are expected to be ever-vigilant, anticipating and neutralizing any threat to their charges before it can manifest. Their keen senses, honed by years of brutal training and the harsh lessons of their past failures, enable them to detect the subtlest signs of danger, allowing them to react with lightning speed to counter any would-be assassins or saboteurs.

On a success, a creature takes half as much damage. <br>
> When the dwarf attempts to throw the bomb, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the dwarf this way, the dwarf drops the bomb, and it detonates at the dwarf's location.

### Overseers

Chaos dwarf overseers are a distinct and influential caste within their dark society, serving as both slave masters and military generals. These cunning and ruthless individuals wield tremendous power and authority, overseeing the vast legions of slaves and lesser chaos dwarves that toil in the name of their malevolent masters.

As slave masters, chaos dwarf overseers are responsible for maintaining order and productivity within the sprawling slave workforce that fuels their dark empire. They are masters of manipulation and control, employing a combination of fear, brutality, and martial prowess to keep their thralls in line. In addition to the physical and psychological torment they inflict upon their captives, overseers use their unyielding authority and presence to ensure the unwavering obedience and submission of their slaves.

In their capacity as military generals, chaos dwarf overseers are tasked with leading the armies of their dark masters into battle. They are shrewd tacticians and skilled commanders, well-versed in the arts of war and the unique capabilities of their diverse troops. From the disciplined ranks of the infernal guard to the rampaging hordes of enslaved creatures, the overseers expertly marshal these forces to achieve their masters' objectives with brutal efficiency.

The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) fire damage. A creature hit by the attack has disadvantage on the saving throw.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The dwarf makes two attacks.
>
> ***Fire Glaive.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10  + 3) piercing damage. If it was a ranged attack, it deals an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage. If the dwarf made a ranged attack, it can’t do so again with this weapon until it loads it as an action or in place of an attack that’s part of an attack action. It can also load it when it uses its Resolute Stance feature (no action required).
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Infusion of Hatred (3/day).*** The dwarf chooses one other creature it can see within 30 feet of it and infuses it with hatred for the next minute. While infused this way, the first time the creature hits with an attack each turn, it deals additional 5 (1d10) fire damage.

### Chaos Dwarf Soldier Loot
Because chaos dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Chaos Dwarf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Chaos Dwarf Infantry Tactics
Chaos dwarfs are twisted versions of regular dwarves who possess perverted versions of traditional dwarven traits. Dwarven stubbornness has turned to unrelenting hatred, their love of crafting has been channeled into the creation of weapons of destruction, and their pride now causes them to see all others as beneath them. 

Despite these grotesque changes in attitude, the combat tactics of chaos dwarfs differ little from those of their standard kin. They are most effective when occupying a fortified position and using ranged weaponry to batter their enemies from afar while their unyielding melee forces hold the line.

One significant difference in combat strategy stems from their reliance on acquiring forced labor, as chaos dwarf society runs on the backs of captured prisoners who are relentlessly worked to death. This means chaos dwarves will not be content to drive an enemy off. If an enemy force flees, and the chaos dwarves believe they have an overwhelming combat advantage, they will chase down their foes to capture them. 

There are two abilities common to all chaos dwarves:

#### Resolute Stance

Dwarves can best use this ability when fighting in confined spaces that don’t require much movement. The optimal scenario involves a mix of ranged and melee dwarf combatants. The ranged dwarves will hunker down behind cover with this ability, making it very difficult to counter them with ranged attacks. They will then have melee dwarfs stand about 5 or 10 feet in front of them to stop anyone who approaches with readied attacks. Dwarves are patient and resilient, so they will tolerate taking fire from enemies this way if it seems like their own ranged attacks are outpacing their enemies’.

If the players bombard chaos dwarves with area-of-effect attacks or effects that force saving throws, this may force dwarves out of their defensive position and cause them to charge the players or even flee if they’ve taken heavy damage. Though, many chaos dwarves can resist common damage types such as poison and fire, which may allow them to better endure such abilities.

When dwarves use this ability, be sure to communicate it to the players. You can say something to the effect of “the dwarf plants his feet firmly and stares you down, ready for anything that comes at him.”

#### Debilitating Strike

The primary purpose of this ability is to allow chaos dwarves to take prisoners of war to serve as forced labor. They will do non-lethal damage when bringing creatures down to 0 hit points, even if they’re fighting a group with a healer. 

#### Chaos Dwarf Warriors

Chaos Dwarf warriors act as the frontline in battle. When part of a well-balanced army, they generally use the standard chaos dwarf tactics described earlier. However, if they are the only type of soldier on the battlefield, they will take one of two tactics depending on the situation.
* If the enemy can attack from range, the dwarfs charge into melee combat, taking the Dash action if needed to get within range. On their next turn, they will take a Resolute stance and fight, forcing their opponent to either fight them in melee with disadvantage or take an opportunity attack to withdraw.
* If the enemy charges the chaos dwarf warriors, they will merely hold their position with Resolute Stance and ready attacks for when the enemy comes within reach.

Chaos dwarf warriors prioritize attacking targets they can reach while in a Resolute Stance.

##### Blazing Beard Warriors

When blazing beards are on fire, their attacks deal more damage. Moreover, when they attack an enemy that is already on fire, it causes even more damage. Their main priority is to set as many enemies and other blazing beards on fire. There are several ways to achieve this, including:
* If a blazing beard is moving towards an enemy and can't quite reach them, they can throw a naphtha bomb that hits the enemy and themselves on the opposite edge of the blast radius.
* If a blazing beard is in a resolute stance and doesn't want to move, it may use its naphtha bomb as described above.
* Running into a group of creatures using their burning resolve ability is also quite effective.

####  Blunderbussiers
Blunderbussier tactics are simpler than those of melee chaos dwarf infantry, as they only need to find a good vantage point from which to enter a Resolute Srance and start blasting their foes. There are a few factors to keep in mind:
* The blunderbuss is a two-handed weapon, so the dwarf cannot hold a shield while using it.
* The Piercing Rounds ability means that the dwarf will prioritize targets with high AC but low health.
* After each attack with a blunderbuss, the dwarf must either use up its next action to reload it or enter a Resolute Stance at the start of its next turn, which will prevent it from moving. 
* If the dwarf cannot reload its blunderbuss effectively and is caught in melee combat, it will not hesitate to switch to a shield and axe to fight.

##### The Granite Guard
These soldiers are even more effective snipers than normal blunderbussiers, though they have no qualms about engaging isolated creatures in melee combat if need be.

One difference in their tactics stems from their Suppressing Fire ability, which makes them more likely to shoot targets that rely on speed, such as rogues.

#### Infernal Guards
These are elite dwarven soldiers that fight with unflinching resolve. Their tactics will depend on what they’re armed with.

##### Axemen
These infernal guards are just a stronger version of chaos dwarf warriors, with the only mechanical difference being that their attacks made with advantage hit even harder. Their tactics are essentially the same as normal chaos dwarf warriors. 

##### Fireglaivadiers
Fireglaivadiers are unique in that they have a ranged attack but are more effective in melee combat. There are several attack sequences they can use:

When in a Resolute Stance with an enemy in melee range, they can make both a ranged attack and a melee attack. Since they don't suffer disadvantage from using ranged attacks in melee combat, this is the most effective attack pattern.

When in a Resolute Stance with no enemies nearby, they can only make a single ranged attack. This is useful when defending a position and waiting for enemies to come to them.

If the dwarf is close to a pursuing enemy or slowly retreating, they can make two melee attacks.

When trying to finish off fleeing targets, they can fire their weapon and use their other attack to reload. This is not an optimal attack pattern and should be avoided as possible.


#### Infernal Ironsworn
The main difference between infernal ironsworn and other chaos dwarf infantry is their blasting charges. They will usually use their blasting charges when they are being charged, when charging toward an enemy, or if they can hit three or more targets. However, there are two things they must watch out for:

* Enemies within their reach can interrupt the grenade and cause it to detonate on top of the dwarf.
* When throwing the grenade, the dwarf must consider that other dwarves may be hit by the blast. Some dwarves are resistant to fire or outright immune in the case of the infernal ironguard. However, if dwarves caught in the blast are in a resolute stance, they will have disadvantage on the saving throw and likely take the full piercing damage from the blast. Depending on the circumstances, the infernal ironsworn may still opt to use the bombs even if they hit allies.

##### The Immortals
The signature ability of The Immortals is their Undying Will. It's important to note that they start the fight with extra temporary hit points granted by this ability. The Immortals typically begin the fight clustered together and try to bait out area-of-effect spells from the enemy, hoping that it won't deal enough damage to break their Undying Will, and they'll simply regain their lost temporary hit points. They may avoid this tactic if they know the enemy has area-of-effect spells that deal damage other than fire. Once The Immortals have spread out, they use their Undying Will to keep themselves safe while moving into prime positions. They prefer to fight one-on-one, as facing multiple enemies poses a greater risk of damage overcoming their Undying Will.

\columnbreak



#### Chaos Dwarf Overseers
Chaos dwarf overseers can make their allies more aggressive. They are most effective when the overseer has a mix of cheap expendable units, such as forced laborers and more elite dwarves and warriors.

##### Brutal Motivation
The overseer can use one of his attacks to kill one of his laborers to activate this ability. As long as at least two of his dwarves benefit from it, he will consider it a worthwhile tradeoff. The overseer can also trigger the ability by reducing an enemy to zero hit points, but this is a risky move and should only be done if he’s sure to bring the enemy down.

##### Harsh Discipline
The overseer sends non-dwarf laborers to slow down the enemy before using this ability on his dwarves and any laborers within range. This allows the laborers to better hold their ground and the dwarves to march forward and fight more effectively.

#### Chaos Dwarf Castellans
Chaos dwarf castellans share most of the techniques used by fireglaivadiers, with a couple of new abilities added to their arsenal:

##### Infusion of Hatred
This enhancement is placed on the most deadly dwarf under the castellan’s command who is not already benefiting from it, and it will use this bonus action every turn during combat. 

##### Specialized Ammunition
The castellan has two specialized bullets that it can fire from its fire glaive and will use them in different ways depending on the spacing of its opponents.

If its enemies are grouped up, it will use Infernal Slugs if it can affect three or more targets with the slug’s blast. Otherwise, it will use Molten Bullets on creatures that are either the most isolated from their allies or concentrating on spells. This can set up a deadly combo as party members attempt to assist each other with pulling out the Molten Bullets, while the castellan can take full advantage of them being near each other to pelt them with Infernal Slugs.


#### Dwarves With Polearms
The variant rule that allows dwarves to use halberds does not change their tactics but improves the already listed tactics, as having reach enables them to use their Resolute Stance more frequently. If you’re using this rule, keep in mind that it does remove the dwarves’ weakness to reach weapons. This is a more realistic tactical choice on their part, but it also gives players few options to counter them.
