# Chaos Dwarves Compendium

Chaos dwarves are a malevolent and tyrannical race of dwarves whose souls have been twisted by dark forces, transforming them into ruthless beings driven by greed and a desire for dominion. Unlike their noble kin, they have wholly embraced the chaotic energies that permeate their existence, using these arcane powers to reshape their bodies and minds in pursuit of their sinister goals. The Chaos Dwarves' descent into darkness is marked not only by their wicked actions, but also by their grotesque appearance, with blackened, gnarled features and twisted, horn-like protrusions that serve as a constant reminder of their fall from grace.

In the varied worlds that they inhabit, chaos dwarves are often found dwelling in the deepest, most inhospitable regions, where they construct formidable citadels and forge sinister alliances with other denizens of darkness. Fueled by their insatiable ambition, they engage in relentless conquests, enslaving the weak and crushing those who dare to defy their will. Their society is structured around an ironclad hierarchy, with the most powerful sorcerer-priests at its apex, guiding their kin with an unyielding grip. Chaos Dwarves possess a unique blend of potent magic and technological prowess, making them a formidable force to be reckoned with on any battlefield.


## Running Chaos Dwarf Encounters
The setting you’re running your adventures in will help determine the background of this dwarven race and the specifics of their lore. In some settings, they may be twisted by the forces of chaos into malevolent beings. If your setting has a cosmology aligned with more classical D&D settings, these dwarves will likely align themselves with devils, given that they share a lawful evil and tyrannical nature.

### Roleplaying Chaos Dwarves

Chaos dwarves are ambitious power seekers, always looking to advance themselves above others. They view other races with contempt, seeing their kind as superior to all others. Chaos dwarves meeting the players will either see them as a means to an end or as obstacles to be destroyed. They may be willing to trade with the players, but if the players are aligned with forces opposed to the interest of the chaos dwarves or their masters, they will likely turn on the players before long.  

Consider these traits when playing on the decisions and behavior of chaos dwarves. They are not reckless barbarians, but calculating tyrants, always looking for that chance to further their machinations, enhance their wealth, or advance in power. That said, they still value loyalty to their masters, and though they scheme and plot their way up through their hierarchies, chaos dwarves will carry out their assigned duties without question. For it is through this loyalty and cold, calculating devotion they hope to advance in power.

### Chaos Dwarf Tactics
In combat, chaos dwarves are stubborn, brutal, and capable of executing complex tactics utilizing a mix of different units. The chaos dwarf forces can include many types of soldiers, machines, and creatures, but there are tactical trends that can be found through most of their kind:

***Low Mobility.*** Like most dwarven forces, chaos dwarves fight best when they can force their enemies to come to them. They often make use of monsters and more mobile soldiers of other races to compensate for their lack of speed. Still, even these forces perform best when attacking foes already tangled up in combat with the elite chaos dwarf soldiers.
Heavy Firepower. Like many of their dwarven kin, chaos dwarves are master crafters and engineers. They create advanced firearms and artillery weapons imbued with fiendish power, which they bring to bare on their foes whenever possible.

***Mixed Forces.*** Between their heavy infantry, masses of expendable laborers, mobile creatures, menacing monsters, diabolic magic, and technically advanced firearms and war machines, chaos dwarves have a multitude of options at their disposal. And they excel at combining these forces in ways that offset their weaknesses.

***Enslavers.*** Chaos dwarf society runs on the back of forced labor, and they are always in need of more workers. Chaos dwarves avoid killing enemies in combat when it can feasibly be avoided. Defeated foes are transported back to the nearest chaos dwarf settlement, where they are quickly put to work.

***Heartless Discipline.*** Chaos dwarves possess the same level of resolve as their uncorrupted kin and will carry out battle plans to a tee, even putting themselves in danger to do so. To do anything less is considered a sign of weakness, and there is nothing chaos dwarves despise more than weakness.

#### Engagement
Dwarves prefer to force their enemies to engage them. They will attempt to bombard foes with superior firepower to force an approach. Ideally, this allows the heavy dwarven infantry to engage their foes without needing to move to make the engagement themselves. This means of combat initiation is rarely subtle, and chaos dwarves typically do not attempt to sneak up on their enemies unless they’re utilizing stealthier minions of other races.

#### Combat
In battle, chaos dwarves seek to outlast their foes with durable creatures or masses of laborers while brutally breaking them into submission through superior firepower. They seek to establish a superior position in battle from which they can withstand any attacks while laying waste to their foes. What position they take and how they bring down their foes will depend on the creatures and weapons the chaos dwarves have at their disposal. They rarely fight with only one type of creature and usually rely on mixing strategies to offset exploitable weaknesses.

#### Retreat
Chaos dwarves are stubborn, but they aren’t stupid. If they see that their strategy has been countered, they may retreat to regroup and gather what they need to overcome their foes. If chaos dwarves suffer heavy losses, they will retreat to a more defensible position while calling for backup. 
If their enemies are retreating, the chaos dwarves will pursue them whenever possible, as defeated and fleeing foes present a prime opportunity for rounding up new laborers.
