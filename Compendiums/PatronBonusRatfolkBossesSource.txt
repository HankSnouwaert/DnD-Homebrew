# Patron Bonus Ratfolk Bosses





## Lord Skrikch Ratking
*Demonic Embodiment of The Sinister Rat Council*<br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual, Religious  <br>
In the deeps of the world, where light dares not linger, there festered the ratfolk, a verminous brood whose hearts were as black as the caverns they skulked. Within moldering tombs and upon tablets of worn stone, their sinister chronicles were graven—tales of treachery and guile wrought in ages forgotten. Yet one tale, darkest of all, looms above the rest, its words steeped in such evil.

In that ancient time, the Rat God, a deity of greatest malice, summoned the most cunning and ruthless of his kind to a grand council. The lands above lay in disarray, their nations frail and faltering, ripe for conquest. The Rat God, in his verminous ambition, sought to bind his vassals under one purpose: to overrun the surface and claim dominion over all. 

Yet, as the ratfolk’s agents sowed sabotage and discord above, breaking the strength of men and their kingdoms, the council’s unity unraveled. Each member, black-hearted and covetous, nursed dreams of sole supremacy. Treachery spread like plague. Armies turned upon armies; assassins crept in every shadow. Tunnels and caverns, the very veins of their underworld, collapsed in the chaos. The opportunity to seize the world above slipped through their claws, and the ratfolk’s empire crumbled into shambles.

So great was the wrath of the Rat God that the veil of reality itself tore asunder. For a fleeting moment, the barrier between his hellish realm and the mortal world parted. Clawed hands reached forth from the abyss, seizing the bickering councilmembers who yet survived. Dragged shrieking into the shadows, they were cast into the forsaken depths of their god’s domain, a place where Time itself turned its back. There, amidst the ghosts of their murdered kin—slain in their own climb to power—they cowered.

The Rat God, in his spite, departed, leaving his treacherous congregants to waste through an eternity uncounted. Lamentations rose, accusations echoed, a ceaseless cacophony in the void. The abandoned souls, famished, fed upon the misery and hatred that permeated their prison, for death granted no release. Yet, in time, the Rat God, moved by the dark virtues of his flock—the very traits of cunning and malice for which he favored them—did show mercy. He loosed them from their prison, only to behold a twitching mass of flesh and souls, fused as one, crawling forth from the pit of despair.

The Rat God gazed upon this unintended creation and resolved to shape it into his greatest servant. By his dread power, the mass was forged into a demon, Skrikch Ratking, within whose form writhed the myriad knaveries of the fallen council.

\columnbreak



Bound within its chest were four orbs, each a testament to the ratfolk’s essence: one encrusted with green pestilence, symbol of their plague; one slick with crimson blood, icon of their ruthless guile; one swirling with violet smoke, emblem of their shadowed machinations; and one crackling with green lightning, a mark of their ruinous sorcery and lust for dominion.

This epitome of vermin, driven by the unfulfilled ambitions of its makers, seeks ever to shatter the walls betwixt worlds. At the edges of existence, where reality grows thin, Skrikch Ratking prowls, yearning to fulfill the will of the Rat God and bring doom upon the realms above.

### Ratking's Lair
When Lord Skrikch Ratking enters the mortal realm, his foul presence perverts the world, causing darkness and disease to flourish. These gateways are opened by ratfolk, whose detestable traits are amplified in the presence of the vile demon.

#### Regional Effects  

The presence of Ratking has a drastic impact on his surroundings, spreading corruption within a 10-mile radius of his lair that causes the following effects:

* **Tainted Provisions.** Any food or potions left in the area for more than 24 hours become tainted until removed from the region for the same duration. Any creature that is not a rat, ratfolk, or demon that eats or drinks the tainted substance takes 16 (3d10) Necrotic damage.

* **Veil of Ratking.** While in darkness, any rat, ratfolk, or demon is invisible to creatures that are not rats, ratfolk, or demons if those creatures rely on Darkvision to see in that darkness.

* **Restless Corruption.** Creatures that are not rats, ratfolk, or demons cannot gain the benefits of a Long Rest.

* **Twisted Truth.** Rats, ratfolk, and demons within the region can present false thoughts and cannot be magically compelled to tell the truth. They may make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader’s Wisdom (Insight) check to present false thoughts. Additionally, spells or effects that detect lies or compel truth indicate the creature is being truthful, if it so chooses. This applies even if the creature is knowingly lying.



### Epic Battle: Hearts of Ruination 
For a mythic encounter with Ratking, increase the hit points of each of his orbs to 200 hit points. Additionally, when the 3rd orb has been destroyed, have the last remaining orb gain 100 extra hitpoints that last until Ratking restores all of his orbs. This increases Ratking to a CR 27 encounter

### Will of the Rat God

You may grant Ratking the following ability. If you do, his CR increases by 2.

> ### Will of the Rat God
>  When Ratking rolls initiative, he calls upon the power of the Rat God. The Rat God's presence, which possesses an Intelligence of 24, acts autonomously and always in Ratking's best interest. For the next minute, or until Ratking dies, the Rat God's presence remains active. While active, it is aware of the location of any creature within 120 feet of Ratking.  
> On initiative count 30 (losing initiative ties), the Rat God triggers one of the following effects based on which orb has the least hit points. If two or more orbs are tied, the Rat God chooses which effect to use.
> 
> **Deceiver Orb: Mind Shroud** Two creatures within 150 feet of Ratking must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 21). <br>
> *Failure:* The creature takes 13 (3d8) Psychic damage and is Mystified. While Mystified, the creature uses half its movement at the start of its turn to travel in a random direction (roll a d8 to determine direction) before taking the rest of its turn as normal. If only one orb is active, Ratking is also invisible to the creature until initiative count 30 of the next round. <br>
> *Success:* The creature takes half damage only. <br>
>
> **Warbringer Orb: Slashing Cyclone.** The Rat God chooses a point within 100 feet of Ratking. Each creature other than Ratking within 30 feet of that point must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 21. <br>
*Failure:* The creature takes 13 (3d8) Slashing damage and is pulled 20 feet toward the point. If only one orb is active, the creature also can’t regain hit points until initiative count 30 of the next round. <br>
*Success:* The creature takes half damage only. <br>
>
> **Corruptor Orb: Cloud of Filth.** A cloud of filth fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 150 feet of Ratking. The cloud lasts until initiative count 30 of the next round. If only one orb is active, the effect lasts 1 minute instead. The area becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than Ratking. Each creature other than Ratking that ends its turn in the area must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 21. <br>
*Failure:* The creature takes 16 (3d10) Necrotic damage. <br>
*Success:* The creature takes half damage only. <br>
>
> **Hexseer Orb: Overwhelming Static.** Two creatures within 150 feet of Ratking must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* (DC 21)  (the save is made with disadvantage if the creature is flying). <br>
*Failure:* The creature takes 16 (3d10) Lightning damage. If only one orb is active, the creature also has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws until initiative count 30 of the next round. <br>
*Success:* The creature takes half damage only.

### Lord Skrikch Ratking Tactics 

Skrikch Ratking's tactics vary depending on which of his orbs are destroyed first, as this is often determined by his foes' choices rather than his own. Below is a breakdown of his abilities and tactical priorities for each orb and the Will of the Rat God.

#### Orb Abilities and Tactics
&emsp;***Deceiver Orb: Assassinate.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Target isolated enemies whenever possible. Skrikch should use his movement to position himself near a lone target. <br>
**Priorities:** If the Warbringer Orb's Bloody Arc ability is still active, prioritize targets with healing abilities or high medicine checks.
If the Hexseer Orb's Hex Lightning Storm is the only other active orb, focus on targets capable of removing Fatigue.

***Warbringer Orb: Bloody Arc.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Aim to hit as many targets as possible, particularly those with low Dexterity, to spread wounds across multiple enemies, making it harder for them to recover. <br>
**Priorities:** Maximize the number of affected targets to overwhelm foes with cumulative wounds.

***Corruptor Orb: Defiled Ground.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Target as many enemies as possible. If one or more other orbs have been destroyed, use this ability to daze creatures, preventing them from escaping Bloody Arc or Hex Lightning Storm. <br>
**Priorities:** Focus on crowd control to hinder enemy movement and coordination.

***Hexseer Orb: Hex-Lightning Storm.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Hit as many targets as possible. Once Hex Lightning Storm begins causing Fatigue, Skrikch will prioritize targets that already have Fatigue levels. <br>
**Priorities:** Amplify the effect of Fatigue by focusing on already-fatigued enemies to debilitate them further.

#### Will of the Rat God Abilities and Tactics
&emsp;***Deceiver Orb: Mind Shroud.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Use to keep targets separated from one another, disrupting their ability to coordinate. <br>
**Priorities:** If only one orb remains, target creatures that heavily rely on Advantage, such as rogues or other martial fighters, to neutralize their effectiveness. <br>

***Warbringer Orb: Slashing Cyclone.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Use to pull targets closer together, setting them up for Bloody Arc. <br>
**Priorities:** If only one orb remains, target enemies with a high number of wounds to prevent them from healing effectively.

***Corruptor Orb: Cloud of Filth.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Deploy to force opponents out of favorable positions, disrupting their tactical advantage. <br>
**Priorities:** Use strategically to control the battlefield and expose enemies to further attacks.<br>

***Hexseer Orb: Overwhelming Static.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Target two creatures with low Dexterity saving throws or those who have accumulated the most Fatigue.<br>
**Priorities:** Focus on enemies already weakened by Fatigue or those vulnerable to Dexterity-based effects to maximize impact.


\pagebreakNum

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Fatigue
> The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.
> 
> **Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.
> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue. 

\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
> 
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

## Vaskrik, The Exterminator
*Nigh-Unkillable Cybernetically Enhanced Ratfolk Assassin* <br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Individual, Armaments

This murderous oddity stalks the streets of the surface world, consumed by the singular drive of the hunt. Those unfortunate enough to glimpse this creature see a hunched ratfolk figure, its body a fusion of flesh and machinery. Brass prosthetics replace limbs and swaths of skin, while where hands used to be, now monstrous, bladed claws are in their stead. Embedded in its arms are twin firearms, loaded with bullets carved from deadly cursed stone. Most terrifying is the creature’s face: one beady eye is missing, replaced by a glowing red lens fixed within a brass framework. Like a hellish telescope, this strange device extends with a soft hum, locking onto whatever has caught its predatory interest.

This walking phantom was once Vaskrik, a ratfolk assassin of unparalleled skill. His abominable transformation came after a nearly impossible mission to rescue an Eldritch Engineer. Vaskrik succeeded, leaving a trail of blood in his wake, but victory came at a terrible cost. Maimed and clinging to life, he was saved by the very engineer he rescued. The artificer replaced Vaskrik’s failing body parts with sorcerous forged limbs of bone-crushing strength, devices implanted in his shattered skull amplified his already lethal instincts, forging him into something more construct than ratfolk, turning him into a relentless automaton. Now known as the Exterminator among his kind, Vaskrik is barely controlled by his clan. When assigned a target, nothing—neither pain nor fear—can deter him. He will not stop until his quarry is dead.

***Vaskrik’s Core.***
The mechanical workings of Vaskrik’s form are a mystery, even to the cunning engineer who created them. It is said that even if his mortal body is burned or flayed away, his robotic components will persist, lurching forward with an unyielding intent to annihilate.


### Epic Battle: Vaskrik's Core
If you wish to turn Vaskrik into a truly terrifying encounter, you can have his mechanical frame continue to fight even after his flesh is destroyed. 

When Vaskrik dies, even if his body would otherwise be destroyed, his flesh instead sloughs off, leaving behind Vaskrik’s Core in the space he occupied. Vaskrik’s Core retains the same initiative count as Vaskrik. When the core appears, each hostile creature within a 120-foot emanation must make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 18.

*Failure:* The creature is Frightened and can’t cast spells other than cantrips while Frightened this way. It may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

*Failure by 10+:* While Frightened, the creature can’t take reactions and must take the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the core by the safest available route.

Vaskrik and his core combined should be considered a CR 17 encounter.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a Move, an Action, or a Bonus Action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

### Vaskrik's Tactics
&emsp;**Lock-On:** Vaskrik targets an enemy designated for elimination or the one with the lowest Constitution and Strength. He switches targets if another foe significantly hinders access to his chosen target.

**Attacks:** Prefers close-range Rend attacks. Uses Hex Pistol for distant targets to inflict rending wounds and Daze conditions so that they can’t escape, and he can close the distance.

**Uncanny Dodge:** Reserves for evading high-damage attacks such as Sneak Attacks from rogues or smites from paladins. Avoids making opportunity attacks unless against his Locked-On target.

**Sweep Aside:** Pushes away enemies protecting his target or throws a creature at his Locked-On target to knock it Prone.

**Vaskrik’s Core:** Mirrors Vaskrik’s tactics but prioritizes pursuing, Grappling, and crushing the target.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Evasion.*** If Vaskrik is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, he takes no damage on a successful save and half damage on a failed save.
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** Vaskrik can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than himself without squeezing.
>
> ***Lock-On.*** At the start of his turn, Vaskrik can choose to Lock-On to a target with his glowing red eye. While Locked-On to a creature, he has advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks made to find that creature.
>
> ***Nimble Reflexes.*** When a creature 30 feet or more away from Vaskrik that he can see makes a ranged attack against him, the attack is made with disadvantage unless Vaskrik is Grappled, Incapacitated, or Restrained.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Rend.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) Slashing damage, or 26 (6d6 + 5) Slashing damage if Vaskrik is Locked-On to the target.
>
> ***Hexlock Pistol.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) Piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) Radiant damage, or 22 (5d6 + 5) Piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) Radiant damage if Vaskrik is Locked-On to the target.  
> Vaskrik has four pistols built into his body; he can’t use a pistol again until he uses an Action to reload it or replaces an attack in the Attack action to reload.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Pursue.*** Vaskrik moves up to his Speed toward a target he is Locked-On to. This movement does not provoke opportunity attacks.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Vaskrik gains three additional actions in combat: Maim, Sweep Aside, and Concussive Blow. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count (losing ties), separate from his own, if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace any action with Tenacious Will, and he can use Tenacious Will even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Maim (Initiative Count 15).*** Vaskrik moves up to 20 feet and then makes an attack against a creature he is Locked-On to. If the attack hits, the target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 18. <br>
> *Failure:* The target takes 10 (3d6) Piercing damage and suffers a rending Wound. While Wounded, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, checks, and attack rolls, and its Speed is halved.  
> The Wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a *Wisdom (Medicine) Check:* DC 18, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if the creature regains 15 or more hit points.
>
> ***Sweep Aside (Initiative Count 10).*** Vaskrik moves up to 20 feet. During this movement, each creature he moves within 5 feet of for the first time this turn must make a *Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw* (the creature’s choice): DC 18. <br>
> *Failure:* Vaskrik moves the target 15 feet away from him and knocks it Prone. If the target is moved into another creature, that creature must also make the saving throw or be knocked Prone.
>
> ***Concussive Blow (Initiative Count 5).*** Vaskrik moves up to 20 feet and then makes an attack against a creature he is Locked-On to. If the attack hits, the target must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 18. <br>
> *Failure:* The target is Dazed*, can’t Concentrate, and can’t stand up from being Prone. It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Vaskrik is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Uncanny Dodge.*** When an attacker that Vaskrik can see hits him with an attack, he halves the damage taken.

## Vizzik Skour, Prophet of the Rat
*Verminous Demon Herald of Apocalyptic Madness*<br>
**Habitat:** Extraplanar; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual, Religious  <br>

They say within the shadows that loom in the deepest parts of the world, there are doorways to worlds beyond. From these ebon gateways a beast shall stride forth in dark pilgrimage, upon cloven hooves, with a pink worm-tail trailing behind it—prophet of the rat god, a creature wrought from his vile thought and will. A staff of gnawed wood shall be clutched in pale claws, and four horns shall twist in spirals from its verminous head; both are mantles of its dark authority, bestowed upon it by the god of ruin.

It shall move through the caverns of the earth, its eyes aglow with the vile dreams of its master, its voice a screeching concerto filled with hatred for the peoples of the surface world and their gods. The ratfolk that dwell below shall hear the echoes of such sermons, and behold the dancing images within its burning eyes, and be driven mad; their teeth shall gnash as they chitter prayers of war and decay, and they shall scurry forward in crazed fervour, ushered by that frenzy.

Then the beast of the rat god shall claw its way skyward, until its flaming eyes are set upon the heavens and the green rolling hills; there its song shall grow ever louder, its eyes filled with even greater nightmares. Those that catch its monstrous sight, or are subjected to its hymns, shall be consumed by insanity. And the air itself shall split from the strain of the unholy clamour that rampages about it; such wounds shall have teeth, and open unto a kingdom of terror, whence the devotees of the rat god shall spill forth from the maw, and it shall devour all else.

And the beast shall look upon all that which it has poisoned with its sermons, to the vile joy of the rat god; and the vermin’s children shall feast on one another in the ruined world that was, for there shall be none left for the creatures to hate but one another.

These ratfolk remain until destroyed or until the portal disappears. They act on their own turns, immediately after this action’s initiative count. The portal can have up to four Warriors of Ruin at a time from this feature.

>  * The creature can only gain levels of Fury during combat, and all levels are lost when combat ends.
>  * A creature can gain up to a max of 6 levels of Fury.
>  * First time each turn the creature hits a target with an attack, it deals an additional 1d4 damage for each level of Fury it has.

> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
