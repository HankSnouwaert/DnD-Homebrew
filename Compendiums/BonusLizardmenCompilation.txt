# Bonus Lizardmen Compilation

## World Shaper Engines
*Arcane Terraforming Monuments*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Arcane <br>

There are places in the world that have remained unchanged since before the first primates or villages of mankind sprang into existence. Verdant jungles, teeming with archaic, scale-covered behemoths, trample through dense undergrowth filled with flora and fauna found nowhere else. These cradles of life are heedless of slowly changing weather over millennia or the gradual drifting of continents, remaining warm and wet even as surrounding lands plunged into ice ages or shriveled into barren deserts. The steadfast stability of these ancient jungles results from recondite machines known as World Shaper Engines, which sit at the heart of these landscapes.

These massive monuments, crafted from neither metal nor stone, take the form of pyramid-shaped structures that emit a soft hum as their parts shift in strange rhythmic unity, releasing blue sparks. At the top, rotating rings float around a large glowing sphere that hovers above the structure like a celestial body. These devices were created by elder beings to reshape the world in accordance with their race’s grand design. Embedded in the earth’s crust, the machines harvest ley lines of magic that run through the world, unleashing waves of energy that split the sky and shatter the earth, brutally sculpting the environment around them. This powerful terraforming can transform the most desolate landscapes into jungles brimming with life in mere days.

As decades pass, the creators of these altars vanish, leaving their great inventions behind. Without further guidance, the World Shaper Engines continue to maintain their habitats for untold epochs. Many younger races have greedily attempted to poach and plunder the rare flora and fauna that cling to existence around the Engines. When these Engines detect disruptions to their ecosystems’ balance, they take action to correct the disturbance. They can conjure deadly storms and earthquakes from miles away, sweeping away entire encampments of foreign invaders as though they were mere piles of sand.

If such measures fail to deter foolhardy profiteers, the Engines also profoundly affect the local inhabitants they foster, infusing them with near-limitless vitalizing energies. Beasts become saturated with unmatched ferocity, able to heal from the most grievous wounds inflicted upon them. Meanwhile, vines and branches grow and flow like serpents, tangling and pinning outlanders as claws and teeth bring an end to their meddling.


However, there are tales of mighty Engines that do not merely remain stationary to defend their territories. Stories speak of machines that suffer great damage and repair themselves improperly, causing their influence to grow unchecked. Beasts proliferate uncontrollably, spilling into neighboring lands and wreaking untold desolation. 

\columnbreak

On rare occasions, the ancient lizardfolk, who worship the original creators of the Engines, can discern how to command them. 

It is said that a priest with the highest affinity for magic may recite incantations left by the old ones in a grand ritual, causing the Engine to uproot itself and drift weightlessly into the air. It soars high in the heavens, only to return over the horizon as a blazing light and crash with thunderous impact. The devoted lizardfolk march forward, following the sight of their fallen star, while in the distance, the Engine embeds itself in a newly formed impact zone, preparing to unleash a torrent of growth to overtake the land in the name of the old ones.

### World Shaper Engine Encounters

## Saurian Astrolyph Bearers
*Lizardmen Bearing Artifacts Radiating Arcane Energy*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Arcane <br>
The lizardfolk known as saurians are said to follow a grand cosmic plan laid out by ancient beings who reshaped the world in ages past. Their devotion to these ancients stems not from faith but from an instinct as innate as their need to eat. This intuitive reverence is so profound that when a saurian encounters relics of their bygone gods, a surge of deep devotion drives them to perform strange actions or even operate devices of remarkable complexity through sheer intuition.

No artifact exemplifies this connection more than the astrolyph, a peculiar disc carved from meteoric rock and adorned with the symbols of the old ones, etched in rings across its surface. Neither the saurians nor the servants of these ancient beings fully understand the true purpose of these forgotten discs. Yet, when an astrolyph is discovered by a group of saurians, it becomes immediately clear—without deliberation—that one among them is destined to bear the sacred object and serve as its protector. Often, this responsibility is preordained, with the chosen saurian already marked for the role before the astrolyph is even found.

Though its ultimate function remains a mystery, the saurians carry these discs on ornate golden rods, hoisting them aloft like banners of war. Through these symbols, they harness the light of the heavens, channeling it into radiant beams that rain down upon the earth. Saurians bathed in this luminescence find their wounds healed and gain the resilience to withstand devastating attacks. Conversely, those who oppose the will of the old gods find their flesh seared by the astrolyph’s radiance, their defenses weakened and vulnerable to the ripping jaws and blades of the lizardfolk.

The strength of these rays grows the longer the bearer channels the cosmic power of the heavens. This power can be further amplified through rituals, as other spellcasters lend their incantations to the effort. At its peak, the astrolyph’s brilliance can envelop a battlefield in pale blue light, purging foes with its searing radiance. While the astrolyph is a potent weapon and ward, its capabilities extend far beyond what is understood. Many structures and contraptions from the old ones’ golden age contain slots designed to perfectly hold these mysterious discs. On the rare occasions when an astrolyph is united with such machinery, the grand powers of the ancient beings are unlocked—for better or worse.

### Saurian Astrolyph Bearer Tactics
The saurian astrolyph bearer supports allied saurian fighters from the backline, using its Celestial Light to envelop a large group of enemies and allies. Allies should gather within the light’s area to gain its benefits. Once enemies are immobilized, the astrolyph bearer advances into the light to recover hit points and engage in melee combat. It reserves its bite attack for when it enters a Rampage.

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.

## Chakatl, The Eternal Warden
*Supreme Bodyguard of The Ancient Mage-Priests*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Armaments, Individual <br>
Among the saurian temple guard, tasked with protecting the venerated sload mage priests who rule over the lizardfolk, only a select few are entrusted with the most crucial duties. These duties involve watching over the oldest and most powerful mage priests, who reside within the ancient City of Stars and hibernate in the great temples of this ancient settlement. The death of such beings, who possess vast knowledge and power, would be an irretrievable loss to the lizardfolk.

It is Chakatl who now takes up the mantle of Eternal Warden, ever watchful for any threat that might befall his sacred charges. This stalwart bodyguard is aware of even the slightest disturbance in the air or the faintest of sounds. In addition to his own extraordinary perception, Chakatl wears the skull of the first temple guard atop his head, its lingering spirit amplifying his senses so that no foe can ambush him. Over the centuries, all assassination attempts on the mage priests under Chakatl’s guardianship have been crushed without effort or hesitation. 

Wielding the massive Star-Stone Mace with precision, Chakatl delivers earth-shattering blows that would reduce a normal human soldier to nothing but a red stain. Should a transgressor possess great power and manage to survive such a devastating blow, they will find all enchantments upon them nullified. Additionally, Chakatl bears a great key hanging about his neck, a artifact of the Temple of the Star City, which grants him the power to slow time itself around his enemies. To this day, none under Chakatl’s protection have ever fallen.

### Chakatl Tactics
Chakatl's primary role is to protect his Sacred Charge and keep them alive. He engages the largest group of enemies to draw attention and control the battlefield.

#### Actions
* **Tossing Bite:** Chakatl uses his Tossing Bite to reposition enemies. He targets melee combatants to move them away from his Sacred Charge or to group enemies together so he can make better use of his Eternal Warden and Key of Eternity traits.
* **Star-Stone Mace:** When striking with his Star-Stone Mace, Chakatl prioritizes enemies that either have the most magic items, that are knocked prone from his Tossing Bite, or that have been slowed by his Key of Eternity.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Reactions
* **Intercept:** Chakatl uses Intercept to disrupt as many enemy attacks and spells as possible. He positions himself adjacent to the attacker, ensuring his Eternal Warden trait applies to the creature targeting his Sacred Charge.
* **Warden's Strike:** When an enemy attempts to escape, either by disengaging, teleporting, or using interplanar travel, Chakatl uses Warden's Strike to deny their retreat.
    *  **Use Tossing Bite** to throw them away from his Sacred Charge if the target is a melee combatant with low Strength.
    *  **Otherwise, use his Star-Stone Mace** to deal greater damage and suppress magical items.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.

>
> ***Warden's Strike.*** *Trigger:* A creature within 5 feet of Chakatl takes the Disengage action, attempts to teleport, or uses interplanar travel.<br>
> *Response:* Chakatl makes an opportunity attack against the creature. On a hit, the creature’s speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. If the creature was attempting to teleport or use interplanar travel, the effect fails and the spell or ability is wasted.
