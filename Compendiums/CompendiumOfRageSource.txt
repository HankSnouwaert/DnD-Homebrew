# Demonic Compendium of Rage
Demons of rage are born from the innate aggression of mortals, and thrive in times of war.  They are the living embodiments of rage, bloodlust, and warmongering.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently, rampaging across existence in their endless desire for battle and bloodshed.  On others, they serve as soldiers to one or more mighty demon lords or demonic gods who preside over the domains of rage, blood, and conquest.     

***Mortal Followers.*** In addition to demons, the forces of rage include mortals who are fueled by anger, revel in acts of violent destruction, and are masters of brutal combat. They are blessed with enhanced combat prowess fueled by the unholy fury associated with demons of rage. Those affected this way can range from humanoid warriors to monstrous creatures of the mortal realm afflicted by demonic exposure, all of whom become vessels of fiendish fury who wish only to see the world burn.

***Call to War.*** While most demons are known for brutality and murder, demons of rage embody these aspects in their purest form.  War and aggression are their succor, and these fiends incite mortals into bloody conflict wherever they roam. While demons of rage are more than eager enough to wage war directly, their presence alone drives mortals to greater levels of aggression and brutality.  

Under the influence of these demons, armies lose all restraint, once peaceful villages are consumed in bloody riots, and people across the land rally for war.  

***Brutal and Direct.***  The forces of rage eschew indirect tactics such as guile, deception, or sorcery.  They view these methods as a sign of weakness and despise all who employ them.  Demons of rage and their mortal followers engage their enemies head-on, relying on overwhelming aggression and superior strength at arms to crush their foes.  While the forces of rage are not stupid and possess masterful skills in combat, they rarely allow the niceties of complex battlefield tactics to interfere with their need for brutal slaughter and mayhem.

***Hatred of Magic.***  While many demons and demon worshipers utilize innate arcane abilities to achieve their depraved ends, the forces of rage condemn the use of magic. To them, spellcraft is a cowardly and despicable substitute for martial prowess, and they only utilize magic in the form of enchanted arms and armor. The disdain for magic the forces of rage hold is reflected in how easily they can shrug off any sorcery that would attempt to subdue them. Demons of rage have an innate resistance to magical effects, and their mortal followers often forge armaments that help them negate any spells that would deny them glorious, bloody, unimpeded combat.

# Running Demonic Rage Adventures 

Demons of rage represent the burning hatred for the world mortals carry in their hearts and the dark urge to violently tear it all apart. They are drawn to people and places rife with violence and are fueled by the inability of mortals to make peace with the world as it is, thus allowing frustration and bitterness to boil over into conflict. Mortals who seek to enhance their power so that they may better unleash their rage upon the world may make pacts with these demons, forfeiting their souls for greater strength and martial powers.

Players are most likely to encounter these demons when they’ve been summoned by such mortals. But demons of rage may also spawn in locations where violence and rage run rampant. A bloody battlefield, a countryside plagued by violent raiding, or a city gripped by riots are all places where demons of rage may manifest themselves and begin their brutal rampage.

Mortal followers of rage or creatures warped by its demonic influence have fewer hindrances navigating the Material Plane and can appear in almost any location. However, the longer they linger in an area and spread the destructive influence of rage, the more likely that actual demons of rage will begin to spawn.

### Forces of Rage Motivations

Demons of rage and creatures warped by their influence have brutal appearances that reflect the uncontrollable hatred they carry. They are straightforward creatures with little guile and seek only to inflict their hatred upon the world as violently as possible. They don't scheme, manipulate, seduce, or whittle away the subject of their hatred; indirect means of action are a frustrating sign of weakness, and weakness and vulnerability are anathema to their existence. 

While creatures of rage are not necessarily stupid, their motivations are usually simple. They are angry. There is something or someone that anger is being directed at. They seek to bring that anger to bear against said something or someone using violent means. All other goals and motivations revolve around achieving greater means of enacting violence.

When role-playing creatures of rage, anger is the obvious emotion to lean into. The degree to which the anger is expressed can vary from mindless fury to a controlled but intense simmer. Many creatures of rage are prone to reckless action, which can quickly make their behavior predictable. The most dangerous among them are tactful in how and when they unleash their fury, and you can make a creature of rage surprisingly frightening by being subtle about the hatred boiling just beneath the surface, waiting to erupt when players least suspect it.


#### Common Creature of Rage Motivations
* Unleash violence on a hated enemy
* Incite violence among mortals
* Battle with worthy adversaries to enhance skills
* Aquire powerful armaments of war

### Creature of Rage Tactics
These creatures share many similar characteristics that lead to certain fighting styles. 

***High Damage.*** The forces of rage are usually more focused on offense over defense and capable of inflicting large amounts of damage very quickly. Some focus more on single-target damage, and others on groups, but they will all seek to attack foes as quickly as possible.

***Melee Oritanted.*** The forces of rage usually have better melee options than ranged options. There are exceptions to this, but it is usually in their best interest to close the distance foes as quickly as possible and prevent them from fleeing combat.

***Anti-Magic.*** The forces of rage generally don't utilize magical spells. They rely on strong anti-magic defense to negate enemy spellcasters and level the playing field. 

***Low Defense.*** Outside of abilities that negate magical interference, the forces of rage usually have lackluster defensive stats and abilities. They rely on ending the fight quickly through high damage.

#### Engagement

Demons of rage rely on speed rather than stealth to rapidly engage players in combat. Their fragility and lack of ranged firepower means they are at the greatest disadvantage before closing the distance with players, so they must prioritize moving in as quickly as possible. If possible, they should rush fragile, ranged damage dealers first.

#### Combat

Despite being relatively fragile, the forces of rage show little concern for their well-being. However, they will prioritize attacking the "glass cannon" players who are the greatest threat to them and the easiest to kill. Thus, their greatest defense is to go completely on the offensive. Even relatively unintelligent creatures of rage will instinctively gang up on targets to bring them down as quickly as possible, and the intelligent ones will find more sophisticated ways to quickly eliminate soft targets that are a more significant threat.

#### Retreat
The forces of rage will rarely retreat, even when on their home plane where death would be permanent. Their fury makes retreat almost impossible, even when commanded to pull back by those leading them. As such, commanders leading forces of rage will never count on being able to execute a tactical withdrawal or even pulling their forces back once they're engaged.

## Primal Path

### Path of the Demon Soul
Barbarians who follow this accursed path discover a demonic presence within themselves, yearning for release. This presence may be the result of a demonic curse, overexposure to Abyssal magics, or even demonic possession. In any case, when these barbarians lose control, their fiendish nature manifests itself visibly, warping their appearance and allowing them to unleash an unholy fury upon their foes.


#### Demonic Surges
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
The dark powers coursing through you give you access to demonic abilities in the form of Demonic Surges. Demonic Surges are supernatural abilities that momentarily boost your combat abilities or create fiendish spell-like effects. You use your Strength modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Demonic Surge and when making an attack roll with one. If you are raging, you may add your rage damage to any one damage roll made as a result of a Demonic Surge. Using a Demonic Surge also counts as making an attack that round for the purposes of maintaining your rage.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

<div align="center"> 

**Surge save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

**Surge attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

</div>

**Surge Slots.** The Demonic Surges table shows how many surge slots you have to use Demonic Surges of 1st level and higher. To use one of these surges, you must expend a slot of the surge's level or higher. You regain all expended Surge Slots when you complete a long rest.

**Surges Known of 1st-Level and Higher.** You know three 1st-level Demonic Surges of your choice from the list Demonic Surges section, which starts on the next page.

The Surges Known column of the Demon Soul Surges table shows when you learn more Demonic Surges of 1st level or higher.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the surges you know with another surge of your choice. This surge must be of a level for which you have surge slots.

#### Fiendish Resilience 
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
Your demonic nature grants you increased resistance to elemental forces. You now have resistance to lightning, fire, and cold damage while raging.

#### Reckless Surge
*6th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>

You may apply your Reckless Attack feature to any attacks you make as part of your Demonic Surges. Additionally, when you use a Demonic Surge that requires creatures to make a saving throw, you may choose to force all affected creatures to make their saving throw with disadvantage. If you do, all attack rolls against you have advantage and all saving throws you make have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.


#### Brutal Surge
*10th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
You may apply your Brutal Critical feature to any attacks you make with your Demonic Surges. Additionally, when you use your Reckless Surge or Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to have your Demonic Surges ignore all resistances and treat all immunity as though it is resistance until the start of your next turn. Doing so causes you to lose all resistances granted by your rage until the start of your next turn.


#### Chaos Conduit
*14th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
While raging, you may use a 1st level demonic surge without expending a Surge Slot. You can use this ability only once per rage.

#### Demonic Surges
The surges are grouped by surge level and listed alphabetically. 

##### 1st Level Surges
&emsp;**Abyssal Skulk.**  As an action, you magically turn invisible. The invisibility lasts for 1 minute or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force a creature to make a saving throw.

**Arrogant Rage.** When you enter a rage or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage such that you gain a surge of reckless confidence, allowing you to demoralize any who would dare strike you. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



While raging this way, whenever a creature makes an attack against you and would have advantage as a result of your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge features, you can use your reaction to demoralize that creature, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it loses the advantage your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge granted it and instead suffers disadvantage on the attack.
 
Creatures immune to being charmed and frightened automatically pass this save.

This surge ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.



**Burning Whip.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to summon a burning whip in a free hand that you can use to immediately make a single melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 3d6 fire damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward you. 

The whip disappears immediately after you make this attack.

**Defile Earth.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to cause the ground within 10 feet of you to become polluted with demonic ichor. The area is corrupted for the next minute, during which time it is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. 

As an action, you can cause any number of 5-foot-by-5-foot square areas covered in this ichor to burst with demonic rot, which clears that area of the ichor. Any creature standing in the burst must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

<div style='margin-top:325px;'></div>

\pagebreakNum

**Demonic Appendages.** As a bonus action, choose a damage type from piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. You cause your hands to mutate into demonic appendages (such as claws, tentacles, or skewers) for the next hour or until you dismiss this surge as a bonus action. The appendages can be used as weapons while not holding anything and count as simple melee weapons with the Light property that add your Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls when you attack with them. They each deal 1d10 of the chosen damage type on it.

**Fiendish Horns.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to grow large demonic horns and use them to make a single melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 3d8 piercing damage, and if the target is a creature and you moved at least 20 ft. before making the attack, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone, and you may push it up to 10 feet away from you.

The horns disappear immediately after making this attack.


**Flames of Chaos.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to hurl a bolt of iridescent fire at a creature within 100 feet of you as a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 fire damage and becomes engulfed in chaotic flames until the end of your next turn. 

If the creature takes damage from one of your Demonic Surges while covered in these flames,  the flames disappear, and that surge deals an additional 1d12 damage as it draws energy from the fires.

**Foul Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 2d6 poison damage. The target must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

**Fresh Meat.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to feast on the corpse of one Small or larger creature within 5 feet of you that died within the last minute, causing you to regain a number of hit points equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier.

**Hateful Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by focusing it into a hatred for another creature you can see within 90 feet of you. For the duration of this effect, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to that creature whenever you hit it with an attack. 

This surge ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

\columnbreak

**Hungering Jaws.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to attempt to bite a creature within 5 feet of you with razor-sharp jaws as a melee spell attack. On a hit, you deal 2d8 piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, you regain a number of hit points equal to the damage it dealt.

**Hypnotic Summons.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to whisper maddening words to one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you, twisting its mind and drawing it toward you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as close as its speed allows toward you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move toward you. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

**Lightning Blade.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to create a blade of chaotic lighting in a free hand that you can use to immediately make a single melee spell attack. This attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 18 or higher. On a hit, it deals 2d12 lightning damage. The blade disappears immediately after making this attack.

**Nightmare Rage.** When you enter a rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can enhance your rage by filling your mind with nightmarish visions that you can inflict upon others. While raging this way, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack or an attack from one of your Demonic Surges, you may surround the target with nightmarish visions for the next minute or until you surround another creature with visions. 

If the target willingly moves 5 feet before the visions end, it must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success, and the visions affecting it end.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge beyond what this ability allows you to maintain.

**Savage Rush.**  As a bonus action, you draw upon an unholy vigor, allowing you to move up to your movement speed horizontally in a straight line. The first creature you run into during this movement must succeed on a Strength saving or be pushed ahead of you for the rest of the movement. If the creature succeeds on the save, or you run into a second creature, your movement stops.

##### 2nd Level Surges

**Burning Smite.**  When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 3d10 fire damage.

**Cruel Revival.** As a bonus action, you speak a dark incantation which awakens the corpse of a Small or Medium creature you can see within 30 feet of you that died within the last 10 minutes. The corpse immediately stands up and becomes a **zombie** (the statistics for zombies can be found in the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your Strength ability modifier. In combat, the zombie shares your initiative count.

While the zombie is within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to mentally command it to do your bidding. If it receives no such commands, it takes no actions and does not move. 

The zombie crumbles to dust after 10 minutes.

**Demonic Eyes.** As an action, you cause your eyes to take on demonic traits and appearance. For the next 8 hours, you gain darkvision out to 120 and areas of dim light are not considered lightly obscured to you.

**Horror Nimbus.** As an action, you magically emit scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of that you that can see the light must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.


**Indestructible Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a <br> bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage to <br> make yourself nearly indestructible. While this effect <br> lasts, you have an advantage on Constitution checks <br> and saving throws and resistance to all damage <br> except radiant damage.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute <br> passes, or you enhance your rage with another <br> Demonic Surge.

**Inflicted Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a <br> bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage <br> by attempting to psychically inflict another creature <br> within 120 feet of you with it. That creature must <br> succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be <br> subjected to this rage for one minute, until your <br> rage ends, or until you enhance your rage with <br> another surge.

\columnbreak

While under the effects of this rage, the creature can only use its action to make weapon attacks or take the Dash action, and it can no longer cast or maintain concentration on spells.

The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Inhuman Grace.**  As a bonus action, you endow yourself with such unnatural grace that any you stride past have their minds rent by the sight of your movements. Until the end of your turn, whenever you move 5 feet away from a creature that can see you, it takes 2d8 psychic damage. A creature can only take this damage once per turn. 

If you used your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge features this turn, your speed also increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn.


**Insanity Gaze.**  As an action, you turn your madding gaze upon a creature you can see within 90 feet of you, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must use its movement on its next turn to move within 5 feet of a creature of your choice and then use its action to make a melee attack against that creature. If it is unable to reach the chosen creature, it does not use its action that turn.

**Malevolent Flame.** As an action, you create an area of flame that fills a 5-foot cube in front of you and move it out 30 ft. away from you, where it remains until the end of your next turn, at which point the flame moves toward your current location. The flame disappears after reaching you or moving 30 ft. toward you.

Whenever the flame moves into the space of a creature other than you, or a creature other than you ends its turn standing in the flame, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage, and on a pass, it takes half as much.

The flame ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

**Torturous Claws.** As an action, two razor-sharp clawed limbs grow from you and strike at nearby foes. Make two melee spells attacks against targets within 5 feet of you. On a hit, a target takes 2d10 slashing damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn as it is racked with pain.

If both attacks made this way hit the same target, it is afflicted with even more intense pain, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. It takes an additional 3d10 psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. 

The limbs disappear immediately after you make the attacks with them.

**Unholy Stench.** As an action, you cause a foul smell to emanate out to a 10-foot radius around yourself. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of your next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.


**Spew Bile.** As an action, you spew forth a stream of corrosive bile. Each creature in a 15-foot cone in front of you takes 4d4 acid damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is covered in acid, causing it to take another 4d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn unless a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off of it beforehand. On a successful save, a creature is not covered in acid and takes no additional damage at the end of its next turn.



**Rampaging Rage.**  When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage with an insatiable bloodlust. While under this effect, up to once on each of your turns, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack or a Demonic Surge, you gain an additional action. This action can only be used to take a Dash action or an Attack action to make one weapon attack.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

##### 3rd Level Surges

**Cackling Flail.** As an action, you choose a point you can see within 15 feet of you and conjure a three-headed demonic flail made of cackling skulls in a free hand which you use to make three melee spell attacks against up to three different creatures who are within 15 feet of the chosen point. On a hit, an attack from this flail deals 3d8 thunder damage. 

If one or more of the creatures hit by the flail is reduced to 0 hit points, you may immediately make another attack with it against each of the remaining targets who still have 1 or more hit points. If this second set of attacks reduces another creature to 0 hit points, you may repeat the process.

Once you can no longer make any attacks, the flail disappears.

**Contaminating Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage to channel it into a stream of demonic corruption that oozes into a 15-foot radius area centered on yourself. This area moves with you, and you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. 

When a creature you haven’t designated enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage, and its speed is halved while it remains in the area. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and its speed isn’t reduced.

The contaminated area disappears if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Dark Flight.** As an action, you cause wings to spring from your back granting you flying speed of 60 feet for the next 10 minutes. If the effect ends while you are in the air, you immediately begin falling unless some other effect prevents this.

\pagebreakNum

**Devour.** As an action, your jaw unhinges, and you attempt to magically swallow a Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of you that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by you. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside you, and it takes 3d4 acid damage at the start of each of your turns. 

The creature is swallowed until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell, except it can be maintained while raging). If you lose concentration, the swallowed creature is regurgitated and falls prone into a space of your choice within 5 feet of you.

**Ecstatic Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 4d8 psychic damage to it as you subject it to overwhelming bliss. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn.

**Eldritch Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by allowing maddening demonic knowledge to flood your mind. For the duration of this effect, you have advantage on all Intelligence checks and saving throws. Additionally, once per turn, you may use a 1st level Demonic Surge that replaces one of your attacks without expending a surge slot. 

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Fire Stomp.** As an action, you slam the ground, causing fire to erupt out from you to a 15-foot radius. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 fire damage. On a pass, it takes half as much damage.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Lightning Lance.** As an action, you launch a bolt of lightning in a 60-foot long 10-foot wide line. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Manic Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you channel your rage to the point of manic insanity, turning yourself into a whirlwind of death. While in this state, if you make an attack that would have advantage as a result of your Reckless Attack feature, you can forgo that advantage to make the same attack against another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within the attack’s range. These extra attacks can’t benefit from advantage from any source or be replaced with Demonic Surges. 

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Undying Evil.**  You gain the demonic ability to escape death. As an action, you place a ward on yourself that lasts for 8 hours or until you use this surge again. If you die while under the effects of the ward, your body dissolves into foul ichor, leaving behind only the equipment you were wearing or carrying. 

After 1 minute, you reform in the unoccupied space closest to the location where you died. Your soul must be both willing and able to reform, and you can’t return to life if you died of old age. 

When you reform, you return to life with 1 hit point and the ward ends.


**Warp Flesh.** As an action, you target a creature you can see within 5 feet of you and warp its body with chaotic magics. It must make a Charisma saving throw or become brittle until the end of your next turn. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

**Warp Jump.** As an action, you teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 100 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Before or after teleporting, you can make one attack as part of this action.


##### 4th Level Surges

**Bellow of Endless Fury.** As an action, you unleash a roar of fiery rage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Chaotic Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 4d10 force damage as you channel raw chaos through it. 

Additionally, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or suffer one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below until the end of your next turn.


##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight. At the end of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|

**Limb Storm** As an action, you briefly grow extra sets of demonic limbs which strike out at nearby creatures. You may make up to six melee spell attacks with these limbs as part of this action, which each deal 1d12 piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage (your choice) on hit. 

The limbs disappear immediately after you make the attacks with them.

**Oozing Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage, causing you to grow wobbling mounds of slime and flesh, which seal your wounds as you receive them. For the duration of this effect, you gain a +10 to the Constitution saving throw you make as part of your Relentless Rage feature, and you regain 1d6 hit points at the start of each of your turns.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Shared Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you can enhance your rage to inspire it in another willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature gains the following benefits until your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge:

* It has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

* When it makes its first attack on each of its turns, it can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives it advantage on melee weapon attacks, but attack rolls against it have advantage until its next turn.
* If the creature is able to cast spells, it can't cast them or concentrate on them.



**Sentient Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by focusing it into an entirely separate consciousness, which may even form itself into a new head that grows from your body. When you do so, you may choose two Demonic Surges you know that both enhance your rage and have a combined level of 4 or less. You gain the effects of both those surges until your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Soul Rend.** Your chest cracks open and projects a vortex of life-draining energy out to 30 feet from you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature that is Small or larger and dropped to 0 hit points by this effect dies, causing you to regain hit points equal to the number of hit dice it had.

**Stunning Screech.** As an action, you emit a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of you that can hear it must succeed on a DC Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. 

**Summon Demon.** You utter foul abyssal words, calling a demon forth from the chaos of the Abyss. Choose a demon of CR 5 or lower such as a **shadow demon** or a **barlgura**. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 hour has passed.

The demon obeys your commands, and in combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one that is listed in its stat block or any other action that the demon would be capable of.

### Demons Soul Barbarian Archetypes
If you have a specific type of demon or demon lord you want your barbarian to emulate the powers of, you can choose Demonic Surges that thematically fit with that demon. The following Demonic Surge lists are grouped based on common demonic themes and demon lords, though you may need to change how you describe of some of the surges to better fit the powers associated with your theme. 

Note that some surges like *demonic appendages*, *demonic eyes*, *undying evil*, and *summon demon* are so general that they can thematically fit with almost any type of demon.

### Demon Soul Adventurers
Below are some options that can be used as inspiration for your barbarian’s backstory and the origin of their powers. 

| d12  | Demon Soul Origin |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | You underwent a dark ritual in exchange for the power needed to achieve your goals |
|  2  | You hail from a demon worshiping barbarian tribe.  You've abandoned the tribe and their evil ways, but you still wield the dark forces they bestowed upon you. |
|  3  | A gateway to the Abyss opened near your home town.  You survived the ordeal, but were forever changed by its demonic energies.
|  4  | You were the subject of dark and bizarre arcane experiments.  |
|  5  | All you remember were fiends attacking your town.  Now, when you're in danger, you black out.  When you come to, you're surrounded by bodies and left with only brief flashes of what happened. |
|  6  | You took it upon yourself to trap the soul of a demon within yourself, thereby preventing it from returning to the Abyss and reforming.  |
|  7  | You were subjected to a fiendish curse which you struggle to keep from consuming your soul. |
|  8  | You have fiendish parentage, which you learned about when you came of age and your fiendish traits began manifesting. |
|  9  | You've attracted the attention of a demon lord who is bestowing its "gifts" upon you in hopes of corrupting your soul.
| 10  | You were once a demon, but sought to escape the Abyss and find redemption by reincarnating yourself as a mortal.  
| 11  | You are dedicated to fighting demons by using their own powers against them, and you've turned yourself into an unrelenting slayer who brings doom to any fiend you find. 
| 12  | Your powers aren't fiendish in nature, but have some other planar origin, such as Limbo, the Far Realm, or the Elemental Plane of Fire.

## Demon Soul Barbarian NPCs
The following stat blocks can be used to describe non-player characters who are demon soul barbarians or warriors with similar powers. You can choose the stat block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC and apply the Demonic Surges of your choice that best fit the desired theme of the NPC, as described in its Demonic Surges feature. You may also opt to provide your NPCs with fewer known surges than the stat block suggests so as to keep its combat options simpler and make it easier for players to learn its attack patterns.

To further customize your NPC, apply the racial traits of whichever humanoid race you’ve chosen for it.

> ##### Demon Barbarian Building Tips
> &#8226; Don’t add more different types of surges than you need to reach the design goal of your barbarian
> <br> &#8226; Only having one surge that enhances the barbarian’s rage makes it a lot easier to manage.
> <br> &#8226; Changing out weapons & skills or modifying mental stats are a simple ways to help differentiate the look and style of your barbarians.
<br> &#8226; If you give a barbarian the *eldritch rage* surge, it needs to know a surge that can be used in place of an attack, and it's best to allow it to use that surge as a bonus action while raging. Otherwise, it will rarely get the same resource-saving benefits as a player from the ability.

## Demon Soul Barbarian Examples
The following is a list of example stat blocks made using the demon soul barbarian templates. The barbarian examples don’t always know as many surges as their template stat block suggests. Rather than using surge slots, the different demonic surge abilities each have a certain number of uses. Other modifications include tweaking non-combat stats, swapping out weapons, or replacing the rage feature with the one enhanced by a known demonic surge. All these changes are made to enhance the theme of the barbarian and streamline its stat block for readability.

## Magic Items <br> of Rage
Powerful demons or barbarian tribes of <br> war and rage will sometimes craft magical <br> items  which channel their bloodthirsty <br> powers.  They may wield these items <br> themselves or gift them to worthy warriors. <br> The following magic items can be used to <br> represent these gifts  of rage in your campaign.

#### Armor of Wrath 1.0.0
*Armor (heavy), very rare, 6,000g*<br>

Forged in demonic flames and cooled in the <br> blood of slain warriors, this crimson armor poses <br> little hindrance to those whose hearts burn with rage.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. 

Additionally, if you have at least three levels in the barbarian class, you are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with heavy armor, and you retain the full benefits of your Rage and Fast Movement barbarian class features while wearing this armor.

#### Blood Blade 1.0.0
*Weapon(greatsword), rare, 1,500g*<br>

This massive sword was forged with bloodthirsty instincts.  If a strike from this blade lands correctly, it will drink deep of its victim's life force.  

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.   

Additionally, when you roll the damage dice for an attack you make with the weapon, if at least two of the damage dice roll the same result, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage.  If both of these damage dice roll the same result, repeat this process until both dice don't roll the same result.


#### Carnage Axe 1.0.0
*Weapon (any axe), very rare, 9,000gp*<br>
This unholy axe has been forged from bloodsoaked brass fused with demonic souls.  Ever eager for combat, the souls are roused when they sense multiple enemies nearby.

You have advantage on attack rolls made with this weapon as long as there are two or more hostile creatures within 5 feet of you that aren't incapacitated.

#### Collar of Scorn 1.0.0
*Wondrous item, legendary, 50,000gp*<br>
This brass collar is inscribed with powerful runes that ward off all magic that would target the wearer, as well as any magic the wearer would attempt to utilize.

While wearing this collar, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, spell attacks have disadvantage against you, and you have resistance to damage from spells.

***Curse.*** Once you don this collar, you can't doff it unless it is targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While wearing the collar, you can't cast or concentrate on spells. You are also not affected by spells unless they would damage you, force you to make a saving throw, reduce your movement speed, or inflict other negative effects.

#### Mask of the Destroyer 1.0.0
*Wondrous item, very rare, 9,000gp*<br>

This fearsome mask of brass aids its wearer in bloody murder, but those who fail to appease its bloodlust are punished harshly.

When you take the attack action, you may choose to activate the mask's powers.  If you do, until the end of your turn, when you make a melee weapon attack and miss, you can reroll the attack.  You must use the new result. 

At the end of a turn in which you activated the mask, if you have not killed or reduced a creature to 0 hit points this turn with a weapon attack, you take 6d6 necrotic damage. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.

# Creatures <br> of Rage

## Bloodrenders

These demonic warriors sport massive horns, blood-red hides, and a skull-like visage whose eyes burn with endless rage. Bloodrenders wield mighty hellblades with brutal skill and often serve as demonic footsoldiers. They attack with unrestrained brutality, feeding off the aggression and violence of combat. Bloodrenders fighting together will drive each other to greater heights of hatred, cutting through enemies in a maddened frenzy.

Bloodrenders often make up the bulk of demonic armies in service to demon lords of war and hatred. In some worlds, they slaughter in the name of a specific master, while in others, they serve as demonic footsoldiers utilized by multiple demon lords.  

Bloodrenders are often encountered in small roving warbands but can sometimes form the backbone of world-ending demonic armies.   While they are deadly and unrelenting warriors, their single-minded need for slaughter usually prohibits them from performing complex long-term strategies. For bloodrenders, combat is an end unto itself.  

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Several creatures of rage throughout this document use the Berserk condition. Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
> * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it >can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.

> ##### Rage Riders
> If you wish to have any bloodrender you're using ride a controlled mount, you can give it the following trait:<br> ***Rage Rider.*** If the bloodrender has a controlled mount that is also a demon of rage, the mount can take the Attack action once on each of the bloodrender's turns and use its bonus action on its turn. If it takes this action, the mount cannot take Dash, Disengage, and Dodge on that turn.

***Exalted Bloodrenders.*** Some <br> bloodrenders are considered the elite <br> among their kin. These demons may <br> have been particularly formidable and <br> brutal mortal warriors whose souls were <br> forged into especially powerful demonic <br> forms upon death, or they may have been <br> "ordinary" blood renders whose bloody deeds <br> earned them  their master's blessing, allowing them <br> to ascend in rank. These "exalted" bloodrenders are fueled  by a hatred that makes them harder to kill and drives them into a berserk frenzy whenever they spill the blood of their foes.

***The Hellforged.*** Some bloodrenders carry such levels of hate that it threatens to tear their bodies apart from within. The most strongwilled of these bloodrenders refuse to die such an ignominious death, and some have held themselves together by having bands of demonic iron welded across their body by fiendish smiths. These searing metal scraps are bolted onto the demon's flesh through a torturous process that ensures its form will continue to house the burning rancor within.

Known as the Hellforged, these bloodrenders keep themselves held together only so they may continue to spite the world. With their every action, they seek to inflict as much damage as possible, their attacks striking at their foes' vulnerabilities with frightening ease. The Hellforged constantly move from one battle to the next, pausing only to weld their forms back together so they may continue to punish the world for the excruciating malice they must bear.

***Bloodrender Commanders.*** The most powerful among the bloodrenders become warlords commanding entire armies of bloodthirsty demons. Their superior martial skills are matched only by their rage, which drives them into an insane fury on the battlefield, and they serve as burning beacons to other demonic followers of rage who eagerly follow them into battle. The bloodreavers are the lesser commanders who lead small roving warbands, while the heralds of rage are mighty warlords who can command entire legions of demonic warriors.

These commanders draw power from violence and so inspire their followers to ever greater acts of carnage and mayhem. For many, even violence inflicted against them and their followers only serves to bolster their fury, thus perpetuating their cycle of violence. These fiends even possess the ability to curse foes with their hatred, causing every blow dealt to the marked victim to spill gratuitous amounts of blood, ensuring even the mightiest warriors will eventually succumb to the endless rage.

#### Alternate Locus Abilities
You can replace the Locus of Wrath trait of Bloodreavers or Heralds of Rage with one of the following alternative abilities to customize your bloodrender and the demonic force it's leading:

***Locus of Warding.*** The bloodrender and each demon of rage within 30 feet of it has resistance to damage from spells.
 
 ***Locus of Fury.*** All demons of rage within 30 feet of the bloodrender count as being within 10 feet of each other for the purposes of the Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide abilities.

### Bloodrender Tactics
Bloodrenders are nimble melee shock troops. Below are some tips for using them most effectively:
* Keep them in groups to maximize the effectiveness of their Murderous Tide ability. 
* They are fragile, so strike hard and fast. 
* They have high attack bonuses, so you can use them to bring down tanky targets with high AC.

#### Exalted and Hellforged Bloodrenders
* Try to trigger Hungering Blade by attacking whoever is the closest to 0 hit points.
* Have the bloodthirsters work together to trigger Hungering Blade with their Merciless Tide ability.

#### Bloodreavers & Heralds of Rage
These bloodrenders serve as commanders and should take up central positions among other demons of rage to make the most use of Merciless Tide. They have two new abilities to consider:

**Bloodmark:** This ability should be activated when two or more demons have engaged in melee combat with an opponent. Don't use it early; otherwise, the marked enemy will have the chance to retreat.

**Revel In Slaughter:** Use this ability early in the fight once most of the bloodrender's allies are within attack range. Don't save this for everyone to get hit by debilitating effects, as that is too hard to predict. 

##### Locus of Rage Abilities
&emsp;**Locus of Fury.** This ability allows the bloodrenders to spread out while still reaping the benefits of Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide. It is useful when the enemy attempts to slow down or separate the bloodrenders or when a bloodrender needs to engage a spellcaster or ranged attacker.

**Locus of Warding.** This ability is designed to protect the bloodrenders from area-of-effect damaging spells. It greatly benefits the bloodrenders since they need to be close to each other to make the most of their Murderous Tide ability.

**Locus of Wrath.** With this ability, the bloodrender's minions can adopt an even more reckless attack strategy. However, if the leader is destroyed early, the minions will never reap the benefits of this ability.

#### Rage Riders
Bloodrenders typically ride juggernauts, which can knock their prey prone. As such, the juggernaut should attack first so the bloodrender can gain advantage against the prone target. Additionally, remember that the juggernaut is a demon of rage, allowing it to contribute to the Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide abilities.

### Bloodrender Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Bloodrender Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Juggernauts

These infernal constructs are not born of flesh but are forged in the hellish fires of their fiendish realm, their bodies a horrific blend of demon spirit and enchanted metal. Encased in armor that is as much a part of them as their sinew and bone, these juggernauts bear the unholy symbols of their patrons, radiating malevolence and the promise of doom. Their eyes, ablaze with the fires of chaos, seek out the souls of the living with a hunger that is as eternal as the gods they serve. On the battlefield, these demonic engines serve as mounts for the mightiest of demonic warriors, their combined fury an unstoppable force of destruction.

In the throes of battle, juggernauts are a horrifying sight to behold. Their armored forms are impervious to all but the most powerful blows, making them virtually invincible to the common soldier. With each thunderous step, they cause the earth itself to tremble, sowing fear and chaos in the hearts of their foes. These beasts do not simply fight; they obliterate, crushing enemy lines under their massive hooves and goring the survivors with their razor-sharp horns. The bond between a juggernaut and its rider is forged in the crucible of war and chaos, creating a synergy of violence and rage that few can withstand.

Only the mightiest of warriors and demons are deemed worthy to mount these colossal beasts as steeds. To earn the right to ride a juggernaut is to be recognized as a champion of the demonic forces of rage, a living symbol of their favor, and a vessel of their destructive will. The bloody path to earning such a devastating steed is fraught with peril, for it requires a warrior or demon of exceptional strength, will, and devotion to the dark powers. Those who succeed are granted unparalleled power on the battlefield, their names feared and revered in equal measure. The sight of these fearsome riders atop their juggernaut steeds is a portent of doom , heralding an unstoppable onslaught of demonic rage.

***Searing Juggernauts.*** These infernal constructs radiate an aura of intense, searing heat, which causes the air around them to shimmer with the heat of a thousand flames. This aura not only incinerates the flesh of their foes but also makes everything in their vicinity far more susceptible to fire. This unique ability synergizes devastatingly with the fiery attacks of their allies, allowing even the smallest spark to erupt into a raging inferno. In the midst of battle, searing juggernauts are akin to moving epicenters of firestorms, where their mere presence ensures that the battlefield becomes a fiery hellscape.

##### Juggernaut Adventures

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Juggernaut of War:** The players find a keep besieged by a force of demonic rage led by a fearsome warlord atop a juggernaut. The adventurers are part of a desperate mission to infiltrate the army and eliminate the warlord and his steed in hopes of breaking the siege.|
|  2  |**The Juggernaut Blade:** Rumors have surfaced of a weapon capable of controlling or destroying juggernauts, last seen in the hands of a notorious demon-worshiping cult. The adventurers are tasked with finding and resting the weapon from their grip before they can muster a juggernaut attack force.    |
|  3  |**Juggernaut Hunt:** A powerful warlord has announced a juggernaut hunt where champions from across the harsh badlands seek to prove their worth by capturing or slaying a juggernaut in the nearby demonic wastes. The adventurers, drawn by the promise of glory and riches, must not only face the demonic beasts of the wastes but also rival hunters. |
|  4  | **Forest in Flames:** Within a remote forest, several searing juggernauts being ridden by bloodrenders rampage through the woods, setting the trees ablaze and hunting the forest elves within who are desperate for help in stopping the demons before their home is reduced to ash. |

### Juggernaut Tactics
Juggernauts serve as shock cavalry, often mounted by bloodletters. In combat, a juggernaut charges targets to knock them prone and stomp them. It will then stay in melee range to keep its prey from fleeing without risking an opportunity attack. At the start of its next turn, if the juggernaut has 30 or more hit points, it will back up and charge the target again.

#### Searing Juggernauts
Searing juggernauts prefer to engage groups of enemies, maximizing the impact of their Mantle of Immolation. They are most effective when paired with creatures that deal fire damage. Since the Mantle of Immolation can be triggered once per turn, a searing juggernaut can activate this ability on its own turn with its Gore or Pulverizing Stomp attacks and on the enemies turn if the creature ends it's in the juggernaut aura.  


### Juggernaut Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check.  





\columnbreak

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Juggernaut Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Rage Hounds

These fiends are literal dogs of war. They <br> have the appearance of blood-red canines with <br> demonic features whose fanged maws glow with <br> infernal heat.  They charge across the field of battle in bloodthirsty hunting packs, constantly searching for their next victims.  The demonic howl of a rage hound boils the air, cooking entire regiments of foes in an instant.  Wounded survivors are then set upon with claws and teeth capable of crushing through armor, and any who attempt to flee are quickly hunted down and ripped to bloody shreds.

Rage hounds are often used as beasts of war and hunting dogs by demonic masters.  Unfortunate souls who have earned the ire of such a demon may find themselves pursued by these tireless hunters.  For once a rage hound gets the scent of its prey, it does not rest until its quarry's mangled body is delivered to its master.

To ensure no magic interferes with the rage hound's hunt, each fiend is fitted with a runic collar that wards off spellcraft. Rage hounds have a special hatred for magic users and are trained to prioritize the slaughter of such individuals. In battle, demonic commanders often use rage hounds as anti-magic minions, utilizing their mobility and magic resistance to quickly run down and shred enemy mages before they can interfere with combat.

### Rage Hound Blood Hunters

These fiends are the reincarnated souls of history's most ruthless hunters, whose insatiable bloodlust and savagery in life cursed them to live their demonic afterlives as murder-crazed canines. These creatures stand apart from their kin as more recklessly brutal and bloodthirsty with an even more powerful runic collar, which makes it all but impossible for spellcasters to impede their advance. 

These hounds are unleashed for the most formidable of pursuits, their presence signifying a relentless and deadly hunt that spares no one. Legends of their exploits recount the destruction of mighty forces, the demise of powerful wielders of magic, and the downfall of creatures thought invincible. Their prowess is unmatched, especially against those who harness magic, making them a deadly force against all who stand in their way.

The tale of these rage hounds serves as a dire warning about the price of indulging in the primal thrill of the hunt. They are the embodiment of the predator's spirit, both revered and feared for their unmatched ferocity. 
To be targeted by the Blood Hunt is to confront an inescapable truth: their hunt knows no bounds, no mercy, and no end.

### Rage Hound Tactics
Rage hounds are specifically designed to target backline spellcasters. Below are some tips for using them most effectively:
* Have them make a beeline for any spellcaster they see; their spell resistance and mage hunter traits will keep magic from slowing them down.
* If they can't reach a target concentrating on a spell, try to hit the said target with Burning Howl.
* Try to surround spellcasters with multiple rage hounds to prevent escape.

#### Blood Hunters
* Their Collar of Nullification means they are even better at preventing themselves from being impeded by spells than normal rage hounds.
* Spell casters that deal high damage are still a major threat and should be the highest priority targets.
* Remember that Gore Feast can be triggered twice per round, once on the rage hound's turn and again when it makes an attack of opportunity or uses its Mage Slayer reaction.
* The extra damage potential from Gore Feast and Mage Slayer means these rage hounds will risk taking significant damage to reach enemy spell casters.

## Skull Cannon
Forged in the infernal forges that burn eternally in the heart of the netherworld, these wheeled engines of destruction are the product of demonic smiths who imbue their creations with a blend of dark magic and twisted metal. Armed with cannons that belch forth flaming skulls, these engines of war are designed for both terror and obliteration. Ridden into battle by demons who revel in carnage, skull cannons are as much a symbol of demonic might as they are instruments of war, their approach heralding a storm of fire and death.

The construction of a skull cannon is a vile alchemy of flesh and metal, with its structure housing a gaping maw capable of devouring those unfortunate enough to be caught in its path. This horrific feature serves a purpose beyond mere intimidation; the souls and bones of the devoured are transmuted within the bowels of the cannon, their essence fueling the dark sorceries that allow the cannon to unleash its deadly projectiles. Each skull fired from its depths carries with it the anguish and fury of the damned, seeking out the enemies of its masters with a malevolent intent, exploding in hellfire upon impact.

The use of skull cannons in the vanguard of demonic armies serves a dual purpose. Not only do they soften enemy lines with their relentless barrage, but the very act of their feeding and firing sows terror among those who witness it. The skulls of the devoured victims, now ammunition for the cannon, are a grim reminder of the fate that awaits those who fall before these demonic engines

***Blood Shrines.*** Blood shrines serve as alternative demonic engines to skull cannons, distinguished by their lack of artillery and the presence of demonic altars from which blood ceaselessly flows. These altars are capable of instilling a surge of bloodlust in allies, empowering them with a relentless desire for battle. Unlike their skull cannon counterparts, blood shrines utilize the devoured victims not as ammunition, but as a source of unholy power, fueling the shrine's ability to enhance the ferocity of its demonic adherents. This gruesome synergy between sacrifice and empowerment makes the blood shrine a terrifying presence on any battlefield, bolstering the forces of rage with supernatural vigor.

##### Skull Cannon Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Siege of Skulls:** A city is under siege by a cult that has constructed a skull cannon outside its walls. The adventurers must sneak out of the city, navigate through enemy lines, and find a way to destroy or sabotage the skull cannon before it breaches the city's defenses and unleashes chaos within its walls.|
|  2  |**The Forbidden Forge:** Rumors have surfaced of a hidden forge where skull cannons are being constructed. The adventurers are tasked with locating this forge, which is said to be guarded by a cabal of dark sorcerers and their demonic minions. Infiltrating the forge presents an opportunity not only to halt the production of these terrifying engines but also to uncover ancient secrets of demonic engineering. |
|  3  | **The Skull Harvest:** A village is plagued by raids from a cult seeking skulls to fuel their skull cannon. The adventurers are hired to protect the village and put an end to these raids. However, they soon discover that the cult's true target is an ancient burial ground said to contain the skulls of legendary warriors. Preventing the desecration of this sacred site and stopping the cult requires cunning, bravery, and perhaps the aid of the spirits resting there.|
|  4  | **The Blood March:** A warlord has harnessed the power of a blood shrine to imbue his army with unnatural strength and ferocity, threatening to overrun neighboring territories. The adventurers must find a way to infiltrate his heavily guarded encampment, destroy the shrine, and break the spell over his soldiers before his campaign of terror can go any further. |

> ___
> ***Brass Body.*** The skull cannon is made of demon flesh and brass fused as one. It counts as a construct for effects such as the *cure wounds* spell and a ranger’s Primeval Awareness ability.
>
> ***Heavy Treads.*** The skull cannon has advantage on saving throws and checks made against effects that would knock it prone or move it against its will. It must also spend all of its movement to stand up and can't squeeze through spaces.
>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The skull cannon is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The skull cannon has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The skull cannon can use its Burning Skull, then makes an attack.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the skull cannon. A swallowed creature is Blinded and Restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the skull cannon, and takes 7 (2d6) fire damage plus 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the skull cannon's turns. The skull cannon regains hit points equal to the damage dealt to creatures inside it this way. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and is turned to ash, and the skull cannon regains a use of its Burning Skull ability if the creature was Small or larger and had a skull.
>
> The skull cannon can have up to three targets swallowed at a time. A creature trapped inside the skull cannon can make a DC 17 Strength check as an action. On a success, one swallowed creature of their choice is freed, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the skull cannon. If the skull cannon dies, a swallowed creature is no longer Restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the skull cannon moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, it can make a Bite attack against the same target as a bonus action, whether it hit or missed.
>
> ***Burning Skull (2/day).*** The skull cannon targets a point 30 to 300 feet away from it that it or a creature mounted on it can see, and fires a burning skull. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage plus 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
>
> If the Skull Cannon uses this action, creatures outside the Skull Cannon can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach.

### Blood Shrine Variant
You can use an alternate version of this monster known as a blood shrine. To do so, make the following changes to the skull cannon's stat block.
* Replace the Burning Skull feature with Surge of Bloodletting, described below: <br>
***Surge of Bloodletting (2/Day).*** The blood shrine targets up to three other allied demons of rage it can see within 60 feet of it. Each of those targets that can see the blood shrine can use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make one melee attack with advantage.
* Replace the skull catapult's Multiattack action with the following:<br>
***Multiattack.*** The blood shrine makes an attack or uses Reckless Drift, then may use Surge of Bloodletting.

* Change the skull Cannon's Bite attack so that creatures that die while swallowed by it recharge a use of its Surge of Bloodletting rather than Burning Skull. 


### Skull Cannon Tactics
Below are the general attack sequences the skull cannon will follow. It is extremely unintelligent and will not deviate from this attack pattern much unless guided by other creatures. Additionally, without the guidance of other creatures, it may not be able to identify ideal targets for some of its attacks as specified in the strategies below.

**While the skull cannon has Burning Skull available:**
1. Fire Burning Skull at the largest group of opponents; if there are no opponents grouped together, fire at the opponent that appears the least dexterous.
2. Charge at a nearby enemy that appears to have low Strength and Dexterity and attempt to swallow it.
3. Repeat the above steps until Burning Skull is no longer available, at which point repeat step 2.

#### Creatures Mounted on the Skull Cannon
Most skull cannons are guided by two or more bloodrenders, which do not use it as a controlled mount but rather ready their attacks for when it charges into a target. At that point, they can make an attack against it before it is swallowed. 


### Blood Shrine Tactics

Unlike the skull cannon, blood shrines rush straight at enemies alongside other demons of rage. Have it charge groups of enemies before using Surge of Bloodletting to help other demons reach their foes. Like the skull cannon, the blood shrine should try to swallow enemies that have low Strength and Dexterity.

### Skull Cannon & Blood Shrine Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skull Cannon & Blood Shrine Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Skull Cannon/Blood Shrine Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-8  | 2d6(7) 5gp Items |
|  9-13 | 2d6(7) 10gp Items |

|  21-23 | 2d4(5) 20gp Items |  
|  24+ |  2d6(7) 20gp Items | 

#### Example Skull Cannon & Blood Shrine Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.

## Warthirsters
These greater demons are the mightiest embodiments of war and hatred in existence. They tower over the battlefield, snarling fiendish faces striking terror in the enemy as their mighty wings carry them into melee range. When warthirsters move across land, they devastate the earth itself with their presence, each step rending the ground and leaving a burning trail of hellfire.  Once in striking distance, they cut a swath through their foes with massive demonic blades, slaughtering entire regiments of enemies in a few bloody moments.

Despite their savage appearance, warthirsters are paragons of martial skill able to wield any melee weapon with unparalleled mastery. They can bring a variety of weapons to bear against their enemies. The most common of these weapons are their mighty great axes, capable of felling mighty foes in a single strike, and their burning war whips, which can pull in any craven enemies who attempt to flee the warthirster's fury. 

Spellcasters are usually the first to draw the warthirster's ire, and warthirsters have an innate ability to cut through any magic that would interfere with "honorable" hand-to-hand combat. Most spellcasters find their magic rendered ineffective before becoming a bloodstain smeared across the battlefield.

Warthirsters act as fiendish warlords, often leading demonic armies in search of glory and slaughter. They may serve more powerful demonic entities or act independently, but in either case, they often command lesser demons of rage.  While the chaotic nature of demons usually prevents them from organizing in sophisticated ways, warthirsters possess a brutal authority and instinct for battle tactics, allowing them to direct their murderous hordes to execute sophisticated tactics beyond their typical capabilities.  Once battle is joined, the presence of the warthirster alone is enough to drive all combatants into a frenzy.  Once orderly soldiers quickly succumb to chaotic bloodlust, and all restraint is swept away in the whirlwind of war.

The mightiest of warthirsters who achieve the greatest levels of conquest and bloodshed are sometimes elevated to the status of exalted warthirsters. This is a rare occurrence for the warthirster must prove itself as a paragon of combat and a brutal warlord able to lead warmongering hordes to untold levels of victory and glorious bloodshed. Those who prove worthy become the most powerful demons of rage in existence, leading even greater legions of their bloodthirsty brethren on mighty campaigns of war and slaughter across the cosmos.

### Arsenal of Rage

The warthirster can be equipped with any of the following two weapons:

 ***Greataxe of Fury.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or take 13 (3d8) force damage. If it fails by 10 or more, it takes 27 (6d8) force damage instead. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this force damage dies.

***Skull Mace.*** Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. When the warthirster damages a creature concentrating on a spell, the DC for the saving throw to maintain its concentration is 21 instead of the normal 10 or half the damage received.

 ***Slaughter Blade. (1/turn)*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage. Once per turn, when the warthirster makes this attack, it may then make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature within 10 feet of the original target and within range of the weapon as part of the same action.

***War Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage. The target must make a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet toward the warthirster. If the creature fails the save by 10 or more, it is knocked prone.

### The Bloody Fist
This warthirster has gained legendary notoriety not just for his brutal capabilities but his cruel cunning and unusually high levels of patience. Unlike other demons of rage who recklessly charge headlong into enemies with the intention of slaughtering them all as quickly as possible, The Bloody Fist prefers cunning surgical strikes to cripple foes before wearing them down through prolonged combat. Forces led by The Bloody Fist are likely to cut off an enemy's supply lines, burn any land they could live off of, and then whittle them down through attrition.

To the Bloody Fist, the most frustating aspect of war is when a clear victor emerges, bringing about its conclusion. He hates quick and decisive conflicts, and so when he uses his demonic influence to drive factions and nations into war, he draws them into prolonged, grinding conflicts with no end in sight. The Bloody Fist and his minions will join the fray by attacking  whoever has the upper hand and finding ways to sabatouge their advantage, ensuring no victor emerges as all sides are slowly bled of their resources by a conflict in which there are no winners.

Though The Bloody Fist is patient, he is no less bloodthirsty than the rest of his kin. He simply sates his bloodlust by bleeding his enemies dry rather than slaughtering them all at once. His rage always boils at an intense but controlled simmer, and as such, he's enjoyed many victories where a more reckless warthirster would have charged headlong into defeat.

The Bloody Fist earned his name from the war mace he wields in combat, which resembles a massive brass fist that's perpetually dripping with blood. Beyond this, The Bloody Fist wears a set of spiked brass knuckles and carries a wicked serrated whip. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

All of these weapons are capable of inflicting horrible wounds on their victims who quickly begin bleeding out. As befits his style of warfare, The Bloody Fist uses these weapons to wear down his foes, all while drawing vitality from the blood pouring out of their wounds. The Bloody Fist carries with him many skulls of champions who believed they could goad him into fast and reckless combat, only to find themselves slowly broken and bled dry by this cruel fiend.


### New Condition:  Wounds
While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:

 * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
 * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
 * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

##### Warthirster Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |Villages have descended into a warmongering frenzy, with riots and civil wars breaking out across the land, all heralding the arrival of a warthirster.|
|  2  |On another plane of existence, brutal gladiatorial games are held in which contestants must fend off one demonic horror after another, with the final challenge being a face-off against a warthirster.    |
|  3  |A once proud nation has been reduced to a smoldering warzone, the futureless inhabitants fighting for fighting's sake, as a warthirster rampages from one battle to the next.    |
|  4  | Barbarian tribes and roving demons, including bloodrenders and rage hounds, have begun amassing under the leadership of a warthirster, who may soon command a neigh unstoppable conquering hoard. |
|  5  |A wasteland outpost desperate for help has been cut off from supplies and reinforcements by The Bloody Fist, and its defenses are being whittled away by his forces in preparation for a final attack.|
|  6  | Two nations at war both report seeing warthirsters cutting a swath through major battles. Both nations believe this to be part of a plot by the other side.|

### Warthirster Tactics
Warthirsters excel as melee brutes and possess formidable resistance to magic thanks to their Magic Resistance and Spell Breaker traits. Their ability to fly, coupled with their aggressive nature, allows them to easily reach their desired targets. Although they can fly, warthirsters usually prefer ground combat so that they can make use of their Land Rebels trait.

#### Warthirster Weapons
Warthirsters can choose from four different weapons, each tailored to overcome specific types of opponents:

**Greataxe of Fury:** This weapon is the highest damage-dealing option for warthirsters and is particularly effective against foes with lower Strength.

**Skull Mace:** This weapon is best for dealing with spellcasters.

**Slaughter Blade:** This is the best option for dealing with enemies that tend to group up.

**War Whip:** This is a versatile weapon. It can pull in enemies who attempt to avoid melee combat, position creatures for a Slaughter Blade strike, or pull in a spellcaster for a Skull Mace attack.

\columnbreak

<Br>

#### Warthirster Reactions
Warthirsters have two available reactions:

**Vengeful Strike:** This reaction is generally the preferred choice for warthirsters as it carries less risk.

**Wrathful Counter:** Warthirsters opt for this reaction when they have received disadvantage on attack rolls, are unable to move, or have strong reason to believe an enemy spellcaster is about to cast a 6th-level or higher spell.

#### Exalted Warthirsters
The primary difference with exalted warthirsters is that they possess legendary actions, with their two primary legendary actions used as follows:

**Hellfire Breath:** The exalted warthirster uses this action whenever it can hit three or more opponents at once.

**Head Bash:** This action is used when there aren't enough targets for Hellfire Breath or when there's an opponent causing a significant amount of trouble for the warthirster. A strategic combination is for the warthirster to use Vengeful Strike to close the distance to the desired target and then utilize Head Bash on the same turn.



#### The Bloody Fist
The Bloody Fist's most unique trait is its ability to inflict bloody wounds on its targets, which is complimented by its Goreshell reaction. His main goal is to whittle down foes with wounds while sustaining itself with Goreshell. 

The following tactics can maximize The Bloody Fist's effectiveness:

**Stacking Wounds.** Stack as many wounds on a single target as possible.

**Enemy Healers.** Prioratize taking down anyone capable of casting healing spells at 5th-level or higher.

**Serrated Whip.** This can pull enemies across the blood spikes, causing a massive number of wounds on a target. The Bloody Fist should take any opportunity to use this combo, even if the pulled creature isn't his primary target.

**Switching Targets.** If the Bloody Fist's primary target becomes heavily protected by its allies, who expend significant resources to prevent further wounds, he should switch targets. The Bloody Fist will start inflicting wounds on a new foe, aiming to divert the party's attention.

**Hemorrhaging Roar.** This should be used if he can hit a group of targets who have a total of 9 wounds among them. 

<br>

> ##### Countering Spells
> Remember that a creature countering a spell must commit to doing so before knowing what spell is being cast. As a DM, this is easiest to accomplish by deciding at the start of a player's turn whether you will counter any spell that the player attempts to cast; that way, you can avoid meta-gaming with the warthirster.

### Warthirster Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Warthirster Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## The Exiled One

No warthirster is more feared and infamous than the berserk and unpredictable demon known as The Exiled One. This title is a mark of his great shame among his kind, for long ago, he dared strike as his master. This was a futile attack, for his master was a mighty god of rage and war, and as punishment, the demon was viciously throttled by his master before being violently hurled through the cosmos. The Exiled One fell through existence before impacting The Material Plane with the force of a meteor.

The ordeal has left The Exiled One's wings permanently mangled and broken and his face scared and disfigured. But the damage goes deeper than his immortal body. The Exiled One's mind was shattered by the intensity of his master's fury. Even compared to other warthirsters, The Exiled One is uncontrolled in his rage and bloodlust. He wanders across planes of existence from one bloody massacre to the next, always drawn to places rife with war. 

When possible, The Exiled One gathers armies of other demons of rage or demon-worshipping barbarians and leads them on bloody crusades. 

\columnbreak

Though The Exiled One is seen as an outcast by most demonic forces of rage, his power cannot be denied, and many flock to him for the chance to revel in the bloody havoc he wreaks wherever he goes. While his experiences have driven him half mad, The Exiled One still carries the wartime instincts innate to all warthirsters, and leading his forces into battle is second nature to him.

In battle, The Exiled One's rage-addled mind infects those around, causing their minds to swirl with thoughts of violence and bloodshed. As he fights, his unhinged fury grows, quickly turning him into an unstoppable engine of violence and death. Axes cleave through one foe after another as enemy and ally alike succumb to senseless rage all around him, leaving The Exiled One at the center of a swirling mealstrom of mad slaughter.

Through all this, The Exiled One hopes to someday redeem himself in the eyes of his godly master. But for all the blood he spills and all the skulls he collects, there shall be no redemption for The Exiled One, only an endless quest for one brutal battle after another.

### The Exiled One's Lair
The Exiled One is a wanderer by nature and rarely makes his lair in one location for long. These temporary abodes range from caves to rocky crags, ravaged castles, and blood-soaked battlefields. Wherever he settles, it doesn't take long for the intensity of The Exiled One's presence to twist his new surroundings. 

While in his lair, The Exiled One's challenge rating increases by 5.

#### Lair Actions

When The Exiled One rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or The Exiled One dies, the lair has an Intelligence 8 and can act of its own accord but always acts in The Exiled One's best interest. While active this way, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

**Axe of Wrath.** A brass axe slices through reality at a point within the lair and flies in a straight line in a direction the lair chooses before disappearing after it moves 100 feet or strikes a solid surface. If the axe would strike a creature, that creature must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the axe strikes the target and disappears. Anything struck by the axe takes 45 (10d8) slashing damage.

**Burning Skull Meteor.** The lair chooses a point within itself which lights up with an ominous red glow. On initiative count 20 of the next round, a 10-foot-radius burning skull falls from the sky to the chosen point. The skull passes through any Large or smaller creatures and objects, halting upon contact with a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. Any creature or object that comes into contact with the skull must make a Dexterity saving throw., taking 22 (5d8) fire damage and 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. The area where the skull lands becomes difficult terrain until initiative count 20 of the following round. Creatures ending their turn in this area take 22 (5d8) fire damage.

**Binding Chain.** The lair manifests a chain that emerges from the ground in an unoccupied space on a solid surface of its choice within itself. The chain targets a creature selected by the lair within 100 feet of where it emerged. The targeted creature must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the creature's choice) or be pulled toward the chain and restrained by it for 1 minute. Creatures immune to the grappled condition are unaffected by this effect.

While restrained by the chain, a creature cannot move more than 10 feet away from the chain's origin point and is unable to teleport or travel between planes. The creature can use its action to attempt a DC 19 Strength check, ending the restraint on a success.

The chain has an Armor Class (AC) of 19, 30 hit points, and immunity to fire, psychic, and poison damage. If the chain is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and the creature is no longer restrained.

> ##### Indoor Lairs
> If The Exiled One's lair is inside a structure such as a ruined keep or cave, you can change the Burning Skull Meteor lair action to be a fiery cave-in instead.

### Epic Exiled One Battle
If you wish to make The Exiled One into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 840 hit points. This increases his CR to 28.



### Exiled One Adventure Hooks
The following adventure hooks can provide you with some ways to include The Exiled One in your campaigns.

##### The Exiled One Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Emperor's Skull:** The Exiled One finds a kingdom that worships the remains of their demi-god founder, whose eternal spirit is said to protect the land from supernatural threats. The Exiled One seeks to claim the skull of this so-called "God Emperor" so that he may earn the favor of his former master. |
|  2  | **Fury Unchained:** Long ago, The Exiled One was chained within a rocky tomb in a remote mountain range on The Material Plane. Cultists of rage exiled by their former comrades see The Exiled One as their divine patron and seek to find and unleash him on the world once more. |
|  3  | **Forever War:** Two nations seek a resolution to a seemingly endless war. However, soldiers have become increasingly violent and armies have been charging into battle against orders. All this heralds the coming of The Exiled One, whose arrival would cause an untold escalation in bloodshed and threaten any hope of ending the war. |
|  4  | **Forsaken Redemption:** Frustrated with his inability to regain his master's favor, The Exiled One has made war on his former god and all the god's worshippers, choosing vengeance over redemption. The Exiled One's bloody crusade leads him to tear through cities and villages in search of cultists as he butchers everything in his way. |

### The Exiled One Tactics
The Exiled One uses most of the same tactics as other blood thirsters, and he never backs down from combat. The primary mechanical difference is the levels of fury he gains through a fight from his Fury Incarnate trait. Below are some tips to keep in mind.

* The Exiled One's primary objective is to engage the opponents dealing the most damage to him, as he seeks to prolong the conflict as much as possible to gain more fury.

* Use Bellow of Fury whenever it can strike three or more targets or if he is unable to reach any opponents.

 * Use his reactions the same way you would with a normal Blood Thirster

# Gifts of Rage
This section lists options for customizing creatures with abilities associated with the demonic forces of rage. By using these options, you can incorporate creatures not normally associated with these forces into adventures centering on demons of decay. They may worship gods of war, have been corrupted by demons of slaughter, or have sold their souls for greater martial prowess. In battle, they are much more aggressive than their normal kin, rarely showing any sense of restraint or self-preservation.

## Abilities of Rage

This section lists different abilities you can add to creatures to make them more thematically aligned with the forces of rage. Each ability added to a creature increases its CR by 1. Though this isn’t an exact science, as different abilities will synergize better with some creatures than others, so use your best judgment.

A creature with a demonic ability is considered to be a creature of that ability’s theme, ex a creature with a demonic ability from the rage theme is a Creature of Rage.

Some of these abilities will require a saving throw. Use the CR of the creature with the ability to determine the DC for the save, as shown below:

* CR 4 or lower - DC 13 
* CR 5 to 8 - DC 15
* CR 9 to 12 - DC 17
* CR 13 to 16 - DC 18
* CR 17+ - DC 19

#### Mounting Fury
*As this creature’s rage reaches its peak, it becomes all but unstoppable.*

At the start of each of the gifted creature's turns, if it has attacked a creature or taken damage since its last turn, it gains a cumulative +1 bonus to melee attack rolls, saving throws, and AC for the next minute. This bonus can stack up to 3 times.



> ##### New Condition: Obsessed
> The Osessive Hatred ability uses the Obsessed condition. Obsessed creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Obsessive Hatred
*The creature can choose a single target to focus all its uncontrollable hate towards.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, it can choose one creature it can see within 120 feet of it. The gifted creature becomes obsessed with the chosen creature, causing the gifted creature to go berserk and gain a +3 bonus to melee attack rolls against the obsessed creature.





The gifted creature cannot use this feature if it is already obsessed with a creature. The obsession lasts until the creature it is obsessed with dies or has not been seen by the gifted creature for over 1 minute.

#### Shattering Blows
*The strike of this creature can sunder the defenses of its foes.*

Once per turn, when this creature hits a target with a melee weapon attack, it can reduce the target's AC by 1 for the next minute. This ability can stack up to 5 times on a creature. Attacks from multiple creatures with this ability stack together.

#### Thirst for Battle
*There is nothing that angers this creature more than being denied combat.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, if there is no creature within reach of any of its melee weapon attacks, the gifted creature goes berserk until the end of the turn. While berserk, it gains a +3 bonus to any melee attack rolls it makes, and its movement speed is increased by 30 feet.

#### Too Angry to Die
*Grievous wounds serve only to stoke the creature's resolve.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, if it has half its hit points or fewer, it gains 20 temporary hit points.

#### Unpredictable Temper 
*The creature randomly enters a berserk fury during combat*

At the end of each of the gifted creature's turns, it may roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, it goes berserk until the end of its next turn. While berserk, the gifted creature gets +3 bonus to melee attack rolls and gains an additional action on each of its turns.

Once the creature goes berserk in this way, it cannot do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.

## Lair Actions of Rage

This section lists different lair actions you can give gifted creatures access to when they’re fighting at a location under the demonic influences of rage.

These may be locations racked by blood-soaked battlefields, shrines devoted to demon lords of rage, or countrysides ravaged by brutal raiders. Those aligned with the dark influences of these locations can draw on their power to lay their enemies low.

You can give one or more creatures the ability to access two or more lair actions listed in this section that all belong to the same theme. Only one creature can take a lair action per round. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any creature with lair actions can take one lair action.

When you add lair actions to an encounter, you can treat the lair as an additional creature being added for the purposes of determining how it increases the encounter’s challenge rating. The equivalent CR of the lair depends on the average level of the players, as shown in the table below. If a lair action requires a saving throw, the DC of the save is determined by the equivalent CR of the lair. 

##### Lair Challenge Ratings (CRs)
| Party Level Range  | Lair CR | Lair Save DC |  
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1-4  | 1 | 13 |
|  5-8  | 2 | 15 |
|  9-12 | 3 |  17 |
|  13-16| 4 |   18 |
| 17-20 | 5 |  19 |

### Lair Actions of Rage

Any Creature that can use these lair actions is a Creature <br> of Rage.

#### Axe of Wrath

A brass axe slices through reality at a point within <br> the lair of the gifted creature's choice and flies in a <br> straight line 100 feet in a direction the gifted <br> creature chooses before disappearing, <br> disappearing early if it impacts a solid surface. <br> If the weapon would strike a creature, that <br> creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. <br> On a failed save, the axe strikes the target <br> and stops moving.

* **CR 1:** - 2d8 slashing damage.
* **CR 2:** - 4d8 slashing damage.
* **CR 3:** - 6d8 slashing damage.
* **CR 4:** - 8d8 slashing damage.
* **CR 5:** - 10d8 slashing damage.

\columnbreak

#### Blood-Curdling War Cry

A battle cry rings throughout the lair, and each non-Creature of Rage within the lair must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until initiative count 20 on the next round. While frightened, Creatures of Rage have advantage on melee attack rolls against the creature.

A creature can choose to embrace the battle cry and make the saving throw with advantage. If it succeeds on the saving throw in this way, it goes berserk until initiative count 20 on the next round.

#### Crimson Rain

The gifted creature calls forth a downpour of bloody rain that invigorates each Creature of Rage within a 20-foot-radius, 80-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within the lair. Each affected creature gains temporary hit points based on the lair's CR:

* **CR 1:** 2d4 temporary hit points
* **CR 2:** 4d4 temporary hit points
* **CR 3:** 6d4 temporary hit points
* **CR 4:** 8d4 temporary hit points
* **CR 5:** 10d4 temporary hit points

#### Final Fury

Rage fills the room, giving the devoted a final attack in their death throes. Each creature of the gifted creature’s choice that has died since the last lair action returns to life with 1 hit point. This action can’t return a creature to life that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts, or revive a creature who has already been revived using this feature. A creature revived this way can choose to stand up immediately and is immune to all damage until the end of its next turn, after which it dies again.

#### Hex Bane

A burning hatred of the magical arts fills the lair, boiling the blood of any creature that attempts to cast a spell. Until initiative count 20 of the next round, any creature that tries to cast a spell within the lair feels their blood start to burn. The creature can choose another action, but if its tries to cast the spell, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 fire damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted. 

#### Skull Meteor

The gifted creature chooses a point on the ground within the lair, and a burning skull forms in the sky above. On initiative count 20 of the next round, the skull comes crashing down at the point. Each creature within the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The amount of damage and radius of the area affected depends on the lair's CR:

* **CR 1:** 10-foot radius sphere, dealing 1d8 fire damage and 1d8 bludgeoning damage
* **CR 2:** 10-foot radius sphere, dealing 2d8 fire damage and 2d8 bludgeoning damage

## Customizable Demons

The following demons aren’t specifically aligned with the forces of decay but can be used as a baseline for adding gifts of decay and other customizations to make them a part of your forces of decay. 

### Chaos Fury

These wicked, winged demons personify the unpredictable and volatile nature of chaos. They stand roughly three to four feet tall, with lean, muscular bodies that can take on various appearances depending on the influence of the demons they serve. Their wide, leathery wings grant them impressive speed and agility in flight, while their long, sharp claws allow them to easily slice through vulnerable flesh. 

Chaos furies are believed to be lesser demons, birthed from the raw energies of the realm of chaos. Their malleable and subservient nature means they are often used as agents of chaos by more powerful demons, sowing discord and confusion before a larger demonic incursion. Despite their small size and seemingly low threat level, these creatures' unpredictable and opportunistic nature allows them to wreak havoc on larger enemies. Chaos furies are cowardly by nature and will wait until they see vulnerable or isolated foes before striking at lightning speed, using hit-and-run attacks to prevent their prey from mounting an effective counterattack.

Unlike many other demons, chaos furies have not been intentionally created by any of the chaos gods and do not embody any specific dark impulses beyond simple, chaotic malevolence. As such, they are blank slates easily molded to suit the whims of their more powerful masters and wide varieties of chaos furies exist with a multitude of different demonic gifts and unique powers.

##### Chaos Fury Adventure Hooks

### Demon Prince

Demon princes, known also as the Ascended, the Exalted, and the Chaos-Born, are among the most potent and feared entities in the multiverse. These dread figures tower over most mortal creatures, their forms a terrifying blend of the mortal and the infernal, an unholy testament to their fallen nature. Standing at least twice the height of a man, they are the epitome of strength and power, a monstrous fusion of bone, muscle, and dark magic.

Demon princes were once mortal beings, individuals of such extraordinary ambition and wickedness that they caught the attention of the dark gods of the outer planes. These mortals were elevated to their current status as a reward for their exceptional service, often having led armies, toppled kingdoms, or committed atrocities beyond mortal comprehension.

Their forms vary greatly, reflecting the nature of the dark power they serve, their own inherent characteristics, and the mortal form they once possessed. Some demon princes retain a semblance of humanoid form, albeit grotesquely warped and augmented, while others are monstrous, having multiple limbs, horns, wings, or other more bizarre features.
Demon Princes possess immense physical strength and durability, far surpassing that of most mortal creatures. Many are also gifted with potent magical abilities that reflect their patron's nature and realm, such as tormenting the minds of their foes, spreading decay, or twisting reality. The exact nature and extent of their abilities can vary greatly from one demon prince to another.

The path to ascension into demonhood is fraught with danger and torment. Many who attempt it fall into madness or are consumed by the very powers they sought to master, and most followers of the dark gods simply die violent deaths before achieving the glory needed to earn the favor of their patron. However, those who succeed are granted immortality and power beyond mortal comprehension, becoming the right hand of their dark patron and a prince among demons.

While a demon prince is a terrifying opponent, it is also a cautionary tale, a stark reminder of the terrible price of ambition unbound and the seductive lure of ultimate power.

### Soul Grinder

Demonic soul grinders are monstrous constructs, a terrifying fusion of demon and machine, that exist only to harvest souls for the chaotic deities of the outer planes. These enormous entities tower over the battlefield, their forms a grotesque blend of flesh and blackened iron covered in spines, skulls, and runes of power.

Soul grinders are characterized by their enormous grinding limbs and mechanical weaponry, which they use to obliterate their foes and consume their souls. The upper bodies of these constructs often resemble the demons that inhabit them, with a multitude of eyes, horns, and mouths, while their lower bodies are mechanical, often taking the form of a monstrous, spiked wheel or multiple-legged apparatus.

The creation of a doul grinder is a horrific process that involves binding a powerful demon within the cold iron shell of the construct. This process often drives the demon insane, resulting in a creature of uncontrolled rage and hunger. 
This process also involves equipping the demon with various weapons that are fused into their tortured forms. Each soul grinder comes with a different arsenal of weapons at its disposal, which dictates their preferred forms of combat. Some wield devesting blades and crushing claws, others trample their foes under their mechanical legs, and others bombard their foes from a distance with fiendish artillery.

This fate is said to befall demons who were defeated and unable to fully reform within their demonic plane. Desperate for another chance to wreak havoc, they made a bargain with fiendish smiths who forged them into new bodies. Only by repaying the smiths with a tremendous tally of souls harvested from the Material Plane can the soul grinders be fully restored to their original forms. Those who fail to do so risk becoming trapped in their mechanical forms for eternity. In a cruel form of irony, soul grinders demonstrate that even demons can be damned to a greater form of tortured existence.

## Creatures of Rage
These creatures have been instilled with an insatiable demonic fury, making them all the more deadly in combat. They may worship gods of war, have been corrupted by demons of slaughter, or have sold their souls for greater martial prowess. In battle, they are much more aggressive than their normal kin, rarely showing any sense of restraint or self-preservation.

### Bugbear Warmonger (Bugbear)
These bugbears have forsaken the worship of their traditional gods in favor of a new demon lord of war and carnage who grants them heightened aggression and brutal combat powers. Gone is their laziness and cowardice, for they are concerned only with gathering heads for their lord. Though they still excel at stealth and sneak attacks, once the ambush is executed, these bugbears press their attack no matter the odds until they’ve slaughtered every foe in sight.

### The Bugbear’s Lair

This lair is a shrine devoted to the bugbears’   demonic patron. In typical bugbear fashion, they  decorate it with grizzly trophies, with severed heads being a favorite. The rage that permeates  the shrine is so strong it transcends death. The  heads that decorate the lair can become an  instrument of their patron’s wrath, and his grip on their souls is such that he can call fallen bugbears  into one last act of bloody service before their life is extinguished in his name.

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 2. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any bugbear warmonger can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:




##### Blood-Curdling War Cry

A battle cry rings throughout the lair, and each non-Creature of Rage within the lair must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is frightened until initiative count 20 on the next round. While frightened, Creatures of Rage have advantage on melee attack rolls against the creature.

A creature can choose to embrace the battle cry and make the saving throw with advantage. If it succeeds on the saving throw in this way, it goes berserk until initiative count 20 on the next round.


##### Final Fury

Rage fills the room, giving the devoted a final attack in their death throes. Each creature of the bugbear’s choice that has died since the last lair action returns to life with 1 hit point. This action can’t return a creature to life that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts, or revive a creature who has already been revived using this <br> feature. A creature revived this way can choose to <br> stand up immediately and is immune to all damage <br> until the end of its next turn, after which it <br> dies again.

\columnbreak




##### Skull Meteor

The bugbear chooses a point on the ground within the lair, which begins to glow menacingly. On initiative count 20 of the next round, one of the room’s severed heads catches on fire and lets loose a war cry as it flies into that point and explodes. Each creature within a 10-foot radius sphere of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking damage 4 (1d8) fire damage and 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Frenzied Hydra (Hydra)
This hydra may be the favored pet of a powerful demon lord who has imbued it with an ungodly temper. Alternatively, it may be a hydra who nested too close to a demonic rift and succumbed to its maddening influence.

\columnbreak

<Br><br>

Regardless, the hydra’s alterations have made it wildly unpredictable and bloodthirsty, willing to attack anything it sees with no provocation. Once it identifies prey, its fury only grows as its many heads rabidly tear through flesh and bone.

>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head regrown in this way.
>
> ***Reactive Heads.*** For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can be used only for opportunity attacks.
>
> ***Unpredictable Temper.*** At the end of each of the hydra's turns, it may roll a d6. On a 5 or 6, it goes berserk until the end of its next turn. While rampaging, the hydra gets +3 bonus to melee attack rolls and gains an additional action on each of its turns.<br>

### Rage Zombie (Zombie)
The animating force behind this zombie is an unholy rage for the living. These may be former warriors who died violent deaths in service of bloodthirsty demonic overlords, or they may be corpses possessed by demonic spirits of rage.

Regardless of their origin, these corpses possess a fervor unknown to most other zombies. This makes them especially difficult to destroy as their rage drives them to push past grievous injuries and pursue foes with unholy vigor.
