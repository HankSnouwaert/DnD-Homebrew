# Lizardmen Compendium

The ancient and inscrutable lizardmen dwell within their jungle cities, constructed in ages past and dedicated to a now crumbling world order. What remains of this civilization serves as a reminder of the primordial powers that once shaped the land, and the lizardmen make full use of the ancient power they still have at their disposal. This power ranges from ancient relics left over from their golden age to mighty dinosaurs used as beasts of burden and living weapons.

The lizardmen themselves come in several subspecies, each with a dedicated role to serve within the larger empire. All of these lizardmen regard outsiders with suspicion, if not outright hostility, and some will even form conquering armies determined to restore the old order. The players are most likely to encounter the lizardmen when exploring their jungle homes. The players may be attempting to traverse jungles, explore ruins, or acquire relics within the realm of the lizardmen, which will naturally lead to confrontations.



\columnbreak

 Alternatively, the lizardmen may be marching from their realm to impose their unfathomable will upon the world, which could lead to the players having to fend off their reptilian invasion.

This document provides content to help you run games that heavily feature the lizardmen or any of the primeval creatures that dwell in their realm. This content ranges from new spells used by the lizardmen, to rules for implementing the types of combat equipment they use, to a bestiary of the different types of lizardmen and the monsters they utilize. Whether the players only have a minor side quest featuring lizardmen or an entire campaign, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

# Running Lizardmen Adventures
The setting you're running your adventures in will help determine the background of these lizardmen and their lore. They may be the primordial cousins of the lizardfolk in other settings, or they may be the stewards of an ancient empire. They may be noble protectors against ancient, long-forgotten evils or heartless conquers that eliminate other species without remorse.

Regardless of the specifics, there are some commonalities that tie lizardmen together, each of which could lead to conflict with the players:
* **Ancient:** Lizardmen are a primordial race, and their civilization is older than that of most mortals. This leads to them living in ancient cities and possessing powerful and valuable relics, which could put them at odds with treasure-hunting players.
* **Instructable:** Lizardmen possess a cold-blooded psychology that seems alien to most other races. They rarely display recognizable emotions and carry out their actions in a way that often seems callous to others. This behavior can often lead to conflicts with other races that the players could be pulled into.
* **Primal:** Despite lacking humanoid emotions, lizardmen are closely tied to their bestial natures and prone to bouts of primal aggression. This primal nature allows them to easily bond with other reptilian creatures, such as dinosaurs, which they often use in battle. Should the players wander into their territory, they may quickly find themselves on the receiving end of lizardmen’s primal aggression. 

\columnbreak



* **Devoted:** Despite their primal natures, lizardmen are prone to following orders from more powerful beings. They make for loyal and surprisingly orderly soldiers and will fight to the death for their cause. Should the players interfere with the plans of their masters, the lizardmen will show them no mercy.

### Lizardmen Motivations
The long-term motivations of the lizardmen almost always involve executing the great plan they believe their gods left for them to safeguard. This plan is meant to keep the world in order and guard against chaos. All other short-term goals are meant only to serve this greater plan. The only exceptions to this are when some of the lizardmen succumb to their more primeval natures and begin operating on base instinct. 

When role-playing lizardmen it’s usually best to keep their motivations both simple and difficult to read. When defending their territory or attacking those in possession of their relics, their motivations are as straightforward as a territorial animal’s. But when executing grand campaigns, they believe with further the great plan of their gods, their motivations may be indecipherable to outsiders. 

#### Common Lizardmen Motivations
* Destroy Intruders
* Protect or Reclaim Sacred Sites Artifacts
* Exterminate Members of Other Races Working Against the Great Plan (Whether They Know They Are Or Not)
* Collect Sacrifices for Their Ancient Gods
* Eliminate Otherworldly Forces of Chaos Entering the World
* Acquire Jungle Beasts for Labor and Wartime Use

## Lizardmen Tactics
Lizardmen are highly resilient and resourceful combatants who combine primal aggression with instinctive tactical acumen. While each subspecies and the various dinosaurs they make use of all fight differently, there are some general commonalities:

***Melee Oriented.*** Lizardmen usually have better melee options than ranged options. Skinks are exceptions to this, but for most other lizardmen and their dinosaurs, it’s usually best to close into melee range with the players as quickly as possible.

***Mixed Forces.*** Lizardmen forces generally benefit from mixing nimble skinks in with mightier saurian and dinosaurs. The skinks can debilitate foes while their kin move in for the kill.

***Rampaging.*** Most lizardmen, other than skinks, will begin rampaging when they drop to a third of their HP or less and other some other special circumstances. This condition forces them to engage their closest enemies in melee combat and can be used against them by cunning players. However, some lizardmen abilities boost their combat potential while they’re rampaging, so some lizardmen may intentionally drive themselves into a rampage.

#### Engagement
How the lizardmen engage in combat will largely depend on whether they have skinks among their forces. Skinks are master ambushers and will usually try to catch players by surprise and put them on the back foot before directing their harder-hitting allies to close in.

\columnbreak

Lizardmen operating without skinks tend to be less stealthy and forgo the element of surprise to try to close in on the players as quickly as possible. That’s not to say they lack tactical nuance. Saurian warriors will still try to attack from optimal angles, surround foes, and pick off prime targets whenever possible.

#### Combat
In combat, lizardmen combine cold-blooded, brutal efficiency with primal ferocity. They execute orders they are given to a tee and are hyperfocused on their mission to the exclusion of almost all else. However, the targets of their wrath are subjected to animalistic brutality. When playing them, keep them focused on their objective and allow them to execute complex plans and make intelligent tactical decisions, but make sure any players they’re attacking feel like they’re being brutalized by an unrelenting beast.

#### Retreat
Lizardmen are utterly devoted to their cause, and most will fight to the death if it is in service to the great plan of their gods. This is not to say they are utterly unflappable. Skinks are skittish and may give in to their fear if the odds seem stacked heavily against them, causing them to scamper away from threats. Most other lizardmen struggle with the opposite instinct. When things start looking dire, they will enter a bloody rampage that leads to them fighting to the death, regardless of whether it's in the best interest of the lizardman force as a whole. 
Should the players retreat, most lizardmen will give chase if they have the strength to do so. They are remorseless and unforgiving by nature, and once they’ve marked prey for death, they rarely abandon their mission.

# New Spells

## Lore of Beasts
This brand of magic draws on the power of the wilds and the animals that inhabit them. Those who practice it avoid civilization and live hermitic lives in the savage and untamed wilderness. Their magic harnesses the power of the beasts they dwell alongside, often by summoning wild spirits or unleashing the inner savagery of themselves and others to transform them into primeval creatures. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Beasts often wield.

#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

<br>

#### Aspect of the Beast

*4th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

#### Bestial Spirit

*4th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> The following spell references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

#### Call of the Pack

*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Ranger
___

Unleashing a primal howl, you stir the wild fervor within your allies. You and up to three other creatures you are aware of within range that can hear you are quickened until the start of your next turn. While quickened this way, these creatures gain advantage on attack rolls against any enemy if at least one of their allies is within 5 feet of that enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### Impenetrable Pelt

*5th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1  action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a tuft of fur)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

On a failed save, it becomes charmed and frightened by you until the end of your next turn. Regardless of the save's outcome, you gain a +5 bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) and Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with that creature until the spell concludes.

Regardless of the outcome, the directed crow is expended. The spell ends if all crows are expended. For each crow circling above you, you gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.

## Lore of Heavens
This brand of magic draws its power from the sky and the movements of celestial bodies. Those who study this lore often spend long periods of time observing the patterns and motions of the cosmos and are well known for their ability to discern events that have yet to pass through these observations. Spells from this lore also call upon the power of the skies, unleashing bolts of lightning, torrents of hail, or savage gusts of wind. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Heavens often wield.

#### Comet's Call
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A piece of iron or nickel ore)
- **Duration:**   1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Wizard, Sorcerer
___

You channel the winds of magic to summon a comet from the heavens to the battlefield. You select a point you can see, 300 feet above you within range, causing a blue pulse to flash in the sky. 

At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, nothing occurs. On a roll of 4-6, a 5-foot-radius comet materializes at the chosen point and immediately descends. The comet passes through any Large or smaller creatures and objects, exploding in a 30-foot-radius sphere when it hits a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. The explosion's effects spread around corners. 

Each creature or object the comet comes in contact with, as well as those within the explosion's area, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the comet's full damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success. The comet's base damage is 5d8 fire damage plus 5d8 bludgeoning damage. Each time you roll to see if the comet appears and it doesn't, the fire and bludgeoning damage it deals each increase by 1d8. The spell ends after the comet lands.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (Pinch of salt)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

You summon a chilling wind, affecting an area within range that can be up to 40 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall. Up to six creatures of your choice within this area feel their fortune wane. Each targeted creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be cursed by this spell for its duration.

While cursed:
* If the creature rolls an 18 or higher on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not caused by this spell, it automatically fails.
* When another creature makes an attack against the cursed target and rolls a 3 or lower on the attack roll, the attacking creature automatically hits.

At the end of its turn, an affected creature can attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending the curse's effect on it on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Harmonic Convergence

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V S M (A piece of string)
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:**   Bard, Cleric, Druid
___

Divining auspicious omens, you grant a creature you <Br> can see within range a brief insight into the immediate <Br> future. Until the start of your next turn, if the chosen <Br> creature misses with an attack roll or fails a Dexterity <Br> saving throw, it can end the spell early to reroll the d20 <Br> and must use the new result. Similarly, when an attack <Br> roll is made against the chosen creature, it can end the <Br> spell early to force the attacker to reroll the d20, and the attacker must use the new result.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.

#### Ice Storm (Revised)
*4th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few <br> drops of water)
- **Duration:**  1 Round
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A barrage of rock-hard ice plummets from the sky, forming a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. The area becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn, and any  creature within it has disadvantage on ranged attack rolls.

When the ice storm initially appears or if a creature is inside its area at the end of your next turn, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, both the bludgeoning and cold damage increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.


#### Lighting Strike
*2nd-level evocation*

- **Duration:**  Instantaneous

___

You summon a bolt of lightning to strike a point you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can summon an additional lightning bolt for each slot level above 2nd. These bolts can target the same or different points. If a creature is in the area of more than one lightning bolt, it is affected only once.

#### Second Sight 
*2nd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

Guided by an astral prophecy, your sight extends beyond the present moment. Until the spell ends, when you or a creature within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll or a saving throw, you can end the spell prematurely, allowing the creature to roll an additional d20. This decision can be made after the original roll but before the outcome is determined. The creature then chooses which of the d20s to use for the attack roll or saving throw.

Alternatively, if an attack is made against you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you, you can end the spell to roll a d20 and then decide whether the attack uses the attacker's roll or yours.

If multiple effects, such as another instance of this spell or a feature like the Lucky feat, attempt to modify a single roll, they negate each other, resulting in no additional dice being rolled.

#### Wind Blast
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A legume seed)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You summon a powerful gust of wind emanating from a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range and blasting out in the direction of your choice. Medium or smaller objects in this area that aren't secured and aren't being worn or carried are pushed up to 15 feet in the chosen direction. Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed in the chosen direction and knocked prone. The wind also disperses gas and vapor and extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in its area.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the wind pushes creatures and objects an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger

The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller.

The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save.

On a successful save, the target takes half damage, and the spell ends immediately.

While the target remains under the spell's effect, any other creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the laughing target and can hear it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of the laughing creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the start of each of your turns, the target repeats the Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it takes 3d10 Force damage again. On a success, the spell ends.

If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by this spell’s damage, it stabilizes but continues laughing, and can no longer attempt saving throws to end the spell. If the spell ends while the target has 0 hit points, it dies.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot*** The initial and recurring Force damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

> The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

# Magic Items
The following are new lizardmen-themed magic items you can add to your adventures. They are both used by The Last Defender, and if players defeat him, you could give them the opportunity to loot these items for themselves. Otherwise, they could be treasures the players uncover while exploring ancient Lizardmen ruins and forgotten battlefields.


#### Spear of Dread Visions
*Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement), 4,000gp*

This spear was said to have been wielded by the Old Ones themselves. Those struck by it are inflicted with visions of doom that sap them of their will to carry on. The spear grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

**Returning Throw:** If the spear is thrown, it immediately flies back to your hand after the attack.

**Visionary Assault:** Once during your turn, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can inflict upon it a mystical vision. At the end of each of the affected creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) psychic damage for each vision it has been inflicted with.

A creature can have multiple visions simultaneously, and if it is suffering from three or more visions, it is blinded and has disadvantage on Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom saving throws and checks until the visions are removed.


Visions can be removed by the *remove curse* spell or any effect that can remove the blinded condition. A creature with visions or another creature within 5 feet can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check as an action, ending all visions on a success.

A creature with Truesight cannot gain these <Br> visions, and all visions are removed if a creature <Br> gains Truesight. 

\columnbreak

#### Hand of Gods
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement), 5,000gp*

This divine relic appears to be a golden gauntlet with an extended arm piece. While wearing it, its user can create blazing balls of sunlight in the gauntlet's palm, which can then be blasted at enemies.

To attune to this item, you must affix it to your arm, either at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder. Upon doing so, the prosthetic magically transforms, replicating the appearance and function of the limb it's replacing. Once attached, it becomes an integral part of your body.

**Radiant Assault:** Once per turn, when you would normally make an unarmed strike, you can instead opt to make a ranged spell attack with a range of 100ft. using this item. For this attack, add your Wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the target suffers 4d10 radiant damage.

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

\columnbreak

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

# Howdahs
War howdahs are small armored structured mounted to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use different types of howdahs in your games. They can be applied to howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own howdahs. 

## Howdah Rules
Howdahs are generally structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger war beast of some kind. The creatures within the howdah are referred to as riders, and the creature the howdah is mounted upon is referred to as its steed. If one of the riders is controlling the steed, that creature is the pilot. Howdah riders and steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a howdah or its steed, the howdah and its steed are moved together.

* **Controlled & Independant Steeds.** The howdah's steed can be a controlled or independent mount as described in the player's handbook. If it is controlled, there must be a pilot who is controlling it.



\columnbreak

* **Entering & Exiting Howdahs.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah. Any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. Each passenger already inside the howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.



### Howdah Saving Throws
While objects normally automatically fail all Strength, Dexterity, and Constituion saving throws, howdahs are active parts of combat, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, you can use the following rules when howdahs are subject to such saving throws.



<img src='https://i.ibb.co/GtD871x/Linebreaker-Baloth-Dominaria-United-Mt-G-Art-1024x752.jpg' style='position:absolute; bottom:-110px; right:-80px; width:930px; transform:scaleX(1)' />

  style='position:absolute;left:-290px;bottom:140px;transform:rotate(0deg)' />

\pagebreakNum

#### Strength & Dexterity Saves
Howdahs equipped on an unencumbered steed do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as they can rely on their steed to make the save for them. If a howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, its steed must make the saving throw against the effect. If the steed succeeds on the save, the howdah passes the save.

#### Constitution Saves
Howdahs can make their own Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is mounted on a steed.

### Opportunity Attacks
When the howdah steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the howdah itself. Passengers cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures outside the howdah.

### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures inside a howdah are considered to be within 5 feet of each other.

### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of three of the steed's largest hit dice.

### Teleporting
If the steed is teleported, the howdah and its riders can choose to teleport with it.

### Falling Howdahs
When a howdah's steed falls from a height of 10 feet or more, it and all its riders take fall damage as usual, and the riders fall prone.

### Repairing Howdahs
If a howdah has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting repairs, provided it has the necessary tools and parts. After 1 hour of work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus if proficient with the required tools. On success, the howdah regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. On failure, the howdah doesn't regain any hit points, but repairs can be reattempted with the same tools and parts.

### Howdah Destruction
When a howdah is destroyed, riders that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of its steed.

\columnbreak


## Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, howdahs have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Howdah DC 
Whenever the howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, that creature uses this value for the DC.

### Damage Threshold
Most howdahs possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the howdah takes the damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the howdah's hit points.

###  Steed Size
This is the minimum size a creature must be to be the howdah's steed. If a creature ever becomes too small to carry the howdah, the howdah falls off the creature and is knocked over as though its steed was knocked prone, described in the Prone Howdahs section.

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride in the howdah comfortably. Additional creatures may be able to fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the howdah at the DM's discretion.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the howdah adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning howdah, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the howdah is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits the howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

### Siege Weapons
A howdah may have one or more built-in siege weapons. These siege weapons are built into the howdah and share its Hit Points, AC, and Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the howdah is destroyed. These siege weapons can only be operated by riders in the howdah, and riders can't provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the howdah while operating these weapons. The weapons can't be used if the howdah is not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.

## Lizardmen Howdahs

When lizardmen deploy their most titanic reptilian jungle monsters in combat, they are sometimes equipped with mighty war howdahs crewed by smaller lizardmen such as skinks. These howahs are wooden structures that allow an entire lizardman crew to ride atop a mighty steed. The structure provides cover for the crew and can be equppied with siege weapons and even an arcane Engine of the Gods which provides the lizardmen with magical aid. Most lizardmen monsters are far too wild to allow such structures on their back, so those that can be equipped this way are prized by the lizardmen.

### Lizardmen Howdah Upgrades

Large howdahs and huge howdahs can be given any of the following upgrades. Each upgrade increases the howdahs effective CR by 1 unless its states otherwise.


#### Sacred Howdah
*The howdah is not only an instrument of war but a small shrine complete with relics and offerings dedicated to the Old Ones to curry their favor.*

The howdah counts as a magic object, and the three-quarters cover granted by the howdah gives a +5 bonus to all saving throws from effects outside the howdah, not just Dexterity saves. If a creature in the howdah is subjected to an effect from outside that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half damage if it fails.

#### Poison Ballista 

*The howdah is equipped with a ballista whose bolts are tipped with deadly jungle toxins.*

The howdah is equipped with the poison ballista siege weapon.
___

> ***Load.*** The weapon is loaded with a Poison Bolt. This must be done before it is prepped.
>
> ***Prep.*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done while it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The ballista fires a bolt that flies in a straight line up to 480 feet in the direction of the user's choice before falling to the ground. If the bolt would strike a target, that target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if the bolt has flown 120 feet or more. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or destroyed, the bolt keeps flying and deals 11 (2d10) less damage if it hits another target. Otherwise, the bolt's flight ends at the target's location. 

\columnbreak

#### Giant Blowpipe  
*The howdah is equipped with a giant blowpipe capable of firing a hail of poison-tipped darts.*

The howdah is equipped with the giant blowpipe siege weapon.
___
> ## Giant Blowpipe 
> *Medium siege weapon*
>___
> - **Weapon DC** 15
> - **Armor Class** 15 
> - **Hit Points** 60 (damage threshold: 5)
>___
> - **Damage Immunities** poison, psychic
> - **Ammo** Poison Dart Cluster (1 round, 100g)
> - **Challenge** 1 (200 XP)
> ___

> ### Functions
>
> ***Load.*** The weapon is loaded with a Poison Dart Cluster. This must be done before it is prepped.
>
> ***Prep.*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done while it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The blowpipe fires a barrage of darts that rain down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (5d4) piercing damage, is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, and makes the saving throw at the end of its turn against the toxins with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage, is still inflicted with Jungle Toxins, but does not have disadvantage on the saving throw at the end of its turn against the toxins.

<br>

> ##### Jungle Toxins
> At the end of the turn, each creature hit by one or more weapons that inflict Jungle Toxins must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that has been hit by two or more attacks from weapons with Jungle Toxins this turn makes the saving throw with disadvantage. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success or taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failure.

\pagebreakNum

#### Engine of the Gods 
*The howdah is equipped with a sacred relic of the Old Ones capable of unleashing a variety of magical effects by those familiar with its usage.*

A howdah is equipped with an Engine of the Gods, which causes the howdah to be treated as a magical object. The engine has 3 charges by default and can possess up to 3 of the abilities listed below. Riders with the howdah who have proficiency in Religion and a Wisdom and Intelligence of 14 or higher can use their action to expend 1 charge to activate one of the engine's abilities. The engine regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

The Engine of the Gods increases the CR of the Howdah by 4 rather than 1.

##### Burning Alignment 
*As the engine comes into alignment, magical power is unleashed to scour the enemy.*

A vertical column of divine fire, 10 feet in radius and 100 feet high, descends at a point within 300 feet of the howdah of the user's choice. It then moves 30 feet horizontally in a straight line in the direction of the user's choice before dissipating. Each target the column passes through must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful save.  

##### Portent of Warding
*Mysterious power pours from the engine, protecting nearby allies.*

When activating this ability, the rider chooses any number of creatures, and an aura of eldritch warding radiates from the howdah in a 30-foot radius for one minute. Each chosen creature gains resistance to damage from spells while within the aura.

\columnbreak

##### Arcane Configuration
*The engine siphons the winds of magic to aid in casting spells of specific energy.*

When activating this ability, the rider chooses a damage type and any number of creatures within 30 feet. The rider and all the chosen creatures then become empowered until the start of the rider's next turn. The next time an empowered creature casts a spell dealing the chosen damage type, it rolls three additional damage dice. The rider activating this ability can also cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action on the same turn.

##### Time Slows
*The engine bends the flow of time.*

Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 300 feet of the howdah must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be affected by the *slow* spell until the howdah is destroyed. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If it fails the repeat saving throw by 5 or more (DC 12), it is stunned until the effect ends.



##### Healing Light
*The engine releases a burst of light that heals battle-weary allies.*

When activating this ability, the rider chooses any number of creatures within 30 feet. Each chosen creature regains 18 (4d8) hit points.

##### Sacred Summon
*The engine calls to the heavens to summon a champion.*

A sacred saurian appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the howdah of the rider's choice and remains until it or the howdah is reduced to 0 hit points or 10 minutes have passed. The saurian shares the initiative count of the rider who used the ability, and it takes its turn immediately after. The saurian is an ally to the rider and its companions.

# Lizardmen Forces

This section lists the different types of lizardmen along with the primeval creatures they often utilize in battle. The different species of lizardmen include the crox, the saurian, and the skinks. The various reptilian monsters they utilize can be found living alongside the lizardmen or wandering the wilds of their jungle homeland. 

### Blessings of the Old Ones

Some lizardmen are born with enhanced abilities attributed to their ancient gods. The same can even be true for the reptilian creatures they use in battle. These creatures bear colorations that signify their specialized abilities and the unique ways they can serve their masters. You can apply one of these blessings to any of the creature stat blocks described in this document, so long as it has a bite attack and the Primal Instinct trait. Doing so increases its CR by 1. 

Note that some blessings may not make sense for some creatures, such as applying the Blessing of the Beast God to a dinosaur-like creature.

#### Blessing of the Beast God

*These lizardmen are marked with elaborate crests containing striking colors and possess an instinctive kinship with other beasts who possess the same primal instincts.*

If the creature has a controlled mount with the Primal Instinct ability, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the creature’s turns.

Additionally, while the creature or the creature it is mounted on is rampaging, attacks of the creature and the mount deal an additional 9 (2d8) damage on hit.

Finally, if the creature is rampaging, it may choose not to move on its turn if it is mounted, even if this would prevent it from being able to attack.

#### Blessing of the Blood God

*These hyper-aggressive lizardmen are marked with blood-red scales and infused with a ferocity that drives them to slaughter in their god’s name.*

While the creature is rampaging, its has advantage on attack rolls and deals additional 11 (2d10) damage on hit.

#### Blessing of the God of Fate

*These lizardmen are marked by the oldest of gods with pure white scales and are said to be destined for greatness as fate itself bends to their will.*

At the start of creature’s turns, it can choose to be under the effects of the *foresight* spell until the end of its next turn.

Once the creature uses this feature, it can't use it again until it finishes a long rest.

> ##### The Rampaging Condition
> Many creatures in this document have abilities that cause them to enter a rampage. Rampages last for one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: <br>
> &#8226;  Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.<br>
> &#8226; The creature must take the Attack action on each of its turns, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see unless there are no creatures it can reach with an attack. <br>
> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>
> &#8226;  The creature can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

## Carnosaurs

In the dense jungles and vast plains where the Lizardmen thrive, few creatures strike as much awe and terror as the mighty Carnosaurs. These apex predators, with their fearsome presence and unmatched power, are both revered and feared, serving as powerful mounts for the most powerful lizardmen generals.

Carnosaurs are colossal reptilian beasts, standing several times taller than even the largest Lizardmen. Their muscular bodies, covered in thick, rugged scales, bear powerful limbs and a tail that acts both as a counterbalance and a weapon. Their maws are lined with razor-sharp teeth, capable of tearing apart even the toughest of foes. Among the various subspecies, some Carnosaurs sport varying amounts of feathers, adding a unique blend of ferocity and beauty to their appearance.

A Carnosaur on the battlefield is a sight of raw, primal power. These beasts are known for their bloody rampages, cutting through enemy lines with devastating ease. Their jaws and talons deliver grievous wounds, which, more often than not, result in the victim bleeding out over time. The scent of this spilled blood only intensifies the Carnosaur's bloodlust. 



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They often enter feeding frenzies upon tasting it, making them all the more aggressive and insatiable when zeroing in on their bleeding prey.

Such is the might of the Carnosaurs that only the most influential Lizardmen commanders dare mount them for battle. Riding a Carnosaur is not about complete control but rather channeling its natural ferocity. Lizardmen riders, with their limited influence over these beasts, direct them towards the most optimal targets, letting the Carnosaur's instincts do the rest. 

It's a balance of guidance and unleashing raw power, a testament to the Lizardmen's symbiotic relationship with their environment.
Conclusion: Carnosaurs embody the raw essence of nature — unpredictable, unstoppable, and awe-inspiring. For the Lizardmen, these creatures are not just tools of war but symbols of primal might and their civilization's enduring bond with the ancient forces of the world. In every thunderous step and every devastating charge, Carnosaurs remind all of the primal force that the Lizardmen command.

### Guldbloom's Terror 

There is one carnosaur of particular infamy known as Guldbloom's Terror. Named after the ill-fated explorer Jeffory Guldbloom, this creature is more than just a testament to the land's primal dangers. It's a living nightmare that has become the stuff of legends, told in hushed tones around campfires.

Jeffory Guldbloom, a renowned explorer and naturalist, arrived in the Lizardmen homeland with the noble intention of studying its diverse dinosaur fauna. However, during his expedition, his team came across a carnosaur unlike any they'd seen – an apex predator with unparalleled intelligence and power. Rather than being the observer, Guldbloom quickly found himself and his team the observed. One by one, members of his expedition vanished, leaving only signs of a fierce struggle. The group soon realized they were being hunted by this very carnosaur, leading to its grim title, Guldbloom's Terror.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Unlike its kin, Guldbloom's Terror does not rely on sheer force but utilizes stealth and cunning, and its eyes burn with an uncanny intelligence. The creature's hunting technique sets it apart. Abandoning the carnosaur's usual straightforward assault, this beast specializes in ambush attacks. Its scaled hide allows it to blend seamlessly into the dense jungle, setting up perfect ambush points for its prey. What truly terrifies explorers and warriors alike is its methodical approach. Once it marks a target, Guldbloom's Terror hunts with chilling precision, using its environment to stalk, corner, and eventually strike with deadly efficiency.

Guldbloom's final notes, found abandoned near a destroyed campsite, spoke of the creature with a mix of fear and admiration. He wrote of its almost human-like ability to think, strategize, and execute plans. These notes serve as a grim reminder of the expedition's fate and a warning to all who dare tread in Guldbloom's Terror's territory.

### Carnosaur Tactics


Carnosaurs are apex predators, unafraid of any other creature. At the slightest hint of movement, they charge, using their claws to wound their target, followed by a powerful biting attack that sends them into a rampage. They use their tail attack to hit a secondary threat, but always prioritize hitting their primary prey with claw and bite attacks.

Despite their straightforward rampaging tendencies, carnosaurs have some tactical options. Their Blood Tracking ability allows them to pursue the most wounded prey in the area, bypassing the limitations of their rampaging condition. This is especially useful if the wounded target tries to flee. However, outside of this tactic, they still adhere to the standard rampage rules.

The carnosaur's innate lust for blood drives it to attack the most injured target with claw and bite attacks. If that creature manages to heal its wounds, the carnosaur promptly shifts its attention to the next nearest prey.

When lizardmen use carnosaurs as mounts, they shouldn't be treated as fully under the control of their rider unless that rider possesses the 'Blessing of the Beast God' from the lizardmen Blessings of the Old Ones list. A rider without this blessing is limited to guiding the carnosaur toward the most prominent target on the battlefield to unleash its wounding attacks. However, once the carnosaur begins to rampage, the rider loses all control, and the creature behaves as if it were wild.


#### Guldbloom's Terror 

Guldbloom's Terror exhibits unparalleled cunning compared to other carnosaurs. With its ambush ability and the Jungle Stalker trait, it patiently waits for the perfect moment to strike an unsuspecting target, often choosing the largest prey. Despite its sly nature, this creature is fearless and prioritizes kills that offer the most sustenance.
Guldbloom's Terror employs the same tactics as a standard carnosaur but doesn't risk entering into a rampage. It focuses on the most injured target it can detect, tearing it apart with cold precision rather than reckless rampaging.

This carnosaur also possesses legendary actions used in specific situations:

**Blood Tracking and Tenacious Will:** These are employed whenever something prevents the carnosaur from attacking a severely wounded target.

**Claw:** The carnosaur uses this attack when it's adjacent to the most injured prey or if it aims to start wounding a new creature.

**Bloody Roar:** This ability is used when the carnosaur can affect four or more targets with it or if it can impact at least two targets that are either concentrating on spells or flying beyond its reach. Possessing a natural instinct for magic detection, if Guldbloom's Terror senses a spell of seventh level or higher being concentrated upon, it will seek to disrupt it this way.

### Carnosaur Loot
The valuable items looted from carnosaur will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a carnosaur. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Carnosaur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Ceradons
Ceradons are imposing primeval beasts that roam the dense jungles inhabited by the lizardmen. These massive creatures have played a vital role in the history of the lizardmen, serving as powerful weapons of war. Their sheer size and strength make them formidable opponents on the battlefield, and their natural aggression makes them a fearsome sight to behold.

Ceradons are massive quadrupeds, covered in thick, leathery hide. They sport enormous bony plates along their backs, which provide natural armor and are often adorned with warpaint or other dedications to the lizardmen gods. Their most distinctive features are their large, downward-curving horns, capable of impaling and lifting even the largest foes. 

Ceradons are omnivores and opportunistic feeders, feasting on vegetation and small prey alike. However, they are also territorial and highly aggressive. They seldom retreat, often choosing to stand their ground and face foes head-on. Their primary mode of attack is charging, using their massive bulk to trample enemies or impale them with their horns. Their armored crests can deflect incoming attacks, making them challenging to land a counterattack against.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The lizardmen have long utilized ceradons in warfare. Skink crews equip these massive creatures with war howdahs, turning them into mobile fortresses. These howdahs often come equipped with giant blowpipes and ballistae that fire poisoned-tipped bolts, allowing the skinks to rain death upon their enemies from a relatively safe position. Occasionally, a howdah may be equipped with an engine of the gods, an ancient relic with arcane properties that skinks can channel to unleash devastating effects on the battlefield.

As ceradons age, they grow even larger and more powerful. The ancient ceradons are the most revered among their kind, their once fiery temper cooling with age. This makes them easier for skink crews to handle, and they are less prone to rampaging uncontrollably. Ancient ceradons are often equipped with the most elite and powerful howdahs, reserved for only the most critical battles.

### The Thunderous One

This legendary ancient ceradon is said to be an avatar of the lizardmen storm god. It is a sacred beast, taller and more formidable than even its other ancient kin, and its presence is said to be an omen of great battles to come. Its scales are the color of a stormy sky, and its eyes crackle with the energy of a tempest. Unlike other ancient ceradons, the Thunderous One's temper has not cooled with age; instead, it rages like a storm, manifesting in thunderous effects that send shockwaves through enemy ranks.

In battle, the Thunderous One's steps echo with the sound of thunder, and its roars flash with claps of lightning. Those who incur its wrath not only face its primeval natural weapons but the divine lightning of its god. Bolts of this lightning rain down on the Thunderous One's foes and electrify those it tramples underfoot. 

\columnbreak

And should it enter a rampage, the Thunderous One's primal roar is said to be powerful to shatter armies and scatter dozens of foes before it. 

The howdahs mounted on the Thunderous One are the most powerful and sacred among the lizardmen, often adorned with religious icons and potent relics. They carry elite skink crews, who wield powerful weapons blessed by the lizardmen priests. These skinks, though humbled by their proximity to such a mighty beast, are the only ones with the experience and knowledge to guide the Thunderous One in battle.

In the heat of war, the Thunderous One becomes a force of nature, bringing the wrath of the storm god upon the enemies of the lizardmen. Its mere presence on the battlefield is a testament to the power of the lizardmen's gods and a sign that the storm god's will is manifesting through the actions of the lizardmen and their mighty ally, the Thunderous One.

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Raging Fire, Raging Beasts:** A dormant volcano in the lizardmen homeland suddenly erupts, sending molten lava and ash into the air. As though the eruption is not deadly enough, it also causes a nearby herd of ceradons to go on a wild stampede, threatening nearby settlements. The adventurers are called upon to protect these villages, divert the ceradon herd away from inhabited areas, and rescue any stranded villagers from the volcanic disaster. |
|  2  |**The Sunken Temple:** An ancient underwater temple has surfaced, rumored to be home to a legendary treasure. However, a fearsome ceradon guards the entrance, adorned with a howdah filled with elite skink warriors. The adventurers must carefully navigate the temple's traps and confront the ceradon and its crew to claim the treasure.|
|  3 | **Gift of the Gods:** A lizardmen tribe believes that the adventurers have been chosen by their gods to fulfill an ancient prophecy. They offer a tamed ceradon as a gift, complete with a howdah and skink crew. The adventurers must use their new allies to defend the lizardmen settlement from an impending demonic invasion.|

### Ceradon Tactics

Ceradons are territorial, highly aggressive, and omnivorous creatures. While they don't actively hunt prey, they will readily attack anything within charging distance. In battle, a ceradon is resolute and acts primarily on instinct. It focuses on adversaries it perceives as the greatest threat, often choosing targets dealing significant damage or those of considerable size. However, it lacks the intelligence to realize the potential benefits of trampling multiple targets for increased damage output.

If a ceradon starts an encounter already in melee combat, it will retreat, even if doing so exposes itself to opportunity attacks. To defend against such attacks, it employs its Armoured Crest reaction. Following the retreat, it starts charging foes with its Trample action. The ceradon will follow this up with its Gore attack. While it can't gore a target right beneath it, it can trample over a target before circling back to Gore, often doing so with an advantage. Once an opponent is impaled on its horns, the ceradon shifts focus to trampling nearby threats. If it pins another creature under its feet, it will continue its stomp attacks while standing atop the pinned foe.

#### Ceradons With Howdahs

Ceradons equipped with a howdah can display tactical battle acumen under their rider's guidance. They frequently trample through dense clusters of enemies. Even if their Gore attack misses, if the ceradon pins two or more creatures beneath it, it remains stationary, concentrating on crushing them. 

The Armoured Crest reaction is used strategically, saved for countering potent spell attacks or deflecting high damage strikes, such as a rogue's sneak attack.

##### Ceradon Howdah Weapons 

Skinks usually man the ceradon's howdah. They employ long-range poison weapons integrated into the howdah to target enemies beyond the ceradon's reach, especially when the ceradon is stationary because it's pinning victims or it's pursuing elusive targets.

\columnbreak



#### The Thunderous One 

**Thunderous Wrath:** When the Thunderous One utilizes this ability, it repels adversaries not restrained by its feet or impaled on its horns, creating distance between it and its next target for an effective charge and Gore attack.

##### Thunderous One Legendary Actions

The Thunderous One utilizes its legendary actions in the following ways:

**Storm God's Judgement:** This legendary action is reserved for use against a creature impaled on the ceradon's horns or trapped beneath its feet. The Thunderous One instinctively employs this legendary action in this way, even without external guidance.

**Trample:** If there are no eligible targets for Storm God's Judgement, the Thunderous One defaults to this action. When under the guidance of more intelligent beings, it prefers to use this ability if it can potentially overrun more adversaries than those already pinned beneath it.

**Tenacious Will:** This action is invoked solely when its stomping and goring abilities are hindered or interrupted.


#### Engine of the Gods 

When operating a howdah equipped with an Engine of the Gods, understanding the sequence of how abilities should be used is crucial. Here's the recommended priority order:

1. Portent of Warding
2. Sacred Summon
3. Time Slows
4. Arcane Configuration
5. Burning Alignment
6. Healing Light

### Ceradon Loot
The valuable items looted from ceradons will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a Ceradon. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Ceradon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Ceradon Loot Table

## Cold Bloods

These large raptors roam far and wide in large, rapacious packs tearing apart any warm-blooded creatures they come across. Cold bloods are known for their wild blood lust, vicious weaponry, and propensity for hunting in packs to bring down much larger prey.

 Their sheer aggression is among their most dangerous traits, for wounded cold bloods do not flee but instead, become more recklessly aggressive. Even attempts to pacify or frighten a cold blood with magic will simply make it wilder and angrier.

Cold bloods are extremely simple-minded, even by dinosaur standards. Though they have an instinctive ability to hunt in packs, their ability to assess complex situations and execute appropriate strategies is severely limited. Most cold bloods will pursue prey heedless of any danger which presents itself.

Despite their limited intelligence and aggressive natures, cold bloods can be successfully broken into mounts at scale. Because their territories range across many climates, they have been adopted for military use by multiple races. However, the lizardmen, who share their primordial jungle homes with the cold bloods, were the first to do so. Many of their saurian warriors are spawned with blessings that grant them a natural kinship with wild reptilian beasts and lend them to being natural cavalry fighters atop the vicious cold bloods. These mounted warriors make for devastating shock cavalry capable of running down and ripping apart even the hardiest of foes. 



### Horned Cold Bloods
These extremely rare raptors are thought to be near-extinct relatives of the cold bloods. They are only found deep in the primeval jungles where the lizardmen also make their home. Horned cold bloods don’t roam as far and wide as cold bloods and instead guard specific stretches of jungle they regard as their territory. Though horned cold bloods are significantly more intelligent than cold bloods, they are extremely protective of their turf and will fight to the death when attacking any intruders. As their name suggests, they are armed with boney horns, which they use to ram prey before finishing the kill with claws and teeth.

Horned cold bloods are prized mounts among the lizardmen. Their rarity, intelligence, and enhanced weaponry means they are ridden by only the most elite saurian soldiers and their generals. In battle, horned cold blood riders are implacable cavalry warriors, bowling down foes without giving an inch of ground.

##### Cold Blood Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |The players have been charged with venturing into a cold blood nest to retrieve eggs.|
|  2  |A wizard has resurrected a pack of long-dead cold bloods, which have broken free and now roam his lab. |
|  3  |The players have been tasked with capturing cold bloods to use as mounts. However, they soon find themselves in competition with lizardmen hunters.    |
|  4  |A cohort of lizardmen cold blood cavalry is moving through the countryside near their jungle home, sacking every minor warmblood settlement they find.|
|  5  |While lost in a deep jungle, the players find what appears to be a clear path out. The only catch is that it runs through horned cold blood territory.   |
|  6  | A saurian commander has gained control of a horned cold blood which he now uses as his savage steed to lead a lizardmen crusade against the warmblooded races.    |

### Cold Blood Tactics

Cold bloods are hyper-aggressive and have very low intelligence. Outside of making use of their Pack Tactics ability whenever possible, they don’t have any sophisticated combat tactics. They will simply try to gang up on and bring down the weakest prey they can spot. Allow them to fall for most ploys the party attempts, and let the players use their stupidity against them.

When used as mounts, their tactics will reflect that of the rider. However, the optimal strategy will still usually be to run down and gang up on vulnerable targets while hoping the cold blood doesn’t rapamge in the process.

#### Horned Cold Bloods

This variant should be played more intelligently and not fall for obvious ploys the same way cold bloods would. 

**Charge + Pact Tactics.** Whenever possible, horned cold bloods should use their Charge ability to target an enemy who has an ally within 5 feet of it, so they can combine it with their Pact Tactics. If they are mounted, this will be a non-issue.

### Cold Blood Loot
The valuable items looted from cold bloods will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cold blood. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

\columnbreak

#### Cold Blood Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Crox

Within the enigmatic lizardmen society, the crox stand as towering sentinels, dedicated protectors, and potent laborers. They are hulking creatures, towering above other lizardfolk. Their bodies are covered in armored scales, ranging in colors from deep blues to vivid greens and earthy browns.

Their heads resemble a blend of crocodile and lizard, featuring jaws capable of crushing stone and metal. Their powerful limbs, which end in deadly claws, enable them to move with surprising speed for their size.

The crox serve as the backbone of the lizardmen’s physical endeavors. In times of peace, they perform hard labor, assisting in the construction of temples, moving massive stone blocks, and dredging channels in the marshes. During war, they stand at the forefront of the Lizardfolk’s armies, swinging colossal weapons and smashing through enemy lines with their sheer might. 

While they are unmatched in physical strength, the Crox possess a simpler intellect than their smaller kin. As a result, they are often guided and directed by lizardmen leaders or skinks. Their loyalty to their kin is unwavering, and they carry out their tasks with a dedication that is both admirable and, at times, frightening.

### Sacred Crox

Some crox warriors are chosen to become something greater, something revered and sacred. These sacred crox, embody the very spirit of the gods the lizardmen worship. Not every crox has the potential to undergo this transformation. The process starts when skink shamen receive divine visions in their meditations, hinting at a particular crox that has been chosen by the gods. These crox are then taken to sacred groves, where they undergo rigorous rituals, awakening their latent divine power.

The Sacred Guardians are distinct from their Crox brethren. Their scales shimmer with an ethereal glow, reflecting hues that seem impossible in the natural world. Depending on the deity they are connected with, their eyes may burn with the cool blue of a serene lake, the fierce red of a blazing fire, or the deep green of the densest forest. And, while any crox could be spawned with unique markings displaying the blessings of one of their gods, the sacred crox are much more likely to carry these blessings, and their scales shine with the power they bestow.

This effect can't reduce a creature's AC below 1. At the end of the creature's turn, if it hasn't received a Static Wound since its last turn, it loses all Static Wounds.

In battle, sacred crox are equipped with ornate gauntlets designed to channel their divine power into devesting blows. The strikes delivered with these weapons are not just capable of shattering bone, but unleashing radiant blasts of divine power. Sacred crox lumber into battle with these weapons, often using them to knuckle walk, before barrelling into foes and smashing them to a bloody pulp.

One group of sacred crox warriors have gained a special notoriety among enemies and allies alike. Known as the storm warriors, these crox have received special blessings from the lizardmen storm god. Their bodies are infused with the storm god's divine might, allowing them to channel lightning through their sacred gauntlets. Their blows statically charge their prey, leaving them with supernatural wounds that make them vulnerable to continued assaults. Storm warriors and their allies can use this tactic to quickly take down even the sturdiest foes with their divine onslaught.

### Crox Ancients
The crox ancients stand as living relics of the lizardfolk's past. These behemoths, blessed with extended lifespans, are easily distinguished by their colossal size, weathered scales, and the moss or lichen that grows on their forms, symbolizing their deep connection to the land.

Their longevity grants them a unique blend of instinctual war knowledge and experiential wisdom. Though they are not traditional thinkers, their primal understanding of combat and strategy makes them unparalleled tacticians. They lead not with complex orders, but with actions and guttural roars and shouts that their troops instinctively understand, creating a primal unity on the battlefield.

Crox ancients often wander the wilds, battling mighty beasts to test themselves as they grow stronger and wiser over the centuries. They have an uncanny knack for showing up when lizardmen forces are overwhelmed and in disarray. With their imposing aura of power and authority, they rally and lead whole lizardmen armies into battle where the crox ancient can unleash its titanic strength upon its hapless foes. Despite their ancient wisdom, they often lose themselves to bloodlust in battle, unleashing a primordial fury so terrible it scars the minds of those who witness it.

### Crox Tactics


Crox are inherently primal brutes, often attacking the nearest opponent out of pure instinct. These behemoths may fight using simple tactics and mindless aggression when on their own, but their true potential is unlocked when they are guided by smaller, more intelligent creatures, such as skinks.

In the hierarchy of Lizardmen, crox serve as formidable bodyguards and frontline soldiers. Although savage by nature, they display a surprising kinship with skinks. This unlikely alliance leads to the crox fiercely protecting skinks, even willing to risk their own lives to protect their allies unless instructed otherwise by a trusted skink companion.

The tactics described here are designed for use when crox are fighting alongside skinks but can be equally effective with other small, skirmishing humanoid units paired with crox.

Typically, the crox form the front line, advancing on the enemy. Directly behind them, the skinks utilize the crox's massive size as a protective wall. During their turn, the skinks maneuver through the crox to either engage any enemy units already in combat with the crox or, if the crox have yet to engage, to carry out ranged attacks.

Once their attacks are complete, the skinks retreat to safety behind the crox. They can also opt to use their bonus action to hide, leveraging the crox as cover if they possess the **Vanish** feature.

Should a crox go into a rampage, the skinks remain by its side until the battle appears lost or the crox can no longer provide sufficient cover.

#### Sacred Crox

Though sacred crox are more powerful than their ordinary kin and possess different types of weapons, they fight using the same tactics as typical crox. 

#### Blessings of the Old Ones
Crox with different blessings will follow mostly the same tactics as normal warriors, making small adjustments <br> to maximum their blessing's effect as nessecary. If <br> they have blessings that work with the rampage <Br> condition, there may be more circumstances <Br> in which they use their bite to try and enter <br> a rampage early.

\columnbreak


#### Crox Storm Warriors
Under the guidance of a more intelligent strategist, one or more storm warriors will concentrate their efforts on a single target, attempting to inflict as many Static Wounds as possible. Given that these wounds vanish after a round of not being hit by one of the storm warriors, the skink handlers encourage the crox to take substantial risks to maintain the infliction of these wounds on high-priority targets.

Any skinks concealed behind the crox will simultaneously concentrate their attacks on the now weakened target, utilizing javelins and poison. The weakened state of the target makes it more susceptible to these attacks, increasing the likelihood of successful hits and, thus, effective poisoning.


#### Crox Ancients
Despite their lack of conventional intelligence, crox ancients possess an almost instinctual sense of strategy and warfare. They can implement rudimentary tactics and issue near-animalistic commands to other crox, although they operate more like a pack of beasts than a unit of soldiers.
While crox ancients demonstrate greater intellect than their counterparts, they are most effective when paired with skinks, who serve as their advisors.

For optimal strategic placement, the crox ancients should be situated in the center of their group's formation. This position maximizes the benefit of its Aura of Endurance trait and its Coordinated Maul attack.

However, when a crox ancient begins to rampage, if there are no skinks nearby to maintain order, all crox in the vicinity lose any semblance of strategic cohesion.

### Crox Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from crox are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Though crox don't often collect these items themselves, other lizardmen often adorn them with bones, jewelry, and ornaments of precious metal for ceremonial purposes. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Crox Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Dread Saurus
These primeval titans are among the most feared <br> and powerful creatures that inhabit the jungles and <br> ruins of the lizardmen’s homeland. They are colossal quadrupedal, reptilian beasts, standing taller than even <br> the largest sauropods, and are protected by massive, armoured plates inscribed with ancient prophecies. 

Dread sauruses are revered as sacred beasts by the lizardmen, who keep them in mountainous temples where they receive offerings and sacrifices from skink priests. They are among the most valuable assets of the lizardmen army, as their ferocity and near-indestructibility make them devastating foes.


In the battlefield, the dread saurus can charge into enemy lines, crushing and trampling any foes in its path, and its powerful tail can sweep away entire squads of soldiers in a single stroke. Most deadly of all are its colossal, crocodilian jaws, capable of crushing and tearing the most formidable of foes into bloody shreds.

***Skink Handlers and Howdahs.*** The dread saurus is often accompanied by skink handlers who can direct its attacks and use their own abilities to bolster its strength or weaken its enemies. These handlers can also provide healing and support to keep the creature fighting even in the face of overwhelming odds.

The skinks often direct the dread saurus from armored fortifications attached to its back, known as howdahs. They provide vital protection to the skink riders and are equipped with a variety of weapons, such as ballistae and giant blowpipes, which can be used to eliminate foes out of the dread saurus’s reach.

In addition to its combat capabilities, the dread saurus’s howdah is also used by the lizardmen as a means of transport. The howdah can carry additional supplies and equipment, making it an essential asset for military campaigns in the dense jungles of the lizardmen's homeland.

>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The dread saurus can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes a claw attack against any number of targets in a 10-foot-long and 20-foot-wide area that emanates from the dread saurus in a direction of its choice. It can replace one of the attacks with Bite or Crushing Jaws. It can then immediately make a tail attack against any number of targets in a 30-foot-long and 20-foot-wide area that emanates from the dread saurus in the opposite direction of its claw attacks. The dread saurus can't move between attacks.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 41 (5d12 + 9) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 23). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the dread saurus can't bite another target.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not grappled by the dread saurus. *Hit:* 23 (4d8 + 9) slashing damage.
>
> ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target not grappled by the dread saurus. *Hit:* 23 (4d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ***Crushing Jaws.*** If the dread saurus has a target grappled with its bite attack, that target must make a DC 23 Strength saving throw or take 74 (10d12 + 9) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 13), the damage is doubled. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it dies.
>
>  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dread saurus’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dread saurus and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dread saurus’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Obliterating Charge.*** The dread saurus moves up to 50 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, it may make a claw attack against that creature.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Wounded Charge.*** When the dread saurus's hit points drop to 0 or it triggers its Primal Instinct ability, it can use its Obliterating Charge action. After using this action, the dread saurus dies if its hit points are 0.

***Artifacts of the Old Ones.*** Dread sauruses are often equipped with ancient relics believed to have been left behind by the inscrutable gods of the lizardmen. These artifacts are embedded in the dread saurus by its skink handlers and grant it arcane powers it can access at will. They may grant the dread saurus extra resilience, summon the spirits of dead warriors, or even allow it to channel the sun's energy through its body. When the divine powers of these artifacts are combined with the dread saurus’s primal might, it becomes a nigh unstoppable force of nature.

Dread sauruses equipped with these artifacts are considered avatars of the Old Ones' will. They are revered and protected by the lizardmen, not that they need much in the way of protection. Occasionally, particularly bold or mad relic seekers will attempt to hunt down these dread sauruses and pry the artifacts from their grasp. Such attempts nearly always end in disaster for the would-be treasure hunters.

\columnbreak

***The Dread Ripper.*** This dread saurus is believed to be the oldest and mightiest of its kind in existence. Its title stems from its record of shredding through any foe that has been foolish enough to stand against it. With its devastating natural weapons and near-limitless vitality, the Dread Ripper has singlehandedly shattered armies and leveled forts.

The Dread Ripper is thought to have walked the world since the time of the Old Ones, and the lizardmen revere it as a demi-god. In times of dire need, they will equip it with artifacts of the Old Ones and a war howdah crewed by only the worthiest of skinks. Despite its limited intelligence, the Dread Ripper possesses a near-supernatural aura of authority, and other lizardmen and jungle beasts will naturally flock to its side when it lumbers into battle.

### Dread Saurus Artifacts

The dread saurus can be equipped with a magical artifact that grants it additional abilities and increases its CR by 2.

#### Spirit Eye

*A mystic crystal is embedded in the dread saurus, which allows it to call forth primal warriors from ages past.*

At the start of its turn, the dread saurus can summon three specters in unoccupied spaces within 90 feet of it. The specters act immediately after the dread saurus on the same initiative count and fight until they are destroyed. They disappear after 1 minute or when the dread saurus dies. The specters summoned with this ability have the following changes:
* They are not affected by Sunlight Sensitivity.
* They have a melee spell attack instead of Life Drain. The attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and targets one creature. On a hit, the attack deals 10 (3d6) force damage


#### Heart of Stone

*A large, eldritch stone is fused into the back of the dread saurus. The dread saurus can use the stone to draw the power of the earth into its body and become as unyielding as a mountain.*

At the end of the dread saurus's turn, if it has not moved on that turn and is standing on earth or stone, it gains a +3 bonus to AC, saving throws, and opposed checks. This ability can stack up to two times. The dread saurus loses all stacks if it moves or is forced to move.

While equipped with this artifact, the dread saurus's Primal Instinct ability is triggered only by it becoming charmed or frightened.

\columnbreak

#### Mantle of the Blazing Dawn 

*Strange golden patterns are etched across the dread saurus’s scales. As the beast charges, the markings flare and burn with divine radiance.*

Claw attacks made by the dread saurus when using its Obliterating Charge ability deal an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage and 10 (3d6) radiant damage on hit.


#### Primal Jaws

*The dread saurus’s teeth are etched with runes and gilded with rare metal to honor the most ancient of bestial gods. When the dread suarian crushes foes with its sacred jaws, it awakens a primal vigor in its allies.*

When the dread saurus uses its Crushing Jaws on a hostile creature, it and each ally within 100 feet of it gain 20 temporary hit points for the next minute. If the creature fails the saving throw against Crushing Jaws, they each gain 30 temporary hit points instead. If it fails by 10 or more, they each gain 40 temporary hit points instead.

#### Rebus of the Jungle

*Stange, magical, light-bending vines grow across the dread saurus and help mask its presence. These plants also help it to move through dense undergrowth undetected by its prey.*   

The dread saurus gets +11 to stealth checks and can move though plants without being slowed, taking damage, being grappled or restrained.

While dread saurus is lightly obscured, it is invisible to any creatures more then 10 feet away form it. If the dread saurus has a Howdah, the Howdah and the  Creatures inside of it gain this benefit as well

#### Figures of Dread

*The dread saurus wears a massive headdress lined with menacing statues, amplifying its already terrifying nature such that none can look upon it without experiencing mortal terror.*

The following ability replaces the dread saurus’s Frightful Presence:

 ***Dread Presence.*** Each creature of the dread saurus's choice within 120 feet that is aware of it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. All creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw unless they are within 5 feet of an ally. Creatures normally immune to being frightened can still be affected, but have advantage on their saves. While frightened, the creature can only use its actions to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or steel its resolve. A creature that uses its action to steel its resolve can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the dread saurus's Dread Presence for the next 24 hours.

### Howdahs
You can equip a dread saurus with one of the howdahs described in the Howdah section earlier in this document. This can include any of the howdah upgrades described in that section as well.

\pagebreakNum

### Dread Saurus Tactics
Dread sauruses are extremely belligerent and consistently seek to attack the largest group of enemies to inflict the most damage possible. They rarely consider going after the weakest targets. Their belligerence is so extreme that dread sauruses will usually fight to the death, rampaging to the very end.

#### Dread Saurus Ripper Tactics
The only real difference in tactics with a dread saurus ripper involves its legendary actions, which are used in the following circumstances:

* **Swat.** This is used when dread saurus has a creature in its mouth, and another creature is causing a large amount of damage that it wishes to be rid of.
* **Mangle.** If the dread saurus doesn't have any creature in its mouth and is attempting to catch fleeing prey, it will usually use this after using an obliterating charge.
* **Gnaw.** The dread saurus will use this action whenever possible, unless under the effects of a debilitating condition where it needs to use Tenacious Will.
* **Obliterating Charge.** The dread saurus uses this action to catch up with fleeing prey.

#### Dread Saurus Howdah Tactics
Dread sauruses on their own are generally not a significant threat to high-level parties as their dimwitted tactics and basic attacks can usually be countered by the many options players have at those levels. However, a howdah allows dread sauruses to be directed by intelligent creatures and should be filled with riders equipped with ranged attacks to create a more well-rounded threat.

The creatures in the howdah do not have to be tough, as the +5 to all saving throws, AC from cover, and damage reduction mean that the crew is well-defended as long as they stay within the structure. Their job should be to eliminate targets the dread saurus cannot reach.

\columnbreak

#### Dread Saurus Artifact Tactics
Dread saurus upgrades can allow it to present a higher-level and more complex challenge. Here are some basic tactics for several upgrades:
* **Spirit Eye.** This is similar to the howdah in that it compensates for the dread saurus’s weakness to ranged attacks and flying creatures. The summoned spirits can disrupt enemies the dread saurus can’t reach, and their intelligence allows them to do this in tactical ways that support the dread saurus.
* **Heart of Stone.** With this upgrade, it’s best to grab one target and chew it relentlessly, only moving if there’s no one left to attack. It works well in combination with a howdah.
* **Mantle of the Blazing Dawn** With this upgrade, the dread saurus should make an obliterating charge whenever it can hit three or more targets.
* **Jaws of the Savage** This upgrade works well in combination with a howdah or other minions.
* **Rebus of the Jungle** This upgrade allows the dread saurus to behave more like an ambush predator. When it’s not rampaging, the dread saurus’s strategy should be to lure targets into underbrush and darkness.
* **Figures of Dread** This upgrade does little to change the dread saurus’s tactics.

### Dread Saurus Loot
The valuable items looted from dread sauruses will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them and whatever sacred items they’ve been adorned with. Harvesting a dread saurus’s body can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. Looting their adornments will usually involve an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest its hide.

Players should be able to do both forms of harvesting at once using separate checks for most dread sauruses. 

If a dread saurus is equipped with an artifact, you can make a second roll for adornment loot. Alternatively, the players may recover a functional magic item from the artifact.


#### Dread Saurus Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.

## Lord Krohc
*Mummified Mage-Priest Empowered By An Undying Spirit*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual <br>

The sload mage-priests who survived the perilous eons since their creation by the Old Ones are mere shadows compared to the greatest of their kind who existed at the dawn of the world. The first sload mage-priests, forged by the Old Ones, were imbued with a supreme understanding of the universe, granting them power surpassed only by their creators. With a gesture, they could conjure hurricanes or rivers, weave spells to raise continents from the ocean floor, or plunge them back into the depths. Such was their mastery over the winds of magic.

Among them, the greatest was Lord Krohc, said to be the first of his kind to come into existence. No other being possessed a deeper understanding of the Old Ones' plans for the world, and only the most powerful beings could rival the might of this unparalleled servant. Yet even his immense power was tested during the Great Cataclysm that claimed the Old Ones and engulfed the world in chaos. Despite the combined efforts of the first generation of mage-priests, their powers were barely sufficient to fend off the evil born of that disaster. The salvation of the world came at a terrible cost: the loss of the greatest spellcasters to ever grace existence.

It is said that Lord Krohc was the last of his kind to fall. For years, he tirelessly held back an army of nightmares as vast as an ocean, casting spells with enough arcane might to topple mountains. Ultimately, his horrific foes overwhelmed him, tearing him apart. With his final breath, Lord Krohc unleashed a spell that swept away the remnants of his murderers, preserving what remained of the Old Ones' grand design.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

After the dust settled, the surviving servants of the Old Ones searched vigilantly for every scattered piece of the torn sage. They reunited his remains, binding them with sacred rites and placing them once more upon his stone palanquin. A golden death mask, inset with snow-white jewels for eyes, was laid upon the body of the mighty spellcaster so that he might continue to witness the flow of fate.

To this day, Lord Krohc's remains are housed within the most sacred temple of the Old Ones, guarded by lizardmen and revered by other sload mage-priests who offer tribute. Lord Krohc has become a symbol of the era when the Old Ones' plans remained untainted. Yet, Lord Krohc remains unconquerable, for his soul clings stubbornly to his withered corpse, refusing to depart this world. Those who visit the mage-priest's tomb feel the presence of his spirit, and some claim divine revelations, believing that Krohc still seeks to guide the children of the lost gods.

In the direst times—when the enemies of the Old Ones resurface or an omen reveals a fragment of the great plan demanding swift action—the sload mage-priests carry the mummified saint from his resting place, borne by his lizardfolk guardians. When roused, the spirit of Lord Krohc can draw celestial power to replicate the final spell he cast in life. Though its destructive force is minuscule when compared with the earthshaking incantation unleashed at the end of his life, it remains capable of grinding armies to dust once the venerable mage-priest's spirit completes his ritual.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Annul.*** If Lord Krohc fails a saving throw, he can choose to expend a Level of Power to succeed instead.
>
> ***Hypnotic Death Mask.*** Whenever any creature tries to attack Lord Krohc for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 22. <br>
> *Failure:* The creature is Charmed by Lord Krohc until the end of the turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. <br>
> *Success:* The creature can attack Lord Krohc on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against Lord Krohc’s spells on its next turn.
>
> ***Telepathic Shroud.*** Lord Krohc is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts, as well as to all Divination spells.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Spatial Shift.*** Lord Krohc teleports up to 60 feet to a point he can see, one he can visualize, or one he can describe by stating distance and direction.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Eldritch Deliverance.*** Lord Krohc casts *Eldritch Deliverance*. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22). The spell’s effective level is increased by 1 for each level of power the mage priest has.
>
> ***Arcane Blast.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 150 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) Force damage.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Lord Krohc gains three additional actions in combat: Summmon Beacons, Essence Rend, and Resonating Pulse. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count (losing ties), separate from Lord Krohc’s own, if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace any action with Tenacious Will, and he can use Tenacious Will and Summmon Beacons even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Summmon Beacons (Initiative Count 30).*** Lord Krohc creates four Eldritch Beacons in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of himself. These Eldritch Beacons last until Initiative Count 30 of the next round. They act on their own turns on Initiative Count 1 and can only take the Infuse action on their turn.
>
> ***Essence Rend (Initiative Count 15).*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 150 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) Necrotic damage, and the target’s soul is Rended for the next minute. While Rended, the creature takes 22 (4d10) Necrotic damage on Initiative Count 16 (losing ties) of each round. The effect ends early if the target regains 20 or more hit points in a single turn, or if a *Dispel Evil and Good* or *Greater Restoration* spell is cast on the target.
>
> ***Resonating Pulse (Initiative Count 5).*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 150 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) Thunder damage, and the target is surrounded by rippling energy for the next minute. While surrounded by rippling energy, the creature is Restrained. If a creature other than Lord Krohc within 10 feet of the target casts a 1st-level or higher spell, the caster takes 22 (4d10) Thunder damage, and the rippling energy dissipates.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Lord Krohc is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.
>

### Epic Battle: Indomitable Spirit
When Lord Krohc dies, you may choose to have his spirit rise from the remains. The spirit has the same stat block as Lord Krohc, except it has the following changes:

* The spirit loses the Golden Death Mask trait.
* The spirit is immune to all damage, as well as being Charmed, Exhausted, frightened, Grappled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone, or Restrained.
* The spirit can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) Force damage, which ignores all damage immunities, if it ends its turn inside an object.
* Soul Struggle: Any creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the spirit may choose to Struggle with the spirit. The Struggle lasts as long as the creature maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) or until the spirit dies, up to a maximum of 10 minutes. While Struggling with the spirit, the creature ignores the spirit’s damage immunities. If the concentration breaks while the spirit is alive, the creature takes 27 (6d8) Force damage and is Dazed* until the end of its next turn.


Lord Krohc's spirit may perform an 8-hour ritual to his original body, fully restoring him, or providing a new body if the original no longer exists.

When Lord Krohc has access to this ability, both forms combined are treated as a CR 28 creature.

### Lord Krohc's Tactics

Lord Krohc’s primary objective in battle is to protect both himself and his Eldritch Beacons, ensuring he can gather enough power to unleash Eldritch Deliverance and annihilate his foes. He relies on his flight to stay mobile and out of reach of most threats.

**Eldritch Deliverance.** Lord Krohc casts Eldritch Deliverance every turn if possible. He prioritizes targeting the maximum number of enemies, but will focus specifically on creatures that suffer disadvantage on the saving throw due to his Hypnotic Death Mask trait.

**Summon Beacon.** The Eldritch Beacons are deliberately placed as far apart as possible to minimize the risk of being caught by area-of-effect spells. 

**Essence Rend.** This attack is used against a creature with the lowest AC that is not yet wounded.

**Resonating Pulse.** This attack targets a melee martial fighter that is unable to cast spells, making it as hard as possible to remove the resonating energy.

**Annul.** Used whenever there is something incapacitating Lord Krohc or preventing him from casting spells. 

#### Lord Krohc Epic Battle

Lord Krohc’s tactics remain relatively the same, except that he focuses on breaking the concentration of creatures Struggling with his spirit.

\columnbreak

#### New Spell: Eldritch Deliverance
*1st-level Evocation (Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of meteorite)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a sudden pulse of eldritch energy at a point you can see within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 Force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 2d6, the radius increases by 5 feet, and the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Echoes of the Final Spell.** An ancient battlefield, long buried beneath volcanic rock, suddenly surges with magic. Survivors whisper of glowing runes and ashstorms that move against the wind. Sload seers believe the residual energy of Lord Krohc’s final spell has become unstable, threatening to erupt again. The adventurers must descend into the heart of the ruined valley to anchor the fading echo and potentially face a remnant of Krohc's spirit.  |
|  2  |**The Lost Fragment.** An ancient vault believed lost since the Great Cataclysm has been discovered—within it lies a shard of Lord Krohc's original body, believed destroyed. This fragment pulses with arcane resonance, and several factions want it for themselves, claiming it holds spells lost to time. The adventurers may be tasked with retrieving or destroying the fragment before it falls into the wrong hands. |
|  3  |**The Echo War.** In an ancient memory vault beneath the temple-city, the adventurers activate a long-forgotten geomantic interface that replays the final hours of Lord Krohc’s last battle—complete with real enemies, magical terrain, and Lord Krohc himself reconstructed as a projection of war. But something goes wrong, and the simulation locks in place. Now fully aware, Krohc’s echo mistakes the adventurers for agents of chaos, and the party must survive his wrath in a gauntlet forged from the past. |
|  4  | **The Disturbed Slumber.** During a full celestial alignment, an opportunistic faction attempts to resurrect Lord Krohc entirely, believing they can return him to life to serve their own ends. The ritual succeeds only in disorienting and enraging Krohc's spirit. The adventurers must either subdue the rampaging entity or complete a different ritual to bring him peace once more.|

### Lord Krohc Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from sload mage-priests are the ancient relics they carry with them. However, some more macabre looters may harvest their remains for materials that hold some lingering power. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** checks. At the DM's discretion, harvesting their bodies can be done using an **Intelligence (Medicine)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Lord Krohc Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## The Last Defender

In the annals of lizardmen history, few heroes are revered as fervently as The Last Defender and his ferocious carnosaur steed, Grimlokk. The two are forever linked by their valor, their triumphs, and their unwavering commitment to their people.

The title of "The Last Defender" is not simply a moniker but a testament to this saurian general's valor and determination. As waves of ravenous demons beset a key lizardmen city, it was The Last Defender who rallied the last battalion of saurian warriors. Against overwhelming odds, they held their ground, ensuring the city's crucial artifacts were safeguarded and its legacy preserved.

Physically, The Last Defender is an imposing figure. Towering over other saurian, his scales bear the hues of deep azure mixed with streaks of golden yellow, symbolizing his celestial blessings. His age is marked by countless scars, each narrating tales of brutal confrontations, and his eyes shimmer with a wisdom and determination few can match.

A master tactician, The Last Defender is renowned for his skill in jungle warfare. He employs the dense foliage and treacherous terrain to stage deadly ambushes, leveraging the element of surprise to decimate his enemies. An aura of mystical defense surrounds him, granting divine protection to him and those nearby. In his hand, he wields a revered magical spear, said to be a gift from the gods.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 Those unfortunate enough to be struck by it are tormented by nightmarish visions that fracture their very psyche. Complementing this is a gauntlet, worn on his left arm, capable of harnessing the sun's fury and releasing it in searing blasts upon his foes.

Grimlokk, The Last Defender’s loyal carnosaur, is a beast of nightmares. Larger and more ferocious than his kin, his dark scales are perfect for moving unseen through the dense jungles. While he possesses the raw power to tear enemies apart, he shows remarkable finesse in stalking and ambushing his prey, particularly targeting those already wounded to ensure their swift demise.

The bond between The Last Defender and Grimlokk transcends that of warrior and mount. Grimlokk obeys every command, every nuance, making their combat dance a seamless blend of precision and brutality. They function as extensions of one another, coordinating their attacks to maximize their impact on the battlefield.

Together, The Last Defender and Grimlokk symbolize the undying spirit of the lizardmen civilization. Their tales, spoken in hushed reverence by the skinks, serve as reminders of the sacrifices made and the relentless fight to ensure their race's survival in a world rife with threats. Their legacy is not just of victory, but of duty, resilience, and undying determination.

### Epic Encounter: <Br> The Defender  & The Beast
If you wish to combine The Last Defender and Grimlokk in one encounter, you can grant them the following shared abilities. When using these abilities, treat them as a CR 25 creature for the purposes of  XP and encounter difficulty.

***Attuned to the Beast:*** When Grimlokk serves as The Last Defender's mount, The Last Defender can direct Grimlokk to take the Attack action once during each of The Last Defender's turns. If either Grimlokk or The Last Defender is reduced to 0 hit points, the other enters a Rampage state that lasts for one minute. While in this Rampage, they have advantage on attack rolls and deal an additional 11 (2d10) damage on successful hits.


#### Shared Legendary Actions
Grimlokk and The Last Defender possess a joint pool of 3 legendary actions when they are engaged in combat together, choosing from the options detailed below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time between both of them and only at the end of another creature's turn. They regain their expended legendary actions at the start of The Last Defender's turn. Should one of them fall, the other retains the ability to use these actions for the subsequent hour.

**Check.** Either Grimlokk or The Last Defender can perform a skill check that would ordinarily require an action.

**Movement.** Grimlokk or The Last Defender can move up to 30 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. Should Grimlokk or The Last Defender come within 5 feet of each other during this movement, The Last Defender can instantly mount Grimlokk, provided he has a movement speed of 5ft or more. Additionally, he can opt to dismount Grimlokk at any time during this movement.

**Claw.** Grimlokk makes a claw attack.

**Spear.** The Last Defender makes an attack with the Spear of Dread Visions. If the attack hits a creature, that creature is afflicted with a vision (described in the attack description).

**Tenacious Will.** If either Grimlokk or The Last Defender is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. This legendary action can be used while incapacitated.

**Deadly Onslaught. (Costs 2 Actions)** Both Grimlokk and The Last Defender launch a wild barrage of attacks. Every creature within 5 feet of either of them must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) slashing damage and is inflicted with a carnosaur wound (as described in Grimlokk's Bite attack). However, if a creature that fails the save is within 5 feet of both The Last Defender and Grimlokk, it sustains two wounds.

**Roar of Reckoning. (Costs 2 Actions)** Grimlokk and The Last Defender simultaneously emit powerful, divine roars in twin 120-foot cones. Any creature other than Grimlokk and The Last Defender in the area of either cone must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it loses concentration, is knocked prone, and is inflicted with a vision (as described in The Last Defender's Spear of Dread Visions attack). If a creature is in the area of both cones, it receives two visions on a failed save.

### Last Defender <br> & Grimlokk Tactics

The Last Defender is a masterful warrior known for his strategic prowess. He often waits for the opportune moment to ambush foes and unleash his unique abilities. His loyal companion Grimlokk, follows his every command, creating potent synergy between their capabilities. 

**Wounds and Visions:** Both The Last Defender and Grimlokk have abilities that can stack damaging effects on enemies. These effects become highly debilitating at three stacks. In combat, prioritize stacking these effects.

**Sacred Wrath:** The Last Defender's Sacred Wrath reaction is reserved for adversaries with low Charisma, who will likely fail the saving throw.

**Blood Tracking:** This aids The Last Defender and Grimlokk in relentlessly pursuing wounded enemies. 

**Starting Turn:** Begin by stealthily approaching targets with The Last Defender mounted on Grimlokk. Once in position, Grimlokk should use its Frightful Presence and the defender should use his Sacred Aura. Focus the initial attacks on the most vulnerable enemy. If needed, leverage Grimlokk's ability to move with legendary actions to close distance. <Br><br>

**The Last Defender's Multiattack Sequence:**
* Initiate with a Tail Trip attack, followed by a Bite attack on the same target.
* Make the spear attack against the enemy with the most visions, even if the target is at a distance.
* For foes beyond Grimlokk's reach, such as flying enemies, use the Hand of Gods attack.



**Grimlokk's Multiattack Sequence:**
* Begin with a bite attack to grapple and restrain a target.
* Take advantage of the grappled foe by using a claw attack against it.
* After a bite and claw, it may make sense to carry a grappled target away from allies who could help it. Either way, Grimlokk should make a tail attack against another target if able.



**The Last Defender & Grimlokk's Legendary Actions:**
* **Movement:** The Last Defender can mount/dismount Grimlokk. Beyond closing this to close in on foes, they can also coordinate their movement to strategically split opponents. For example, Grimlokk could grapple a paladin with a protective aura and carry him away from the party, leaving them with The Last Defender.
* **Claw or Spear:** Choose which of these attacks to use based on which debuff stack (wounds or visions) is closer to 3 on the target.
* **Roar of Recking & Deadly Onslaught:** Use either of these abilities if you can affect four or more targets. These abilities are important ways to quickly stack wounds and visions on targets.

**Important Note:** Once either The Last Defender or Grimlokk falls in battle, the tactical strategies outlined above no longer apply.

### Grimlokk & <br>The Last Defender Loot
Valuable items looted from Grimlokk will generally come from whatever can be harvested from it. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a carnosaur. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Because saurian are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Last Defender are the remains of the equipment he was using or valuables he was carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. 

If you are combining Grimlokk and The Last Defender for a single epic boss battle, you can have them drop some truly valuable artifacts. These artifacts can be harvested or found the same way you find loot from The Last Defender. Though, you may change the checks to Intelligence (Religion) or Intelligence (Arcana) depending on the nature of the artifacts.

As an alternative to making any checks, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Grimlokk & <br>The Last Defender Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Lord Mazhalmundi
*Ancient Mage-Priest & Arbiter of The Great Plan*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual <br>

Among the hoary mage-priests who, in ages past, wielded immense magical power to shape the world according to the designs of the Old Ones, none surpass Lord Mazhalmundi in age or arcane might. These ancient spellcasters were created to enact the will of godlike beings from beyond the stars—creatures who came to a primordial world and sought to mold it into a perfect design. Of those mage-priests who still survive into the present age, Mazhalmundi stands alone as the greatest. His power eclipses that of his peers, and his mind still carries echoes of the instructions handed down by the Old Ones themselves.

At the dawn of the world, Mazhalmundi was instructed in the arcane arts by the greatest of the mage-priests—those who spoke directly with the Old Ones themselves. So vast was his power that he could topple mountains and carve gaping rivers, shaping the world to the specifications of his divine creators. Yet, even with the mage-priests' masterful spellcraft and the Old Ones’ unmatched might, their vision for the world was never fulfilled. A calamity of unimaginable magnitude befell the planet, causing the Old Ones to vanish—whether slain in the cataclysm or abandoning their creations remains a mystery, even to the most learned mage-priests. Those who survived the initial devastation were soon assailed by abominations born from the chaos, which ravaged the land and plunged it into further discord.

In the wars that followed, all of the greatest mage-priests were lost in battle. Mazhalmundi and many of his kin had their minds tainted by the same chaos that had unmade the realms—their thoughts and calculations obscured by the disorder that flowed about them like a thick fog. Many entered deep trances in an effort to realign their minds and discern what must be done now that the Old Ones no longer guided their path.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

As the ages passed, Mazhalmundi remained motionless within his golden temple, hidden in the deepest jungles and protected by vigilant lizardmen who guarded the ancient sage for generations, awaiting his awakening.

In recent days, as the younger races arrogantly journey to forgotten lands to plunder and conquer, many relics left behind by the Old Ones have fallen into the hands of fools with no reverence or understanding of their true power. In his transcendent state, Mazhalmundi sensed this growing threat—and he rose once more. Over countless years, he had purged his mind of the corruption that hinders his brethren and reclaimed a portion of his former might. He has now determined what must be done to continue the Old Ones’ designs.

Mazhalmundi has concluded that before any new phase of the plan can begin, all species not crafted by the Old Ones must be eliminated—for their very existence disrupts the divine blueprint and halts the progress of its orderly fulfillment.

With these revelations fixed within the spellcaster’s unfathomable mind, his pronouncements echo psychically across the world. The oracles and lesser mage-priests of the lizardmen have heard his decree and gathered their forces to purge the mistakes that plague the world.

As for Mazhalmundi himself, he prepares to leave his sanctum, placing his great stone palanquin upon the fiercest of ceradon bound to his will. Atop this mighty beast, those he deems unworthy of the Old Ones' plan are swept aside with a wave of his amphibious hand, as the winds of magic bend to fuel his devastating incantations. Once Mazhalmundi passes judgment, no plea or protest can sway him—for the Great Work permits no clemency.

#### Epic Battle: Herald of The Great Plan
If you wish to make Mazhalmundi into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you may have him ride atop his mighty ceradon steed **Zloq**. Together, they have a CR of 29.

\columnbreak

#### Devastation of Cities

You may give Mazhalmundi the Devastation of Cities set of actions described below; this increases his CR by 2.

<br>

> ### The Devastation of Cities
> **Cosmic Power.** When Mazhalmundi rolls initiative, he selects a point he can see and calls upon the Cosmic Powers to rend the earth. These entities, which possess an Intelligence of 24, act autonomously and always in Mazhalmundi’s best interest. For the next minute, or until Mazhalmundi dies, the Cosmic Powers remain active. While active, they are aware of the location of any creature within 120 feet of the chosen point.
>
> **Tremors - Occurs On Initiative Count 30 (Losing Ties).** The Cosmic Powers select a point within 300 feet of Mazhalmundi. A shockwave erupts from that point, forming a 90-foot-long, 30-foot-wide wave of upheaval that travels along the ground in a direction of the Powers’ choosing. The affected area becomes difficult terrain and begins to shake violently. Each creature of the Cosmic Powers’ choice standing on the ground in the area must succeed on a *Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 24*.
> 
> *Failure:* The creature is knocked Prone and cannot stand unless it uses all of its movement to do so on its next turn.
> 
> *Failure By 5+:* The creaure becomes buried, as the ground collapses beneath it. A buried creature is Restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free it with a DC 24 Strength check. This check has advantage if the creature attempting it has a Burrow speed.
>
> **Fissure - Occurs On Initiative Count 0 (Losing Ties).** 
The affected ground collapses, forming a fissure 40 feet deep and as wide as the original tremors. If the terrain is shallower than 40 feet, the fissure opens into whatever lies beneath (such as caverns or lava). Each creature and unattended object in the area must make a  *Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 24*.
>
>*Failure:* The creature falls Prone and into the fissure, taking 6d6 Bludgeoning damage, plus any damage from falling. 
>
> *Failure By 5+:* The creature is buried under rubble. A buried creature is Restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free it with a DC 24 Strength check, with advantage if the rescuer has a Burrow speed.

>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Zloq makes a Stomp attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of it, then makes either a Gore or Bite attack. It can forgo all of its Stomp attacks to instead use its Trample action.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not in Zloq’s space. *Hit:* 24 (3d10 + 7) Piercing damage. If Zloq moves at least 20 feet straight toward the target before making this attack, the target takes an additional 16 (3d10) Piercing damage. If the target is a creature, Zloq impales it on its horns, grappling it if it is Large or smaller (escape DC 24). While grappled, the target is Restrained and takes 24 (3d10 + 7) Piercing damage at the start of each of Zloq’s turns—or 40 (6d10 + 7) if Zloq is Rampaging. Zloq cannot use its Gore attack while a creature is impaled this way.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d12 + 7) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is Prone and in the same space as Zloq, the attack instead deals 33 (4d12 + 7) Bludgeoning damage. If Zloq is Rampaging and the target is Prone, the attack is a critical hit, and the creature is paralyzed until the start of Zloq’s next turn.
>
> ***Trample.*** Zloq moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this movement, it can attempt to enter the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has moved at least 10 feet in a straight line beforehand. A creature whose space Zloq would enter must make a *Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw (target’s choice):* DC 24. <br>
> *Failure:* The creature falls Prone, takes 20 (2d12 + 7) Bludgeoning damage, and Zloq moves into its space. <br>
> *Successful Dexterity Save:* The creature takes no damage, is not knocked Prone, and is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of Zloq’s path. <br>
> *Successful Strength Save:* The creature takes half damage, is not knocked Prone, and Zloq’s movement ends. <br>
> If Zloq ends its movement in a Prone creature’s space, that creature is also Restrained until it is no longer in the same space as Zloq. While Restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 24 Strength check. On a success, the Restrained creature is pulled to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of Zloq and is no longer Restrained.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Armoured Crest.*** *Trigger:* An attacker that Zloq can see makes an attack roll against it or a creature within 5 feet of it. <br>
> *Response:* Zloq imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Mazhalmundi Tactics
Unlike typical spellcasters, Mazhalmundi leverages his cobra mace, immunity to his own spells, and mount Zloq to engage enemies up close. If Zloq dies, he falls back, keeping distance and striking lone vulnerable targets with his mace.

Mazhalmundi casts spells in the following priority order, adapting based on circumstances (e.g., enemy positions, statuses, or threats):

1. **Titanic Growth:** Cast on Zloq pre-combat if possible. (If he cannot cast it before combat starts, he prioritizes casting it immediately after Maddening Darkness.)
2. **Maddening Darkness:** Cast to maximize upfront damage before foes close in. Mazhalmundi is unaffected, so he centers it on himself for optimal coverage.
3. **Psychic Scream:** Prioritize hitting as many targets as possible.
4. **Eruption:** Target clusters of low-Dexterity or Stunned foes. Alternatively, cast into a fissure from The Ruination of Cities if 2+ creatures are trapped inside.
5. **Wrath of the Four Winds:** Use to shove low-Strength or Stunned targets back into Maddening Darkness/Eruption zones, or reposition them for Zloq's trample.
6. **Horrid Wilting:** Target as many low-Constitution foes as possible.
7. **Storm of Renewal:** Cast if Mazhalmundi or Zloq are Bloodied, or if either has suffered Poison, Blindness, or Paralysis.
8. **Sunburst:** Target groups of low-Constitution enemies.
9. **Rebounding Blades:** Hit clusters of low-Dexterity targets. Zloq can restrain foes in position to ensure they take returning blade damage.

\columnbreak

>  ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * Any Charmed or Frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.

<br>

#### Melee and Utility Actions:
* **Cobra Mace:** Use on unpoisoned targets, prioritizing spellcasters or those attuned to multiple powerful magic items.
* **Shift:** Reposition Zloq to trample multiple targets. Avoid teleporting if Zloq already has Restrained targets.
* **Adaptive Healing:** Each turn, select a damage type Mazhalmundi believes enemies cannot easily exploit against him.

#### Zloq Tactics
Zloq capitalizes on openings from Mazhalmundi's spells (e.g., Psychic Scream or Wrath of the Four Winds) by charging in to skewer foes on his horns, then dragging them into Maddening Darkness or Eruption zones for more damage.

#### The Ruination of Cities
These actions create fissures along the ground to block escaping foes (e.g., from Maddening Darkness) or drop Stunned targets into hazards.

##### Lord Mazhalmundi Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Unraveling Fault.** Lord Mazhalmundi has declared that a tectonic rift must be widened to realign continental convergence according to the Old Ones’ plan. To achieve this, he commands vast magical energies to rupture a heavily populated region, triggering earthquakes and awakening ancient volcanoes. As refugees flee and the land begins to shatter, the adventurers must uncover what cosmic threat he perceives and how to end the devastation.  |
|  2  |**Lost & Found.** A rising religious order worships the Old Ones in flawed, human-centric terms, and Mazhalmundi deems them a heretical threat to ancient world-runes buried beneath their temple. He commands their immediate extermination, and lizardfolk armies march in silence to fulfill his decree. |
|  3  |**The Star That Should Not Shine.** When a new celestial body appears in the sky, Mazhalmundi identifies it as a remnant of an ancient foe and begins constructing a titanic beacon to tear it from the heavens. Scholars and star-priests warn that disturbing the star could unravel planar stability, but the mage-priest remains unmoved. To prevent a cosmic rupture—or prove the star’s true purpose—the adventurers must act before the beacon ignites. |
|  4  | **The Fallen Void Vessel.** An enormous object crashes in the distant jungle—sleek, alien, and clearly artificial. Mazhalmundi declares it a remnant of the Old Ones' final departure and orders it sealed, even as explorers and empires rush to claim it. The adventurers may be hired by a faction to reach the wreck, discover its contents, or determine why the mage-priest wants it locked away.| 

### Lord Mazhalmundi Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from sload mage-priests are the ancient relics they carry with them. However, some more macabre looters may harvest their remains for materials that hold some lingering power. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** checks. At the DM's discretion, harvesting their bodies can be done using an **Intelligence (Medicine)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Lord Mazhalmundi Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Razorsaurs

Razorsaurs are naturally found in dense jungles, swamplands, and primordial river basins. Within the dense vegetation of their habitats, razorsaurs utilize their ability to launch spines to hunt prey or deter larger predators. These creatures are highly territorial and will almost never back down from a threat.

Skinks have learned how to keep razorsaurs in captivity for use as beasts of war. In combat, skink handlers guide the razorsaurs, relying on their natural aggression and defensive capabilities.

When goaded by their handlers, razorsaurs unleash a hail of spines, turning them into deadly living ballistae.

These capabilities allow razorsaurs to play a critical role in lizardmen strategies. Forming the backbone of their ranged artillery, these creatures can quickly decimate infantry ranks with their barrage of spines. They are also adept at charging into enemy lines, using tooth and claw to wreak havoc.

#### Venomous Razorsaurs
This rare subspecies is prized by lizardmen for its poisonous spines. Found only in the deepest wilds, venomous razorsaurs are more patient than their kin, relying on their toxic spines to slowly sap the life from their prey before moving in for the kill. In war, their skink handlers use them to debilitate entire regiments of enemy soldiers, leaving them easy prey.

### Razorsaur Tactics



&emsp;**In the Wild.** In their wetland homes, razorsaurs operate as ambush predators, typically stalking their prey through thick vegetation or by partially immersing themselves in water. Upon coming within 100 feet of their target, they release a barrage of spikes to incapacitate their prey. If the prey appears severely wounded and near death, the razorsaur moves in to deliver the fatal blow using its claws and teeth, preferring not to expend unnecessary spikes. However, if the prey still seems healthy and able to flee, the razorsaur often opts not to pursue, deeming the prey not worth the effort. Regardless of the situation, a razorsaur never flees, instead choosing to stand its ground defensively, flinging spikes at any aggressors. The razorsaur always uses its Instinctive Defense reaction when able.


**With Animal Handlers.** When directed by intelligent handlers, the razorsaur can act as a living artillery piece. Spiky Hide and Instinctive Defense provide it with a substantial deterrence against melee attackers, enabling its handlers to guide it towards enemy spellcasters and ranged attackers without facing less hindrance. Regardless of their training, razorsaurs always use their Instinctive Defense when possible, as their instincts cannot be fully suppressed.

#### Venomous Razorsaurs

&emsp;**In the Wild.** In the wild, venomous razorsaurs display a more patient approach than their ordinary counterparts. Their Razorsaur Toxins enable them to execute hit-and-run tactics, maintaining a safe distance while their poison takes effect. They always stay within firing range but avoid closing in until their prey has been significantly weakened and shows little sign of resistance. If a creature resists the toxins, the razorsaur will cease pursuit to avoid wasting spikes.

**With Animal Handlers.** When under the command of animal handlers, venomous razorsaurs serve as debuffers, spreading their poisonous spike attacks out among as many targets as possible. If one target is a greater threat, the razorsaur will allocate two of its spikes for that specific adversary to increase the odds of it being poisoned.

### Razorsaur Loot
The valuable items looted from razorsaurs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a razorsaur. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Razorsaur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

The saurian combine the features of dinosaur and man, lumbering across the battlefield clad in iron-hard scales with powerful jaws capable of tearing into even the most heavily armored foes. Beyond their natural armaments, saurian wield massive stone weaponry and shields crafted from the hides of giant jungle beasts. These physical advantages, combined with cold, ruthless discipline and intuitive tactical know-how, make even a single rank-and-file saurian warrior more than a match for the typical soldier of another race.


Though the saurian are created to be disciplined and resolute soldiers, they still possess a bestial savagery in their hearts that harkens back to their primal ancestry. Saurian pushed to their limits in battle will throw off the pretense of restraint and enter a rampage, tearing into the nearest enemies they see, heedless of danger or even their orders. 

### Sacred Spawnings

It is believed that the gods of the ancient lizardmen watch over every saurian spawning, guiding their civilization along the great plan laid for the world at the dawn of time. Occasionally, a spawning will result in a batch of saurian bearing distinct colorations and abilities. These are thought to be blessings of the Old Ones used to create specialized warriors capable of aiding the lizardmen in unique ways. Through these blessed saurian, the divine will of the Old Ones is carried out, and the great plan is actualized.

### Temple Guard
While there are many types of unique saurian spawnings that can arise depending on the needs of the Old Ones, one variant carries a special reverence. Saurian of this spawning are known as the temple guard, and they possess an iron resolve and dedication to duty beyond the rest of their kind. These saurian are made to protect their sacred charges. These charges are most often venerable mage-priests of the lizardmen, but some temple guard may be assigned to protect particularly revered relics and divine location. 

Temple guards don ancient bones and armaments and perform their duties with supernatural discipline. They can stand motionless for centuries at a time, watching for the slightest sign of danger. Should such danger arise, they spring to action without a moment’s hesitation, shielding their charge from harm while ruthlessly striking down any threat. 

Such is their discipline that temple guards can rarely be phased by circumstances that would break the will of most. Even the innate savagery of their kind is kept in check so as to ensure the protection of their charge.

The most elite among the temple guard are referred to as the chamber guardians. Their service is reserved for the most sacred of sites and most venerable of mage-priests. Their guardianship is unsurpassed, for they are never surprised and possess martial capabilities beyond that of any other saurian soldiers.

### Saurian Commanders
Though the saurian have little to no say in the day-to-day governance of the lizardmen, which is left to the skinks, or the grand, long-term plans of their civilization, which is directed by the mage-priests, the saurian are the masters of leading wartime efforts. Saurian have no known maximum lifespan and grow more powerful with age. Those who’ve endured for centuries accrue enough experience to become leaders among their kind and, thus, the principal commanders for the lizardmen as a whole. These battle-worn saurian are referred to as scar commanders. 

The centuries of hard-won wisdom scar veterens have accrued not only makes them more potent combatants but also gives them the skills necessary to direct their kin to maximum effect. While a saurian general leads the battle, he can curb the primal instincts of the beasts and lizardmen under his command. However, should the commander himself succumb to his primal instincts, the rampage of his fellow beasts and lizardmen will be all the more frenzied as they follow his savage example.

The most ancient saurian generals have survived millennia of warfare and come to be known as elder bloods, the pinnacle of martial prowess and expertise amongst the lizardmen. Elder bloods can control the forces of the lizardmen as though they’re extensions of their own body and execute intricate battle tactics as intuitively as they wield their ancient weapons. To face an elder blood is to face a thousand years of martial mastery in the form of a single indomitable warrior.

### Saurian Tactics
Saurian are direct and aggressive in their combat tactics and will usually fight to the death regardless of how dire their circumstances seem. They usually charge headlong into their foes, though they aren’t stupid about how they approach and won’t stumble into obvious traps or allow themselves to easily be put in a disadvantageous position. Saurian instinctively understand how to flank and outmaneuver foes, and they can usually pick out soft targets that need to be taken down first. 

Saurian are slightly stronger than other creatures at their CR because their Primal Instinct ability provides an exploitable weakness. As a DM, it’s important to communicate to the players when a saurian enters into a rampage what effect this appears to have on it. This way, clever players can use it to their advantage. 

#### Saurian Warriors
&emsp;**Bite.** Use this by default unless there is a commander ordering it not to. Because using bite has a chance to cause the saurian to rampage but also get another bite as a bonus action, the commander may order them to start using this attack if they are below 50 hit points and, therefore, close to rampaging anyway. Saurian will always use this in place of a shield attack if they’re rampaging.

**Maul.** Use this every turn as it is the most powerful attack.

**Shield.** Use this if a commander orders them to not use bites to avoid going into a rampage. Saurian won’t use this attack if they’re rampaging.

#### Sacred Saurian
These saurian follow mostly the same tactics as normal warriors. If they have blessings that work with the rampage condition, there may be more circumstances in which they use their bite to try and enter a rampage early.

#### Saurian Temple Guard
Temple guard, as their name implies, are designed to be bodyguards. They work especially well with spellcasters or other fragile ranged attackers. 

**Guardian’s Intervention.** Because this reaction reduces more damage if the saurian isn’t engaged in melee combat, temple guards will often stay near their charge rather than try to close in with players, even if they’re taking ranged fire.

**Sacred Duty.** It’s important to note this doesn’t stop Primal Instinct from triggering; it just suppresses the rampage condition while the temple guard is near its charge. Keep the guard close to its charge if you don’t want it running off after the nearest enemy.

#### Saurian Scar Veterens and Elder Bloods
While under the control of a saurian commander, other saurian will be much more tactical in how they attack and use their abilities. Saurian commanders have the following abilities they can use to influence the battle:

**Bite.** Because the saurian rolls 2d6 for damage, there is a much higher chance of this attack causing it to enter a rampage. The saurian will avoid using this attack unless it believes entering a rampage for the extra damage from its Primal Command aura will help its forces win the fight.

**Head Cracking Maul.** This is the saurian’s most damaging attack, and it will use it every turn, prioritizing spellcasters whenever it can.

**Puncturing Shield.** This attack is ideal against creatures with low strength and in situations where there aren’t too many enemies able to immediately make counterattacks against the saurian, so the loss of AC is manageable.

**Primal Command.** Because this aura suppresses the rampage condition, saurian within it will use their bite attacks as much as possible to try to score an extra bonus action bite without fear of succumbing to the effects of the rampage. 

**Tail Slam.** The knock-back from this attack makes it a useful escape tool or a way to push enemies apart to give other lizardmen a chance to gain better positioning.

### Saurian Loot
Because saurian are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Saurian Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Skinks

While they are the smallest and frailest of the lizardmen, skinks are the glue that holds their society together. The saurian know little other than war and combat, so it falls to the skinks to serve as administrators, artisans, and any other form of skilled labor required by their empire. That is not to say they serve no purpose in war. While skinks are physically weak and skittish compared to the rest of their kind, they are cunning and nimble creatures capable of filling many specialized roles.

***Warriors.*** Skinks' most common roles in combat are as mobile fighters who either ambush their foes or scamper into battle alongside larger allies. What they lack in brute force, they make up for with cunning tactics and poisonous weapons. These poisons are gathered from deadly jungle animals and used to debilitate foes in guerilla-style hit-and-run attacks. When fighting alongside larger creatures, skinks use these poisonous weapons to cripple their foes and make them easy prey for their deadly allies.

***Skirmishers.*** Many skinks are trained as scouts and skirmishers who specialize in stealth and the use of poisonous blowguns. Their foes rarely see them for more than a moment before they disappear into the jungle canopy to prepare another crippling attack. Often times these skink skirmishers are sent ahead of a larger force to sow disorder among their foes before the larger lizardmen force smashes into their vulnerable prey.

***Behemoth Keepers.*** One of the more specialized roles some skinks assume is that of beast keepers. These skinks tend to larger reptilian beasts of war and are known as behemoth keepers. The reptilian monsters they tend to must be raised from birth if there is to be any chance of controlling them with any modicum of safety. The skinks form a bond with the beast they rear, which serves them well in combat, turning them into a fighting force greater than the sum of its parts.

***Chieftains.*** Directing the skinks in day-to-day life as well as in combat are the chieftains. They are bolder than the typical skink and can drive their kind into a much more effective fighting force. A normally furtive and skittish group of skinks led by a chieftain can become a brutal strike force capable of rapidly bringing down foes typically outside their capabilities. The skink chieftains also serve as patrol leaders, heads of scouting parties, and battle coordinators for large lizardmen forces. They ensure battle plans are executed and pesky foes are eliminated as they conduct the war effort of the lizardmen army with brutal, calculating efficiency.

***Skink Priests.*** Though the mage priests are the highest-ranking members of their society, most of them spend too much time in isolated contemplation to effectively tend to the day-to-day operations of their civilization. This role is left to the skink priests, who serve as administrators and spiritual leaders to the lizardmen. Additionally, many skink priests are tasked with divining portents from many potential sources, whether they be celestial alignments, patterns in nature, or the murmurings of their mage priest masters. The priests use these portents to steer the course of their ancient civilization.

Though they possess a fraction of a mage priest's power, skink priests are still potent spellcasters, drawing on the power of the celestial heavens they study or the primal energies of their jungle home. When acting in the service of a mage priest, they can even serve as magical conduits for their master's power. They are also charged with operating the divine relics left behind by their gods, allowing them to unleash devastating power beyond their typical capabilities.

Priests who are in training or have failed to fully develop their powers nonetheless have some inate magical capabilities and can still serve as arcane vessels for their masters and, as such, are referred to as conduits.

### Skink Tactics

Skinks generally keep their distance from the enemies, using their superior land, climb, and swim speeds to stay out of melee range. They generally work to debuff foes, and combo well with more powerful creatures who attack head on.

#### Jungle Toxins
Skinks rely on this ability for their own defense, as poisoned players will have a harder time hitting them with attacks or spotting them while they’re hidden. As such, they will try to poison as many enemies as possible.

#### Primeval Mask
This ability is vital for skinks initiating combat as they will never start a fight without the backup of more powerful creatures unless they can do so from an ambush.

#### Skink Warriors
These skinks have the fewest options for weaving in and out of combat, and so will rely on poisoning targets from a distance before engaging in melee. They will not close the gap with enemies who aren’t poisoned or in some way disabled.

#### Skink Skirmisher
Because these skinks have blowguns and the ability to hide every turn using their vanish ability, they will never engage in melee combat unless cornered.

#### Skink Behemoth Keeper
These skinks are usually found atop the howdas of larger creatures and will always make use of their Beast Bond ability to enhance their mount.


#### Skink Chieftain
These skinks lead their kind in battle. They have a few noteworthy abilities:

##### Coordinating Javelin
Chieftains will use this ability to help other skinks quickly land a second javelin strike against a chosen target, thereby increasing the likelihood of it failing its saving throw against the Jungle Toxins.

##### Stalking Cohort
This ability allows groups of skinks to focus fire poisoned targets. The skinks can pop out from hiding, launch volleys of ranges attacks, and then disappear again, quickly whittling down poisoned players.


\columnbreak

### Skink Priest Tactics

In battle, skinks can serve as the main spell casters or as supporters to more powerful spellcasters. Their traits make them resistant to magic, but they are still vulnerable to weapon attacks. Skink priests need some form of cover, be it foliage or a larger creature, to shield them from these threats. If several skink priests assist a more powerful spellcaster, they should space themselves out. This strategy grants the more powerful caster leading them better control over the battlefield.

#### Skink Lore of Beasts Tactics
Skinks adept in the lore of beasts excel when paired with a skirmishing group of fellow skinks and/or a larger beast, ideally both. Here's how their spells are optimally employed:

**Pass Without Trace.** This spell should be cast preemptively. If a skink enters combat without having cast this spell and there are three or more allies capable of hiding as a bonus action, the skink will still cast it during combat.

**Wild Surge & Aspect of the Beast.** The skink's Wild Heart trait enhances the effects of these spells. They are best cast on the largest beast it's allied with. If a skink priest possesses both spells, it should target the same beast with both. This ensures the additional attack granted by Aspect of the Beast benefits from the damage boost of Wild Surge.

**Call of the Pack.** The skink will cast this spell if it sees an ally within 5 feet of an enemy. The extra action from the spell allows the skink priest to either Dash or Disengage to safety or opt to Hide if the situation demands it.

**Amber Spear.** The skink should use this spell when it can hit 3 targets (or 2 targets with low Dexterity).

#### Skink Lore of Heavens Tactics

These skinks do best when positioned at elevated vantage points, such as atop cliffs, tall trees, or riding on flying beasts. They specialize in countering flying creatures, always prioritizing them with their spells. Here's how their spells are optimally employed:

**Lightning Strike.** This spell is most effective when cast on two or more creatures. If the skink priest has exhausted its major spells, it will resort to using Lightning Strike on single targets, prioritizing creatures with the lowest Dexterity.

**Curse of the Midnight Wind.** Ideally, this should be the skink priest's opening spell, especially if it can affect three or more targets.

**Wind Blast.** This spell is versatile and can be used to push one or more enemies into the effects of an Ice Storm or Comet's Call that the skink has previously cast.

**Ice Storm.** This is best used as the skink's second spell, especially if it can affect three or more targets.

**Comet's Call.** This spell acts as a defensive mechanism. If the skink is trapped in melee combat, it can cast this to potentially deter attackers. By leveraging its Evasion trait and superior Dexterity saving throw, the skink can usually survive the comet's impact, whereas its assailants might suffer harsher effects. However, the skink will still attempt to move out of the impact zone if possible. The skink prioritizes casting this after Curse of the Midnight Wind and Ice Storm.

### Skink Loot
Because skinks are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skink Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Sload Mage-Priests
*Ancient Arcane Masters & Stewards of The Great Plan*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual <br>
Deep within the primeval jungles lie hidden temples from a bygone age, their enigmatic structures standing as relics of a lost era. At the heart of these strange edifices are vast chambers, where the air is thick with humidity and hums with sorcerous power. In the center of each chamber floats a massive, bloated creature of immense mystic might—surpassed only by the gods themselves. These spellcasters are the sload mage-priests: ancient, amphibian beings who manipulate magic as effortlessly as mortals breathe.

Seated upon golden palanquins that hover gently above the ground, sustained solely by their esoteric thoughts, these beings wield unparalleled arcane power. Their bulbous eyes perceive the strands of magic weaving through the world, and with elegant gestures of their multi-jointed fingers, they draw arcane energy to themselves like rivers rushing to the sea. With such vast magical reserves, a sload mage-priest can unleash spells of devastating magnitude—storms of fire that consume cities, entire armies turned to stone in a flash of light, or thoughts amplified into overwhelming cacophonies that shatter the minds of even the most astute wizards.

The powers of the sload mage-priests vary among their kind. Some wield terrifying defenses, ignoring blades and arrows as if they were illusions, while others are nearly unkillable, regenerating severed limbs and knitting gaping wounds within seconds. Certain mage-priests can silence enemy spellcasters with a mere gesture, unraveling incantations and rendering their magic impotent.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The sload are said to have been created by a race of godlike beings who sought to reshape the world according to their grand design. The sload were crafted to aid in this monumental undertaking. Guided by their divine makers, they shifted continents, altered planetary orbits, and nurtured species deemed worthy while purging those found unfit. But this great plan was never completed. A cataclysm—unwittingly triggered by the very designs of their creators—plunged the world into chaos. When the dust settled, the gods were gone, and the mightiest sload mage-priests—those with the deepest knowledge of the plan—had perished.

Those who remain are the last of their kind. Most dwell in their humid chambers in deep meditation, so profound that they might be mistaken for dead. In truth, their minds are anything but idle—they traverse time and space, contemplating the fragmented instructions left by their vanished masters. These trances can last lifetimes without interruption. When a sload mage-priest finally stirs, it is often because they believe they have uncovered a fragment of the great plan and now intend to act upon it.

Guarded by vast cohorts of lizardmen who revere them as living saints of the Old Gods, mage-priests command unwavering loyalty. When they proclaim what must be done to fulfill the divine vision, their cold-blooded followers act without hesitation. Whether these actions stem from true divine insight or a desperate search for purpose is irrelevant—when a sload mage-priest acts with conviction, few forces in the world can stand in their way.

### Disciplines of The Old Ones
A sload mage-priest can be granted any of the following traits to reflect its age and power. Younger mage-priests typically have one trait, while the eldest mage-priests may have as many as four. Each trait granted increases its CR by 2. 

#### Becalming Cogitation
The mage-priest can cast *Dampen Magic* at will.

#### Harrowing Scrutiny
At the start of the mage-priest’s turn, it unleashes an aura of otherworldly authority. Each hostile creature within 120 feet of it must succeed on a *DC 20 Wisdom Saving Throw.* <br>
*Failure.* The creature is Frightened until the start of the mage-priest’s next turn. While Frightened this way, the creature can cast only cantrips. <br>
*Failure by 10 or More.* The creature is Paralyzed while Frightened. <br>
*Success.* The creature becomes immune to Harrowing Scrutiny for 24 hours.

#### Harmonic Convergence
At the end of its turn, the mage-priest may begin a ritual drawing on the winds of magic. While the ritual is active, it has advantage on spell attack rolls, and creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against its spells. A creature within 15 feet can use an action or bonus action to make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disrupt the ritual.

*Failure.* The creature takes 22 (4d10) Force damage. <br>
*Failure by 5 or More.* The creature takes 33 (6d10) Force damage. <br>
*Success.* The ritual ends. <br>
*Success by 5 or More.* The ritual ends, and the creature channels some of the energy. The next spell of 1st level or higher it casts before the end of its next turn is cast as if using a slot 1 level higher.

#### Higher State of Consciousness
The mage-priest can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) Force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It has resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. If the mage-priest takes 30 or more damage from spells on a turn, it loses this trait until the start of its next turn.

#### Focus on Mystery
On initiative count 30 of the first round of combat (losing initiative ties), the mage-priest casts *storm of magic*. This casting doesn’t require concentration and ends only if the mage-priest chooses to end it or dies.


#### Soul of Stone
The mage-priest’s concentration on spells can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.


\columnbreak

#### Transcendent Healing
Choose one damage type other than Force. The mage-priest regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If the mage-priest takes 20 or more damage of the chosen damage type before its next turn, this regeneration doesn’t function on its next turn. The mage-priest only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

#### Unfathomable Presence
The mage-priest has resistance to damage from spells. If it takes 30 or more Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage on a turn, it loses this trait until the start of its next turn.

### Sload Mage-Priest Tactics
Sload mage-priests are powerful spellcasters who excel when supported by minions, allowing them to maintain distance while unleashing devastating spells or providing support to their allies. Their tactics vary based on their assigned Lore of Magic, with each lore granting four primary spells. If their enemies remain undefeated—or are not close to defeat—after expending these spells, mage-priests should retreat.

#### Lore of Beasts
Mage-priests of the Lore of Beasts excel when paired with a powerful creature (e.g., Carnosaur, Ancient Ceradon) that they can buff. Pre-battle preparation is critical.

* **Summon Stampede:** Cast before combat or on the first turn, targeting the largest enemy group.
* **Titanic Growth:** Cast before combat or on the second turn, using Wild Heart to enhance a powerful creature.
* **Amber Spear:** Cast while *Summon Stampede* and *Titanic Growth* are active, targeting low-Dexterity enemies.

### Sload Mage-Priest Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from sload mage-priests are the ancient relics they carry with them. However, some more macabre looters may harvest their remains for materials that hold some lingering power. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** checks. At the DM's discretion, harvesting their bodies can be done using an **Intelligence (Medicine)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Sload Mage-Priest Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## The Wanderer

In the expansive lore of the lizardmen, a figure of myth and legend emerges from the mists of time, known only as "The Wanderer." This ancient crox is a living testament to battles past and a beacon of hope for the lizardmen in their darkest hours. He roams the lands, appearing where he is needed most and leaving countless legends in his wake.

Among the Crox, The Wanderer stands unparalleled — taller, broader, and evidently older than any of his kin. His body is a canvas of ancient scars, each narrating a saga of valor and struggle. Rather than typical armors, he's adorned with ceremonial artifacts, tokens from grateful tribes and tributes to the gods. Some of these tokens are so deeply embedded that they seem hammered into his very scales, becoming a part of him.

In battle, The Wanderer is a force of nature. He wields a massive maul, its weight and power enough to cleave through multiple adversaries in a single swing. His primal roar, a testament to his age and vigor, has the power to send enemies scrambling in fear and uplift the spirits of allies. But it's not just his weapon that foes should fear; with jaws capable of crushing bone, claws sharp enough to rend armor, and a tail adept at tripping those who venture too close, he's the embodiment of natural ferocity.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



With every victory, The Wanderer doesn't just triumph over his adversaries, but he also wins the favor of the lizardmen deities. Each god values different facets of combat and nature, and through his myriad victories, The Wanderer touches upon each of their domains. Be it a fierce battle that pleases the god of storms, the hunt of a mighty monster that wins the respect of the god of beasts, or a saved lizardmen city that earns the smile of the goddess of protection, his actions resonate in the divine realms, cementing his status as their chosen champion.

Mysterious in his ways, The Wanderer has a knack for appearing when the lizardmen need him the most. At the brink of desolation, when all hope seems lost, his sudden emergence has turned the tide of many pivotal battles. With a natural instinct for leadership and strategy, he doesn't just fight; he leads the lizardmen, ensuring their survival and victory against overwhelming odds.

To the lizardmen, The Wanderer isn't just a warrior; he's a living legend, a spirit of the jungle, and an avatar of the gods. Every time he appears, they shower him with sacred relics, adding to his already vast collection of ceremonial adornments. These aren't mere gifts; they are tokens of reverence and sacrifice, symbolizing their deep devotion and dependence on the divine forces The Wanderer embodies.

Every creature of the wanderer's choice within 120 feet of it that can hear the roar must succeed a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute. Creatures frightened this way that end their turn 10 feet or more away from the wanderer can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Additionally, the wanderer and allies of its choice within 120 feet of it enter a rampage for one minute. While rampaging this way, their weapon attacks deal an additional 5 (1d10) damage.

### Epic Battle:<Br> Favor of the Old Ones
For a mythic encounter with The Wanderer, increase his hit points to 600 HP and enhance his Primal Roar trait with the following effects. His Challenge Rating (CR) increases to 23.
Primal Roar Modification: The Wanderer's Primal Roar trait changes such that it triggers three different times as his hit points drop to 450, 300, and 150 rather than only triggering once. The damage bonus granted to allies from each roar can stack, and a single instance of damage to The Wanderer can trigger multiple roars.

Each time Primal Roar is triggered, a unique set of effects occurs. These effects persist until The Wanderer is reduced to 0 hit points or 10 minutes has passed.

#### 1st Roar (450 HP): The God of Beasts
The Wanderer's roar summons a **razorsaur** in an unoccupied space it can see within 300 feet, subject to the following conditions:
* The summoned razorsaur has an initiative count of 20 and benefits from the effects of the roar that called it forth, including having the rampaging condition.
* This razorsaur remains for 10 minutes or until either it or The Wanderer are reduced to 0 hit points.
* Each subsequent use of The Wanderer's Primal Roar will summon another razorsaur in the same manner.

\columnbreak

#### 2nd Roar (300 HP): The God of Storms
The Wanderer's roar summons a tempest blows around The Wanderer (30 miles per hour) and moves with it, remaining centered on it. The tempest is up to 1 mile high with a diameter of 150 feet. The Wanderer can choose any number of creatures to be unaffected by the storm, but all other creatures suffer the following effects while in its area:
* The storm is difficult terrain for flying creatures.
* Ranged attacks that travel more than 30 feet through the storm automatically miss.
* On initiative count 20, every creature within the storm must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet toward its center.

#### 3rd Roar: The God of Protection
The Wanderer's roar creates a glowing 30-foot cube of shimmering magical protection centered on himself. He can choose any creatures within the area of the cube to be rendered immune to all forms of damage while they continue to be within it. The cube stays in one location and doesn't move with The Wanderer.

##### The Wanderer Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Wrath of The Wanderer:** In their travels, the players inadvertently anger a sect of lizardmen who view them as enemies of their god. The sect summons The Wanderer to quell the "threat" that the party supposedly poses.|
|  2  |**Jungle Plunder:** The players are visiting a jungle port town where many treasure hunters come to plunder the ruins within the mainland. The plundering soon awakens the ire of the lizardmen and their protector, The Wanderer. The players may join the treasure hunters to fight off the lizardmen and collect riches or aid the lizardmen in driving off the plunderers.|
|  3  |**The Imposter's Trick:** An imposter mimicking one of the players has grievously wronged The Wanderer or those he is charged with protecting. Mistaking the party for allies of the imposter, The Wanderer seeks them out for retribution. |
|  4  | **Primeval Clash:** The players come across The Wanderer in the deep jungle, where he is battling overwhelming numbers of giant beasts to earn favor with the gods. The players can aid him and attempt to earn his favor or stalk his exploits and try to scavenge for leftover loot in the aftermath.|

### The Wanderer Tactics 
The Wanderer excels in brutal melee combat. While formidable on his own, he becomes even more effective when supported by ranged creatures. These allies help compensate for his lack of long-range capabilities, and they work especially well together when the allies can benefit from The Wanderer's Hulking Protector feature.

\columnbreak

The Wanderer possesses an innate knack for battle tactics, akin to an animal's hunting instincts, and he can expertly maneuver both himself and his minions to target the most vulnerable foes.

When selecting from his attack options, you can make the following considerations:

**Mighty Swing.** This allows The Wanderer to use his maul to decimate the densest clusters of enemies on the battlefield.

**Vice-like Jaws.** This is effective against skirmishers like rogues and monks or ranged attackers. It prevents them from escaping, and The Wanderer can even move a grappled target into a cluster of enemies, setting them up for his devastating Mighty Swing.

**Raking Claw.** This attack is most effective against targets with low AC, ensuring that both claws hit their mark.

**Tail Trip.** Targets with low Strength are especially susceptible to this move and make for ideal targets.

#### Primal Roar
Once The Wanderer's Primal Roar ability triggers, all tactical considerations are cast aside in favor of pure bloodshed. However, he retains the capacity to utilize his legendary actions in the most tactically advantageous ways possible.


#### Mythic Encounter
The Wanderer's mythic battle presents a formidable challenge for a player party, demanding significant counterplay strategies.

For The Wanderer, there are few decisions to make. The primary tactical consideration involves positioning the razorsaurs upon their arrival. It's important to note that the newly-summoned razorsaur, in their rampaging state, will hurl spikes at the closest target. Ideally, they should be positioned to target ranged or flying attackers, which The Wanderer struggles to counter.

### The Wanderer Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Wanderer are the remains of the equipment he was using or valuables he was carrying. Though crox don't often collect these items themselves, other lizardmen often adorn them with bones, jewelry, and ornaments of precious metal for ceremonial purposes, and The Wanderer is decorated with the most sacred of these items. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Because a battle against The Wanderer will likely be a major turning point in the adventure, it will often be a good idea to include a treasure hoard of the appropriate level as loot in addition to what's listed here.

#### The Wanderer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
