# Lizardmen Compendium

The ancient and inscrutable lizardmen dwell within their jungle cities, constructed in ages past and dedicated to a now crumbling world order. What remains of this civilization serves as a reminder of the primordial powers that once shaped the land, and the lizardmen make full use of the ancient power they still have at their disposal. This power ranges from ancient relics left over from their golden age to mighty dinosaurs used as beasts of burden and living weapons.

The lizardmen themselves come in several subspecies, each with a dedicated role to serve within the larger empire. All of these lizardmen regard outsiders with suspicion, if not outright hostility, and some lizardmen will even form conquering armies determined to restore the old order.

The players are most likely to encounter the lizardmen when exploring in or near their jungle homes. The players may be attempting to traverse jungles, explore ruins, or acquire relics within the realm of the lizardmen, which will naturally lead to confrontations. Alternatively, the lizardmen may be marching out of their realm to impose the unfathomable will of their masters upon the world, which could lead to the players having to fend off their reptilian invasion.

## Running Lizardmen Encounters
The setting you're running your adventures in will help determine the background of these lizardmen and their lore. They may be the primordial cousins of the lizardfolk in other settings, or they may be the stewards of an ancient empire. They may be noble protectors against ancient, long-forgotten evils or heartless conquers that eliminate other species without remorse.

Regardless of the specifics, there are some commonalities that tie lizardmen together, each of which could lead to conflict with the players:
* **Ancient:** Lizardmen are a primordial race, and their civilization is older than that of most mortals. This leads to them living in ancient cities and possessing powerful and valuable relics, which could put them at odds with treasure-hunting players.
* **Instructable:** Lizardmen possess a cold-blooded psychology that seems alien to most other races. They rarely display recognizable emotions and carry out their actions in a way that often seems callous to others. This behavior can often lead to conflicts with other races that the players could be pulled into.

* **Primal:** Despite lacking humanoid emotions, lizardmen are closely tied to their bestial natures and prone to bouts of primal aggression. This primal nature allows them to easily bond with other reptilian creatures, such as dinosaurs, which they often use in battle. Should the players wander into their territory, they may quickly find themselves on the receiving end of lizardmen’s primal aggression. 
* **Devoted:** Despite their primal natures, lizardmen are prone to following orders from more powerful beings. They make for loyal and surprisingly orderly soldiers and will fight to the death for their cause. Should the players interfere with the plans of their masters, the lizardmen will show them no mercy.

### Lizardmen Motivations
The long-term motivations of the lizardmen almost always involve executing the great plan they believe their gods left for them to safeguard. This plan is meant to keep the world in order and guard against chaos. All other short-term goals are meant only to serve this greater plan. The only exceptions to this are when some of the lizardmen succumb to their more primeval natures and begin operating on base instinct. 

When role-playing lizardmen it’s usually best to keep their motivations both simple and difficult to read. When defending their territory or attacking those in possession of their relics, their motivations are as straightforward as a territorial animal’s. But when executing grand campaigns, they believe with further the great plan of their gods, their motivations may be indecipherable to outsiders. 

#### Common Lizardmen Motivations
* Destroy Intruders
* Protect or Reclaim Sacred Sites Artifacts
* Exterminate Members of Other Races Working Against the Great Plan (Whether They Know They Are Or Not)
* Collect Sacrifices for Their Ancient Gods
* Eliminate Otherworldly Forces of Chaos Entering the World
* Acquire Jungle Beasts for Labor and Wartime Use

> ##### The Rampaging Condition
> Many creatures in this document have abilities that cause them to enter a rampage. Rampages last for one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: <br>
> &#8226;  Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.<br>
> &#8226; The creature must take the Attack action on each of its turns, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see unless there are no creatures it can reach with an attack. <br>
> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>
> &#8226;  The creature can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

### Lizardmen Tactics
Lizardmen are highly resilient and resourceful combatants who combine primal aggression with instinctive tactical acumen. While each subspecies and the various dinosaurs they make use of all fight differently, there are some general commonalities:

***Melee Oriented.*** Lizardmen usually have better melee options than ranged options. Skinks are exceptions to this, but for most other lizardmen and their dinosaurs, it’s usually best to close into melee range with the players as quickly as possible.

***Mixed Forces.*** Lizardmen forces generally benefit from mixing nimble skinks in with mightier saurus and dinosaurs. The skinks can debilitate foes while their kin move in for the kill.

***Rampaging.*** Most lizardmen, other than skinks, will begin rampaging when they drop to a third of their HP or less and other some other special circumstances. This condition forces them to engage their closest enemies in melee combat and can be used against them by cunning players. However, some lizardmen abilities boost their combat potential while they’re rampaging, so some lizardmen may intentionally drive themselves into a rampage.

#### Engagement
How the lizardmen engage in combat will largely depend on whether they have skinks among their forces. Skinks are master ambushers and will usually try to catch players by surprise and put them on the back foot before directing their harder-hitting allies to close in. Lizardmen operating without skinks tend to be less stealthy and forgo the element of surprise to try to close in on the players as quickly as possible. That’s not to say they lack tactical nuance. Saurus warriors will still try to attack from optimal angles, surround foes, and pick off prime targets whenever possible.

#### Combat
In combat, lizardmen combine cold-blooded, brutal efficiency with primal ferocity. They execute orders they are given to a tee and are hyperfocused on their mission to the exclusion of almost all else. However, the targets of their wrath are subjected to animalistic brutality. When playing them, keep them focused on their objective and allow them to execute complex plans and make intelligent tactical decisions, but make sure any players they’re attacking feel like they’re being brutalized by an unrelenting beast.

#### Retreat
Lizardmen are utterly devoted to their cause, and most will fight to the death if it is in service to the great plan of their gods. This is not to say they are utterly unflappable. Skinks are skittish and may give in to their fear if the odds seem stacked heavily against them, causing them to scamper away from threats. Most other lizardmen struggle with the opposite instinct. When things start looking dire, they will enter a bloody rampage that leads to them fighting to the death, regardless of whether it's in the best interest of the lizardman force as a whole. 
Should the players retreat, most lizardmen will give chase if they have the strength to do so. They are remorseless and unforgiving by nature, and once they’ve marked prey for death, they rarely abandon their mission.

## Skinks

While they are the smallest and frailest of the lizardmen, skinks are the glue that holds their society together. The saurus know little other than war and combat, so it falls to the skinks to serve as administrators, artisans, and any other form of skilled labor required by their empire. That is not to say they serve no purpose in war. While skinks are physically weak and skittish compared to the rest of their kind, they are cunning and nimble creatures capable of filling many specialized roles.

Skinks' most common roles in combat are as mobile fighters who either ambush their foes or scamper into battle alongside larger allies. What they lack in brute force, they make up for with cunning tactics and poisonous weapons. These poisons are gathered from deadly jungle animals and used to debilitate foes in guerilla-style hit-and-run attacks. When fighting alongside larger creatures, skinks use these poisonous weapons to cripple their foes and make them easy prey for their deadly allies.

Many skinks are trained as scouts and skirmishers who specialize in stealth and the use of poisonous blowguns. Their foes rarely see them for more than a moment before they disappear into the jungle canopy to prepare another crippling attack. Often times these skink skirmishers are sent ahead of a larger force to sow disorder among their foes before the larger lizardmen force smashes into their vulnerable prey.

One of the more specialized roles some skinks assume is that of beast keepers. These skinks tend to larger reptilian beasts of war and are known as behemoth keepers. The reptilian monsters they tend to must be raised from birth if there is to be any chance of controlling them with any modicum of safety. The skinks form a bond with the beast they rear, which serves them well in combat, turning them into a fighting force greater than the sum of its parts. 

Directing the skinks in day-to-day life as well as in combat are the chieftains. They are bolder than the typical skink and can drive their kind into a much more effective fighting force. A normally furtive and skittish group of skinks led by a chieftain can become a brutal strike force capable of rapidly bringing down foes typically outside their capabilities. The skink chieftains also serve as patrol leaders, heads of scouting parties, and battle coordinators for large lizardmen forces. They ensure battle plans are executed and pesky foes are eliminated as they conduct the war effort of the lizardmen army with brutal, calculating efficiency.

### Skink Loot
Because skinks are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skink Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Skink Tactics

Skinks generally keep their distance from the enemies, using their superior land, climb, and swim speeds to stay out of melee range. They generally work to debuff foes, and combo well with more powerful creatures who attack head on.

#### Jungle Toxins
Skinks rely on this ability for their own defense, as poisoned players will have a harder time hitting them with attacks or spotting them while they’re hidden. As such, they will try to poison as many enemies as possible.

#### Mask of the Jungle
This ability is vital for skinks initiating combat as they will never start a fight without the backup of more powerful creatures unless they can do so from an ambush.

#### Skink Cohorts
These skinks have the fewest options for weaving in and out of combat, and so will rely on poisoning targets from a distance before engaging in melee. They will not close the gap with enemies who aren’t poisoned or in some way disabled.

#### Skink Skirmisher
Because these skinks have blowguns and the ability to hide every turn using their vanish ability, they will never engage in melee combat unless cornered.

#### Skink Behemoth Keeper
These skinks are usually found atop the howdas of larger creatures and will always make use of their Beast Bond ability to enhance their mount.

#### Skink Chieftain
These skinks lead their kind in battle. They have a few noteworthy abilities:

##### Coordinating Javelin
Chieftains will use this ability to help other skinks quickly land a second javelin strike against a chosen target, thereby increasing the likelihood of it failing its saving throw against the Jungle Toxins.

##### Stalking Cohort
This ability allows groups of skinks to focus fire poisoned targets. The skinks can pop out from hiding, launch volleys of ranges attacks, and then disappear again, quickly whittling down poisoned players.

## Saurus

Among the lizardmen civilization, the saurus are responsible for waging war and protecting their people. They are created for battle, emerging as fully formed adults from ancient spawning pools maintained by the lizardmen, ready to serve their purpose from the moment of their creation.

Though they don’t possess much in the way of standard intellectual prowess, saurus have an intuitive understanding of warfare and combat tactics, able to execute advanced tactical maneuvers that belie their slow-witted demeanor.

The suarus combine the features of dinosaur and man, lumbering across the battlefield clad in iron-hard scales with powerful jaws capable of tearing into even the most heavily armored foes. Beyond their natural armaments, saurus wield massive stone weaponry and shields crafted from the hides of giant jungle beasts. These physical advantages, combined with cold, ruthless discipline and intuitive tactical know-how, make even a single rank-and-file saurus warrior more than a match for the typical soldier of another race.


Though the saurus are created to be disciplined and resolute soldiers, they still possess a bestial savagery in their hearts that harkens back to their primal ancestry. Saurus pushed to their limits in battle will throw off the pretense of restraint and enter a rampage, tearing into the nearest enemies they see, heedless of danger or even their orders. 

### Sacred Spawnings

It is believed that the gods of the ancient lizardmen watch over every saurus spawning, guiding their civilization along the Great Plan laid for the world at the dawn of time. Occasionally, a spawning will result in a batch of saurus bearing distinct colorations and abilities. These are thought to be blessings of the Old Ones used to create specialized warriors capable of aiding the lizardmen in unique ways. Through these blessed saurus, the divine will of the Old Ones is carried out, and The Great Plan is actualized.

### Temple Guard
While there are many types of unique saurus spawnings that can arise depending on the needs of the Old Ones, one variant carries a special reverence. Saurus of this spawning are known as the temple guard, and they possess an iron resolve and dedication to duty beyond the rest of their kind. These saurus are made to protect their sacred charges. These charges are most often venerable mage-priests of the lizardmen, but some temple guard may be assigned to protect particularly revered relics and divine location. 

Temple guards don ancient bones and armaments and perform their duties with supernatural discipline. They can stand motionless for centuries at a time, watching for the slightest sign of danger. Should such danger arise, they spring to action without a moment’s hesitation, shielding their charge from harm while ruthlessly striking down any threat. 

Such is their discipline that temple guards can rarely be phased by circumstances that would break the will of most. Even the innate savagery of their kind is kept in check so as to ensure the protection of their charge.

The most elite among the temple guard are referred to as the chamber guardians. Their service is reserved for the most sacred of sites and most venerable of mage-priests. Their guardianship is unsurpassed, for they are never surprised and possess martial capabilities beyond that of any other saurus soldiers.

### Saurus Commanders
Though the saurus have little to no say in the day-to-day governance of the lizardmen, which is left to the skinks, or the grand, long-term plans of their civilization, which is directed by the mage-priests, the saurus are the masters of leading wartime efforts. Saurus have no known maximum lifespan and grow more powerful with age. Those who’ve endured for centuries accrue enough experience to become leaders among their kind and, thus, the principal commanders for the lizardmen as a whole. These battle-worn saurus are referred to as scar veterans. 

The centuries of hard-won wisdom scar veterens have accrued not only makes them more potent combatants but also gives them the skills necessary to direct their kin to maximum effect. While a saurus general leads the battle, he can curb the primal instincts of the beasts and lizardmen under his command. However, should the commander himself succumb to his primal instincts, the rampage of his fellow beasts and lizardmen will be all the more frenzied as they follow his savage example.

The most ancient saurus generals have survived millennia of warfare and come to be known as old bloods, the pinnacle of martial prowess and expertise amongst the lizardmen. Old bloods can control the forces of the lizardmen as though they’re extensions of their own body and execute intricate battle tactics as intuitively as they wield their ancient weapons. To face an old blood is to face a thousand years of martial mastery in the form of a single indomitable warrior.

### Blessings of the Old Ones
Some saurus warriors are spawned with enhanced abilities attributed to their ancient gods. These saurus's bear colorations that signify their specialized abilities and the unique ways they can serve their masters. You can apply one of these blessings to any of the saurus stat blocks described in this document. Doing so increases that saurus’s CR by 1. The saurus who most commonly have these blessings are saurus sacred spawn, scar veterans, and old bloods.

#### Blessing of the Beast God

*These lizardmen are marked with elaborate crests containing striking colors and possess an instinctive kinship with other beasts who possess the same primal instincts.*

If the saurus has a controlled mount with the Primal Instinct ability, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the saurus’s turns.

Additionally, while the saurus or the creature it is mounted on is rampaging, attacks of the saurus and the mount deal an additional 9 (2d8) damage on hit.

Finally, If the saurus is rampaging, it may choose not to move on its turn if it is mounted, even if this would prevent it from being able to attack.

#### Blessing of the Blood God

*These hyper-aggressive lizardmen are marked with blood-red scales and infused with a ferocity that drives them to slaughter in their god’s name.*

While the saurus is rampaging, its has advantage on attack rolls and deals additional 11 (2d10) damage on hit.

#### Blessing of the God of Fate

*These lizardmen are marked by the oldest of gods with pure white scales and are said to be destined for greatness as fate itself bends to their will.*

At the start of saurus’s turns, it can choose to be under the effects of the *foresight* spell until the end of its next turn.

Once the saurus uses this feature, it can't use it again until it finishes a long rest.

#### Blessing of the Hunter God

 *These saurus are marked with a brown spotted coloration to help them blend into the wilderness, and they possess superior predatory instincts that allow them to stalk prey through the thickest jungles.*

The Saurus has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage and may do so even if it is only lightly obscured. 

Additionally, the saurus has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. 

Finally, the saurus can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage,  or being grappled or restrained by them.

#### Blessing of the Protector God

*These lizardmen are marked with bony nobs and thick scales of a glittering silver color that deflect ranged attacks.*

While the saurus isn’t rampaging, when a creature 10 or more feet away from it hits it with an attack or deals damage to it with a spell, the damage is halved.

#### Blessing of the River God

*These aquatic lizardmen are marked with sea-green hues, gills, webbed claws, and crocodilian jaws they can use to drag their foes to a watery grave.* <br>
The saurus has a swim speed of 40 ft. and can breathe underwater.

When the saurus hits a creature with its bite attack, the target is grappled (escape DC equal to 8 + the Saurus’s Strength Modifier + Its Proficiency Bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the saurus can't bite another target.

#### Blessing of the Stoic God

*These saurus are marked with yellow lines down their body that signify their impassive nature and level-headedness during combat.*

The saurus adds +3 to its Wisdom, Charisma, and Intelligence saving throws and has resistance to psychic damage.

Additionally, its Primal Instinct feature is only triggered by it becoming charmed or frightened.

#### Blessing of the Sun God

*These energetic lizardmen are marked with the orange of the setting sun across their scales, and their sun god's power drives them to chase down their prey at alarming speeds.*

The saurus has advantage on intuitive rolls, and its speed is increased by 10 feet. If it would enter a rampage, it may use its reaction to move up to its speed toward any enemy it can see without provoking attacks of opportunity before its rampage begins.

#### Blessing of the Wind God

*These mystical lizardmen are marked with shimmering purple scales and possess primal wards that can sweep away enemy magics.*

The saurus can cast *counterspell* once per day without any components, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability. Its Primal Instinct ability is triggered when it casts the spell this way. (It can't cast the spell while rampaging.)

### Saurus Loot
Because Saurus are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Saurus Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Saurus Tactics
Saurus are direct and aggressive in their combat tactics and will usually fight to the death regardless of how dire their circumstances seem. They usually charge headlong into their foes, though they aren’t stupid about how they approach and won’t stumble into obvious traps or allow themselves to easily be put in a disadvantageous position. Saurus instinctively understand how to flank and outmaneuver foes, and they can usually pick out soft targets that need to be taken down first. 

Saurus are slightly stronger than other creatures at their CR because their Primal Instinct ability provides an exploitable weakness. As a DM, it’s important to communicate to the players when a saurus enters into a rampage what effect this appears to have on it. This way, clever players can use it to their advantage. 

#### Saurus Warriors
&emsp;**Bite.** Use this by default unless there is a commander ordering it not to. Because using bite has a chance to cause the saurus to rampage but also get another bite as a bonus action, the commander may order them to start using this attack if they are below 50 hit points and, therefore, close to rampaging anyway. Saurus will always use this in place of a shield attack if they’re rampaging.

**Maul.** Use this every turn as it is the most powerful attack.

**Shield.** Use this if a commander orders them to not use bites to avoid going into a rampage. Saurus won’t use this attack if they’re rampaging.

#### Saurus Sacred Spawn
These saurus follow mostly the same tactics as normal warriors. If they have blessings that work with the rampage condition, there may be more circumstances in which they use their bite to try and enter a rampage early.

#### Saurus Temple Guard
Temple guard, as their name implies, are designed to be bodyguards. They work especially well with spellcasters or other fragile ranged attackers. 

**Guardian’s Intervention.** Because this reaction reduces more damage if the saurus isn’t engaged in melee combat, temple guards will often stay near their charge rather than try to close in with players, even if they’re taking ranged fire.

**Sacred Duty.** It’s important to note this doesn’t stop Primal Instinct from triggering; it just suppresses the rampage condition while the temple guard is near its charge. Keep the guard close to its charge if you don’t want it running off after the nearest enemy.

#### Saurus Scar Veterens and Old Bloods
While under the control of a saurus commander, other saurus will be much more tactical in how they attack and use their abilities. Saurus commanders have the following abilities they can use to influence the battle:

**Bite.** Because the saurus rolls 2d6 for damage, there is a much higher chance of this attack causing it to enter a rampage. The saurus will avoid using this attack unless it believes entering a rampage for the extra damage from its Primal Command aura will help its forces win the fight.

**Head Cracking Maul.** This is the saurus’s most damaging attack, and it will use it every turn, prioritizing spellcasters whenever it can.

**Puncturing Shield.** This attack is ideal against creatures with low strength and in situations where there aren’t too many enemies able to immediately make counterattacks against the saurus, so the loss of AC is manageable.

**Primal Command.** Because this aura suppresses the rampage condition, saurus within it will use their bite attacks as much as possible to try to score an extra bonus action bite without fear of succumbing to the effects of the rampage. 

**Tail Slam.** The knock-back from this attack makes it a useful escape tool or a way to push enemies apart to give other lizardmen a chance to gain better positioning.

## Cold Ones

These large raptors roam far and wide in large, rapacious packs tearing apart any warm-blooded creatures they come across. Cold ones are known for their wild blood lust, vicious weaponry, and propensity for hunting in packs to bring down much larger prey.

 Their sheer aggression is among their most dangerous traits, for wounded cold ones do not flee but instead, become more recklessly aggressive. Even attempts to pacify or frighten a cold one with magic will simply make it wilder and angrier.

Cold ones are extremely simple-minded, even by dinosaur standards. Though they have an instinctive ability to hunt in packs, their ability to assess complex situations and execute appropriate strategies is severely limited. Most cold ones will pursue prey headless of any danger which presents itself.

Despite their limited intelligence and aggressive natures, cold ones can be successfully broken into mounts at scale. Because their territories range across many climates, they have been adopted for military use by multiple races. However, the lizardmen, who share their primordial jungle homes with the cold ones, were the first to do so. Many of their saurus warriors are spawned with blessings that grant them a natural kinship with wild reptilian beasts and lend them to being natural cavalry fighters atop the vicious cold ones. These mounted warriors make for devastating shock cavalry capable of running down and ripping apart even the hardiest of foes. 



### Horned Ones
These extremely rare raptors are thought to be near-extinct relatives of the cold ones. They are only found deep in the primeval jungles where the lizardmen also make their home. Horned ones don’t roam as far and wide as cold ones and instead guard specific stretches of jungle they regard as their territory. Though horned ones are significantly more intelligent than cold ones, they are extremely protective of their turf and will fight to the death when attacking any intruders. As their name suggests, they are armed with boney horns, which they use to ram prey before finishing the kill with claws and teeth.

Horned ones are prized mounts among the lizardmen. Their rarity, intelligence, and enhanced weaponry means they are ridden by only the most elite saurus soldiers and their generals. In battle, horned one riders are implacable cavalry warriors, bowling down foes without giving an inch of ground.

##### Cold One Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |The players have been charged with venturing into a cold one nest to retrieve eggs.|
|  2  |A wizard has resurrected a pack of long-dead cold ones, which have broken free and now roam his lab. |
|  3  |The players have been tasked with capturing cold ones to use as mounts. However, they soon find themselves in competition with lizardmen hunters.    |
|  4  |A cohort of lizardmen cold one cavalry is moving through the countryside near their jungle home, sacking every minor warmblood settlement they find.|
|  5  |While lost in a deep jungle, the players find what appears to be a clear path out. The only catch is that it runs through horned one territory.   |
|  6  | A saurus commander has gained control of a horned one which he now uses as his savage steed to lead a lizardmen crusade against the other warmblooded races.    |

### Cold One Loot
The valuable items looted from cold ones will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cold one.

#### Cold One Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Cold One Tactics

Cold ones are hyper-aggressive and have very low intelligence. Outside of making use of their Pack Tactics ability whenever possible, they don’t have any sophisticated combat tactics. They will simply try to gang up on and bring down the weakest prey they can spot. Allow them to fall for most ploys the party attempts, and let the players use their stupidity against them.

When used as mounts, their tactics will reflect that of the rider. However, the optimal strategy will still usually be to run down and gang up on vulnerable targets while hoping the cold one doesn’t rapamge in the process.

#### Horned Ones

This variant should be played more intelligently and not fall for obvious ploys the same way cold ones would. 

**Charge + Pact Tactics.** Whenever possible, horned ones should use their Charge ability to target an enemy who has an ally within 5 feet of it, so they can combine it with their Pact Tactics. If they are mounted, this will be a non-issue.

## Dread Saurian
These primeval titans are among the most feared <br> and powerful creatures that inhabit the jungles and <br> ruins of the lizardmen’s homeland. They are colossal quadrupedal, reptilian beasts, standing taller than even <br> the largest sauropods, and are protected by massive, armoured plates inscribed with ancient prophecies. 

Dread saurians are revered as sacred beasts by the lizardmen, who keep them in mountainous temples where they receive offerings and sacrifices from skink priests. They are among the most valuable assets of the lizardmen army, as their ferocity and near-indestructibility make them devastating foes.


In the battlefield, the dread saurian can charge into enemy lines, crushing and trampling any foes in its path, and its powerful tail can sweep away entire squads of soldiers in a single stroke. Most deadly of all are its colossal, crocodilian jaws, capable of crushing and tearing the most formidable of foes into bloody shreds.

***Skink Handlers and Howdahs.*** The dread saurian is often accompanied by skink handlers who can direct its attacks and use their own abilities to bolster its strength or weaken its enemies. These handlers can also provide healing and support to keep the creature fighting even in the face of overwhelming odds.

The skinks often direct the dread saurian from armored fortifications attached to its back, known as howdahs. They provide vital protection to the skink riders and are equipped with a variety of weapons, such as ballistae and giant blowpipes, which can be used to eliminate foes out of the dread saurian’s reach.

In addition to its combat capabilities, the dread saurian’s howdah is also used by the lizardmen as a means of transport. The howdah can carry additional supplies and equipment, making it an essential asset for military campaigns in the dense jungles of the lizardmen's homeland.

> ***Primal Instinct (104 HP, Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the dread saurian’s hit points drop to 104 or lower, or it becomes charmed or frightened, it enters a rampage that lasts for one minute.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The dread saurian can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes a claw attack against any number of targets in a 10-foot-long and 20-foot-wide area that emanates from the dread saurian in a direction of its choice. It can replace one of the attacks with Bite or Crushing Jaws. It can then immediately make a tail attack against any number of targets in a 30-foot-long and 20-foot-wide area that emanates from the dread saurian in the opposite direction of its claw attacks. The dread saurian can't move between attacks.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 41 (5d12 + 9) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 23). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the dread saurian can't bite another target.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not grappled by the dread saurian. *Hit:* 23 (4d8 + 9) slashing damage.
>
> ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target not grappled by the dread saurian. *Hit:* 23 (4d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ***Crushing Jaws.*** If the dread saurian has a target grappled with its bite attack, that target must make a DC 23 Strength saving throw or take 74 (10d12 + 9) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 13), the damage is doubled. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it dies.
>
>  ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the dread saurian’s choice that is within 120 feet of the dread saurian and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dread saurian’s Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Obliterating Charge.*** The dread saurian moves up to 50 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature. The first time it enters a creature's space during this move, it may make a claw attack against that creature.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Wounded Charge.*** When the dread saurian's hit points drop to 0 or it triggers its Primal Instinct ability, it can use its Obliterating Charge action. After using this action, the dread saurian dies if its hit points are 0.

***Artifacts of the Old Ones.*** Dread saurians are often equipped with ancient relics believed to have been left behind by the inscrutable gods of the lizardmen. These artifacts are embedded in the dread saurian by its skink handlers and grant it arcane powers it can access at will. They may grant the dread saurian extra resilience, summon the spirits of dead warriors, or even allow it to channel the sun's energy through its body. When the divine powers of these artifacts are combined with the dread saurian’s primal might, it becomes a nigh unstoppable force of nature.

Dread saurians equipped with these artifacts are considered avatars of the Old Ones' will. They are revered and protected by the lizardmen, not that they need much in the way of protection. Occasionally, particularly bold or mad relic seekers will attempt to hunt down these dread saurians and pry the artifacts from their grasp. Such attempts nearly always end in disaster for the would-be treasure hunters.

\columnbreak

***The Dread Shredder.*** This dread saurian is believed to be the oldest and mightiest of its kind in existence. Its title stems from its record of shredding through any foe that has been foolish enough to stand against it. With its devastating natural weapons and near-limitless vitality, the Dread Shredder has singlehandedly shattered armies and leveled forts.

The Dread Shredder is thought to have walked the world since the time of the Old Ones, and the lizardmen revere it as a demi-god. In times of dire need, they will equip it with artifacts of the Old Ones and a war howdah crewed by only the worthiest of skinks. Despite its limited intelligence, the Dread Shredder possesses a near-supernatural aura of authority, and other lizardmen and jungle beasts will naturally flock to its side when it lumbers into battle.

### Dread Saurian Artifacts

The dread saurian can be equipped with a magical artifact that grants it additional abilities and increases its CR by 2.

#### Spirit Eye

*A mystic crystal is embedded in the dread saurian, which allows it to call forth primal warriors from ages past.*

At the start of its turn, the dread saurian can summon three specters in unoccupied spaces within 90 feet of it. The specters act immediately after the dread saurian on the same initiative count and fight until they are destroyed. They disappear after 1 minute or when the dread saurian dies. The specters summoned with this ability have the following changes:
* They are not affected by Sunlight Sensitivity.
* They have a melee spell attack instead of Life Drain. The attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and targets one creature. On a hit, the attack deals 10 (3d6) force damage


#### Heart of Stone

*A large, eldritch stone is fused into the back of the dread saurian. The dread saurian can use the stone to draw the power of the earth into its body and become as unyielding as a mountain.*

At the end of the dread saurian's turn, if it has not moved on that turn and is standing on earth or stone, it gains a +3 bonus to AC, saving throws, and opposed checks. This ability can stack up to two times. The dread saurian loses all stacks if it moves or is forced to move.

While equipped with this artifact, the dread saurian's Primal Instinct ability is triggered only by it becoming charmed or frightened.

\columnbreak

#### Mantle of the Blazing Dawn 

*Strange golden patterns are etched across the dread saurian’s scales. As the beast charges, the markings flare and burn with divine radiance.*

Claw attacks made by the dread saurian when using its Obliterating Charge ability deal an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage and 10 (3d6) radiant damage on hit.


#### Primal Jaws

*The dread saurian’s teeth are etched with runes and gilded with rare metal to honor the most ancient of bestial gods. When the dread suarian crushes foes with its sacred jaws, it awakens a primal vigor in its allies.*

When the dread saurian uses its Crushing Jaws on a hostile creature, it and each ally within 100 feet of it gain 20 temporary hit points for the next minute. If the creature fails the saving throw against Crushing Jaws, they each gain 30 temporary hit points instead. If it fails by 10 or more, they each gain 40 temporary hit points instead.

#### Rebus of the Jungle

*Stange, magical, light-bending vines grow across the dread saurian and help mask its presence. These plants also help it to move through dense undergrowth undetected by its prey.*   

The dread saurian gets +11 to stealth checks and can move though plants without being slowed, taking damage, being grappled or restrained.

While dread saurian is lightly obscured, it is invisible to any creatures more then 10 feet away form it. If the dread saurian has a Howdah, the Howdah and the  Creatures inside of it gain this benefit as well

#### Figures of Dread

*The dread saurian wears a massive headdress lined with menacing statues, amplifying its already terrifying nature such that none can look upon it without experiencing mortal terror.*

The following ability replaces the dread saurian’s Frightful Presence:

 ***Dread Presence.*** Each creature of the dread saurian's choice within 120 feet that is aware of it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. All creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw unless they are within 5 feet of an ally. Creatures normally immune to being frightened can still be affected, but have advantage on their saves. While frightened, the creature can only use its actions to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or steel its resolve. A creature that uses its action to steel its resolve can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the dread saurian's Dread Presence for the next 24 hours.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Howdahs

You can choose to equip a dread saurian with a small, armored fort on its back known as a howdah. This howdah is a magic object with 100 hit points and an AC 19. Up to 10 Medium or smaller creatures can ride in the howdah without squeezing. All creatures within the howdah count as being within 5 feet of each other. Equipping a dread saurian with a howdah increases its CR by 1. 

**Entering the Howdah.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the dread saurian is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the dread saurian succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah until the start of its next turn, and any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted. The dread saurian may then immediately make an opportunity attack against the creature. If the dread saurian fails, the creature enters the howdah.

**Melee Attacks Against Creatures Within The Howdah.** To make a melee attack against a target in the howdah while outside of it, a creature must be within 5 feet of the dread saurian, and if the creature isn’t Huge or larger, the attack must have a reach of at least 20 feet.

**Protective Effects** When creatures are in the howdah, they are protected by powerful wards. They have three-quarters cover against attacks and effects from outside of it and a +5 bonus to all saving throws, not just Dexterity saves. If a creature in the howdah is subjected to an effect from outside that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half damage if it fails.

**Being Knocked Prone** If the dread saurian is knocked prone, the howdah takes 30 bludgeoning damage.

**Teleporting.** If the dread saurian is teleported, the howdah is teleported with it. Creatures in the howdah may choose to teleport with the dread saurian.

**Destruction.** If the dread saurian dies, the howdah is destroyed. When the howdah is destroyed, creatures that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the dread saurian.


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> ##### Jungle Toxins
> At the end of the turn, each creature hit by one or more weapons that inflict Jungle Toxins must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that has been hit by two or more attacks from weapons with Jungle Toxins this turn makes the saving throw with disadvantage. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success or taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failure.

#### Howdah Weapons

The howdah has built-in weapons that can be fired by the creature's within. Each weapon can only be fired once per turn. For every giant bow or giant blowpipe you equip the howdah with, increase the dread saurian's CR by 1.

##### Ballista

When using a giant bow, it takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. The creature aiming the weapon chooses the target and must also be the one to fire it. When fired, the arrow flies in a straight line up to 480 feet in a direction of the user's choice before falling to the ground.

If the arrow would strike a target, the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if the arrow has flown 120 feet or more. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or destroyed, the bolt keeps flying and deals 11 (2d10) less damage if it hits another target. Otherwise, the arrow's flight ends early.


##### Giant Blowpipe

When using a giant blowpipe, it takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. The creature aiming the weapon must be the one to fire it. When fired, it does the following:

Darts rain down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot radius centered on the point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (5d4) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, and makes the saving throw at the end of its turn against the poison with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, but does not have disadvantage on the saving throw at the end of its turn against the poison.

### Dread Saurian Loot
The valuable items looted from dread saurians will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them and whatever sacred items they’ve been adorned with. Harvesting a dread saurian’s body can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. Looting their adornments will usually involve an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest its hide.

Players should be able to do both forms of harvesting at once using separate checks for most dread saurians. 

If a dread saurian is equipped with an artifact, you can make a second roll for adornment loot. Alternatively, the players may recover a functional magic item from the artifact.


#### Dread Saurian Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.

### Dread Saurian Tactics
Dread Saurians are extremely belligerent and consistently seek to attack the largest group of enemies to inflict the most damage possible. They rarely consider going after the weakest targets. Their belligerence is so extreme that dread saurians will usually fight to the death, rampaging to the very end.

#### Dread Saurian Shredder Tactics
The only real difference in tactics with a dread saurian shredder involves its legendary actions, which are used in the following circumstances:

* **Swat.** This is used when dread saurian has a creature in its mouth, and another creature is causing a large amount of damage that it wishes to be rid of.
* **Mangle.** If the dread saurian doesn't have any creature in its mouth and is attempting to catch fleeing prey, it will usually use this after using an obliterating charge.
* **Gnaw.** The dread saurian will use this action whenever possible, unless under the effects of a debilitating condition where it needs to use Tenacious Will.
* **Obliterating Charge.** The dread saurian uses this action to catch up with fleeing prey.

#### Dread Saurian Howdah Tactics
Dread saurians on their own are generally not a significant threat to high-level parties as their dimwitted tactics and basic attacks can usually be countered by the many options players have at those levels. However, a howdah allows dread saurians to be directed by intelligent creatures and should be filled with riders equipped with ranged attacks to create a more well-rounded threat.

The creatures in the howdah do not have to be tough, as the +5 to all saving throws, AC from cover, and damage reduction mean that the crew is well-defended as long as they stay within the structure. Their job should be to eliminate targets the dread saurian cannot reach.

#### Dread Saurian Artifact Tactics
Dread Saurian upgrades can allow it to present a higher-level and more complex challenge. Here are some basic tactics for several upgrades:
* **Spirit Eye.** This is similar to the howdah in that it compensates for the dread saurian’s weakness to ranged attacks and flying creatures. The summoned spirits can disrupt enemies the dread saurian can’t reach, and their intelligence allows them to do this in tactical ways that support the dread saurian.
* **Heart of Stone.** With this upgrade, it’s best to grab one target and chew it relentlessly, only moving if there’s no one left to attack. It works well in combination with a howdah.
* **Mantle of the Blazing Dawn** With this upgrade, the dread saurian should make an obliterating charge whenever it can hit three or more targets.
* **Jaws of the Savage** This upgrade works well in combination with a howdah or other minions.
* **Rebus of the Jungle** This upgrade allows the dread saurian to behave more like an ambush predator. When it’s not rampaging, the dread saurian’s strategy should be to lure targets into underbrush and darkness.
* **Figures of Dread** This upgrade does little to change the dread saurian’s tactics.
