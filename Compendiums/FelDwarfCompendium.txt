# Fel Dwarf Compendium

These tyrants are a malevolent and brutal race of dwarves whose souls have been twisted by dark forces, transforming them into ruthless beings driven by greed and a desire for dominion. Unlike their noble kin, they have wholly embraced the fiendish energies that permeate their existence, using these arcane powers to reshape their bodies and minds in pursuit of their sinister goals. The fel dwarves' descent into darkness is marked not only by their wicked actions, but also by their grotesque appearance, with blackened, gnarled features and twisted, horn-like protrusions that serve as a constant reminder of their fall from grace.

In the varied worlds that they inhabit, fel dwarves are often found dwelling in the deepest, most inhospitable regions, where they construct formidable citadels and forge sinister alliances with other denizens of darkness. Fueled by their insatiable ambition, they engage in relentless conquests, enslaving the weak and crushing those who dare to defy their will. Their society is structured around an ironclad hierarchy, with the most powerful sorcerer-priests at its apex, guiding their kin with an unyielding grip. Fel dwarves possess a unique blend of potent magic and technological prowess, making them a formidable force to be reckoned with on any battlefield.


## Running Fel Dwarf Encounters
The setting you’re running your adventures in will help determine the background of this dwarven race and the specifics of their lore. In some settings, they may be twisted by the forces of fel into malevolent beings. If your setting has a cosmology aligned with more classical D&D settings, these dwarves will likely align themselves with devils, given that they share a lawful evil and tyrannical nature. 

### Fel Dwarf Motivations and Adventure Setups

Regardless of the lore and setting specifics, these dwarves are defined by their conquering industrialist nature. Players could encounter and come into conflict with fel dwarves under many types of circumstances. You can use the table on the next page as inspiration for ways to introduce fel dwarves into your campaign:

|   |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  7  | **Intrigue and Subterfuge:** Fel dwarves are cunning and manipulative, and they may infiltrate other societies to further their nefarious goals. Players might be tasked with unmasking a fel dwarf spy or uncovering a plot to destabilize a city or kingdom.
|  8  | **Ancient Grudges:** Many fel dwarves bear long-standing grudges against their noble kin, and they may actively seek to undermine or destroy dwarven settlements or interests. Players aligned with dwarven factions may be called upon to defend against fel dwarf incursions or sabotage. |

### Roleplaying Fel Dwarves

Fel dwarves are ambitious power seekers, always looking to advance themselves above others. They view other races with contempt, seeing their kind as superior to all others. Fel dwarves meeting the players will either see them as a means to an end or as obstacles to be destroyed. They may be willing to trade with the players, but if the players are aligned with forces opposed to the interest of the fel dwarves or their masters, they will likely turn on the players before long.  

Consider these traits when playing on the decisions and behavior of fel dwarves. They are not reckless barbarians, but calculating tyrants, always looking for that chance to further their machinations, enhance their wealth, or advance in power. That said, they still value loyalty to their masters, and though they scheme and plot their way up through their hierarchies, fel dwarves will carry out their assigned duties without question. For it is through this loyalty and cold, calculating devotion they hope to advance in power.

### Fel Dwarf Tactics
In combat, fel dwarves are stubborn, brutal, and capable of executing complex tactics utilizing a mix of different units. The fel dwarf forces can include many types of soldiers, machines, and creatures, but there are tactical trends that can be found through most of their kind:

***Low Mobility.*** Like most dwarven forces, fel dwarves fight best when they can force their enemies to come to them. They often make use of monsters and more mobile soldiers of other races to compensate for their lack of speed. Still, even these forces perform best when attacking foes already tangled up in combat with the elite fel dwarf soldiers.

***Heavy Firepower.*** Like many of their dwarven kin, fel dwarves are master crafters and engineers. They create advanced firearms and artillery weapons imbued with fiendish power, which they bring to bare on their foes whenever possible.

***Mixed Forces.*** Between their heavy infantry, masses of expendable laborers, mobile creatures, menacing monsters, diabolic magic, and technically advanced firearms and war machines, fel dwarves have a multitude of options at their disposal. And they excel at combining these forces in ways that offset their weaknesses.

***Enslavers.*** Fel dwarf society runs on the back of forced labor, and they are always in need of more workers. Fel dwarves avoid killing enemies in combat when it can feasibly be avoided. Defeated foes are transported back to the nearest fel dwarf settlement, where they are quickly put to work.

***Heartless Discipline.*** Fel dwarves possess the same level of resolve as their uncorrupted kin and will carry out battle plans to a tee, even putting themselves in danger to do so. To do anything less is considered a sign of weakness, and there is nothing fel dwarves despise more than weakness.

\columnbreak

#### Engagement
Dwarves prefer to force their enemies to engage them. They will attempt to bombard foes with superior firepower to force an approach. Ideally, this allows the heavy dwarven infantry to engage their foes without needing to move to make the engagement themselves. This means of combat initiation is rarely subtle, and fel dwarves typically do not attempt to sneak up on their enemies unless they’re utilizing stealthier minions of other races.

#### Combat
In battle, fel dwarves seek to outlast their foes with durable creatures or masses of laborers while brutally breaking them into submission through superior firepower. They seek to establish a superior position in battle from which they can withstand any attacks while laying waste to their foes. What position they take and how they bring down their foes will depend on the creatures and weapons the fel dwarves have at their disposal. They rarely fight with only one type of creature and usually rely on mixing strategies to offset exploitable weaknesses.

#### Retreat
Fel dwarves are stubborn, but they aren’t stupid. If they see that their strategy has been countered, they may retreat to regroup and gather what they need to overcome their foes. If fel dwarves suffer heavy losses, they will retreat to a more defensible position while calling for backup. 
If their enemies are retreating, the fel dwarves will pursue them whenever possible, as defeated and fleeing foes present a prime opportunity for rounding up new laborers.

## New Weapons
Fel dwarves are known for their wicked ingenuity and have invented destructive firearms beyond the capabilities of most other races. The following firearm weapons are used by some of the fel dwarf infantry described later and can be made available to players at the DM’s discretion. 

***Blunderbuss.*** Crafted in the dark forges of the fel dwarves, blunderbusses are marvels of dark engineering, combining the dwarven knack for craftsmanship with cruel, destructive intent. Larger and more potent than the firearms wielded by their kin, these weapons are loaded with a lethal mix of shot, black powder, and arcane substances. When fired, they unleash devastating projectiles capable of decimating enemy ranks and piercing the strongest armor.

***Fire Glaive.*** These infernal weapons combine the melee capabilities of a traditional glaive with a rifle capable of shooting flaming projectiles. Fire glaives are rare and expensive to produce and, as such, are only used by the most elite fel dwarf soldiers. Soldiers utilizing these weapons are able to act as hybrid warriors, alternating between melee and ranged combat depending on the needs of the battle.

#### Blunderbuss
*ranged weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 3d10
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Ammunition (range 80/320), reload (1), heavy, two-handed
- **Cost:** 75 gp
- **Weight:** 18 lb.

\columnbreak

<br><br>



#### Fire Glaive
*melee weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d10
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, reach, reload (1), two-handed, special
- **Cost:** 125 gp
- **Weight:** 18 lb
___

### New Weapon Properties 
&emsp;**Fire Glaive.** This weapon can be used to make ranged attacks that use its ammunition property. Attacks made this way deal an additional 1d10 fire damage on hit.

**Reload (X).**  This weapon can be fired X times before it must be reloaded using an action or in place of an attack that's part of an attack action or in place of an off-hand attack while duel wielding. The weapon can be reloaded early without losing any ammunition.

## Fel Dwarf Soldiers

These soldiers are hardened, relentless warriors who form the backbone of the fel dwarf armies, carrying out the will of their dark masters with brutal efficiency. They are twisted fighters shaped by the same dark energies that have corrupted the rest of their kin, making them formidable and ruthless combatants. Clad in sinister armor and wielding weapons crafted from the darkest depths of their infernal forges, fel dwarf soldiers are a diabolic force capable of dominating nearly any foe they face.

On the battlefield, fel dwarves share the stubborn determination of their uncorrupted kin and can adopt resolute stances, allowing them to focus their entire being on withstanding the onslaught of their enemies. This unwavering resolve grants them an uncanny ability to shrug off most attacks and maintain their position, even under the fiercest assaults. However, this defensive posture comes at a cost, as it slows their movement and makes them vulnerable to attacks that require nimbleness to avoid.

The fel dwarf military forces are also known for their debilitating strikes that leave their enemies reeling from the sheer force of their blows. Even if their foes manage to regain their footing, the lingering effects of the strike leave them stunned and vulnerable. This combat technique is vital to the fel dwarves as it allows them to defeat their foes while leaving them alive for capture and enslavement.

> ##### Dwarves with Polarms
> Though dwarves in many fantasy settings traditionally use axes in combat, halberds, and other polearms weapons better complement the tactics dwarves use. Otherwise, they are vulnerable to foes who use reach weapons against them. If you wish to give the dwarves more well-rounded tactical options, you can replace their battle axes with halberds and replace their ***Shield Fighter*** trait with the following trait (only do this for dwarves with shields):<Br>
***Halberd Master.***  The dwarf can wield a halberd in one hand and a shield in the other.

<br>

Overall, these soldiers possess an array of combat skills and abilities that complement each other in combat. Some soldiers specialize in melee combat, wielding wicked axes, maces, or hammers with ruthless precision. Others excel at ranged combat, employing devastating firearms that can lay waste to their enemies from afar. Together they can form nearly unassailable military forces capable of laying waste to any who stand in the way of their implacable march towards conquest.

### Fel Dwarf Warriors

These soldiers are the mainstay of their armies, displaying unwavering loyalty and fierce determination in battle. They are often found on the front lines of fel dwarf forces, ready to face any foe with their cruel battleaxes and sturdy shields. The ring mail they don provides ample protection, while their shields are adorned with dread symbols of their dark allegiance. Like the warriors of their uncorrupted kin, they combine these masterfully crafted armaments with unyielding discipline to become a fighting force to be reckoned with.

Despite being among the lowest-ranking dwarven soldiers in their armies, compared to the warriors of other races, these fel dwarves are still elite infantry. However, their combat prowess is offset by the relatively small population of their race. As such, fel dwarf warriors cannot be fielded in the same numbers as warriors of other races and must often rely on a mass fodder force of indentured soldiers to fill out their numbers. Because of this constant need for more cannon fodder, fel dwarf warriors often engage in raids to capture and conscript new soldiers for their army.

***Burning Beard Warriors.*** These fiery warriors are a rare and fearsome sect of battle-hardened fighters who have delved deep into the secrets of flame, harnessing its destructive power to rain havoc upon their enemies. They are easily recognized by their brass armaments and flaming hair and beards. The burning beards are specialized warriors often found in the ranks of the more ruthless and aggressive dwarf factions, using their mastery of flame to demoralize and devastate their foes.

Their prowess in battle is exemplified by their flaming battleaxes, which emit a searing heat that intensifies when either their target or the warrior is engulfed in flames. This fearsome power can turn the tide of battle as their foes are consumed by the relentless inferno.

When burning beard warriors are able to focus their fury in combat, it manifests as a surge of intense heat that erupts from their very being, igniting any who dare approach. The resulting firestorm serves as a potent deterrent to those who would dare to approach these formidable warriors.

Staying out of range of their attacks proves futile, for most of these dwarves are armed with sinister incendiary devices, which they hurl into crowds of enemies unleashing a devastating inferno that can turn the tide of battle in an instant.

On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and ignites in flames (as described in Burning Resolve). On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't ignite. <br>

### Fel Dwarf Blunderbussiers
Fel dwarf blunderbussiers are a terrifying <br> sight to behold on the battlefield. Known for their <br> distinctive, oversized firearms, these formidable <br> warriors unleash devastating volleys of fire and <br> shrapnel upon their enemies, their blunderbusses <br> roaring with the force of a miniature artillery <br> barrage.

Crafted in the dark forges of the fel <br> dwarves, these blunderbusses are marvels of <br> dark engineering, combining the dwarven <br> knack for craftsmanship with a cruel, destructive <br> intent. Larger and more potent than the firearms <br> wielded by their kin, these weapons are loaded <br> with a lethal mix of shot, black powder, and <br> arcane substances. When fired, they unleash a <br> devastating cone of destruction, capable of <br> decimating enemy ranks and piercing the <br> strongest armor.

In battle, the blunderbussiers typically form <br> the backbone of the fel Dwarf infantry, <br> positioned behind the ranks of shield-bearing <br> warriors. They unleash coordinated volleys at <br> the command of their overseers, turning tightly <br> packed enemy formations into charnel houses. <br> The sight and sound of their simultaneous discharge, a veritable wall of flame and death, is often enough to break the morale of all but the most steadfast enemies.






\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

But the blunderbussiers are not just marksmen; like all fel dwarves, they are more than capable of holding their own in close-quarters combat. When their blunderbusses are no longer of use, these dwarves can quickly don shields and draw axes to engage foes, and the blunderbussiers are as fearsome and relentless as any of their kin when forced to fight hand-to-hand.

#### The Granite Gunmen
The granite gunmen represent the pinnacle of fel <br> dwarf marksmanship. An elite cadre of blunderbussiers, <br> they are renowned for their unerring accuracy and <br> ruthless precision. Each member of the granite gunmen <br> has honed their skills over decades, if not centuries, of unrelenting warfare, becoming master snipers capable <br> of picking off key targets even amidst the chaotic <br> tumult of battle.

In battle, the granite gunmen are masters of <br> suppressing enemy movement with their precision <br> shots. They focus their fire on key enemy units or <br> individuals, disrupting their movements and forcing <br> them to take cover. The sight of a granite gunman lining <br> up a shot is enough to make any warrior think twice <br> before advancing, such is their fearsome reputation.

The granite gunmen often serves as the personal bodyguards to fel dwarf overseers, providing them <br> with a formidable defensive line. Their ability to slow <br> and disrupt enemy forces proves invaluable in protecting their charges, making them a vital component of any <br> fel dwarf force.
To become a member of the granite gunmen is a great honor, and only the most skilled and dedicated blunderbussiers are considered for this prestigious role. These individuals undergo a grueling selection process, during which they must prove their mettle in a series of trials that test their skill, patience, and resolve.

### Infernal Vanguard

The warriors represent an elite cadre of fel dwarf soldiers in service of their dark masters. These fearsome warriors are bound together by a shared history of past failures, which they seek to atone for through unwavering loyalty, unmatched ferocity, and the merciless conquest of their enemies. The path of the infernal vanguard is one of redemption and suffering, as each member dons an iron mask that obscures their visage, a symbol of their shame and a constant reminder of the debts they must repay.

The iron masks serve not only as a sign of their penance but also as a tool of dehumanization, stripping the infernal vanguard of their individuality and forging them into a single, cohesive unit. Beneath these forbidding masks, the infernal vanguard finds solace in their shared purpose and the brutal path toward atonement they have been provided. In battle, these masks instill fear in the hearts of their enemies, as they come to understand that they face an adversary that is relentless, unforgiving, and without mercy.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

In their quest for redemption, the infernal <br> vanguard is often tasked with carrying out the most <br> dangerous and brutal missions for their dark masters. From leading daring assaults on heavily fortified strongholds to hunting down powerful adversaries deep within enemy territory, the infernal vanguard willingly accepts any challenge, no matter the odds or the cost. For these warriors, each successful mission brings them one step closer to absolution and the eventual removal of their iron masks, a moment of triumph that few among their ranks will ever know.

Encountering the infernal vanguard on the battlefield is a harrowing experience, as their foes must face not only the formidable prowess of these elite warriors but also the relentless determination that drives them. The infernal vanguard will stop at nothing to achieve their objectives and atone for their past failures, and those who stand in their way must be prepared to face the full fury of their wrath.

***Fireglaivadiers.*** Among the ranks of the infernal vanguard, those who are chosen to bear the fire glaives are regarded with a mixture of awe and dread. These fireglaivadiers, as they are known, represent the perfect union of martial prowess and inventive savagery that is the hallmark of the fel dwarves.

Donning their iron masks of atonement, each fireglaivadiers is handpicked for their skill, strength, and utter ruthlessness in battle. They are trained to master the Fire Glaive, a weapon as dangerous to its wielder as it is to the enemy if not handled with the utmost care. 


\columnbreak

Yet, these warriors wield their deadly tools with a seemingly effortless grace, shifting between devastating melee attacks and lethal ranged assaults as the tide of battle demands.

In battle, the fireglaivadiers form the vanguard of the fel dwarf armies, their flaming weapons carving swathes through the enemy ranks. Their presence on the battlefield is a sign of the fel dwarves' determination to achieve victory at any cost. For the fireglaivadiers do not merely fight – they annihilate, leaving nothing but scorched earth and burning wreckage in their wake.

### Infernal Hellsworn
The infernal hellsworn are the most elite members of the infernal vanguard, chosen for their unwavering loyalty, exceptional combat prowess, and unyielding devotion to the cause of their dark masters. Handpicked from the ranks of the infernal vanguard, these warriors are entrusted with the sacred duty of serving as personal soldiers and bodyguards for the highest-ranking fel dwarves, including sorcerer-priests, warlords, and other leaders of their dark society.

Throwable blasting charges are a signature weapon of the infernal hellsworn, a testament to the deadly ingenuity of the fel dwarves. Forged in the dark, magma-filled foundries deep within their subterranean strongholds, these compact and potent explosives combine alchemical prowess with the lethal cunning of their creators. The charges contain a highly volatile concoction of volatile minerals and arcane substances, carefully encased within a rugged iron shell. When hurled at enemies, the blasting charges detonate with devastating force, unleashing a searing wave of flame and shrapnel that can tear through flesh and armor alike.

In their role as protectors of the highest-ranking fel dwarves, the infernal hellsworn are expected to be ever-vigilant, anticipating and neutralizing any threat to their charges before it can manifest. Their keen senses, honed by years of brutal training and the harsh lessons of their past failures, enable them to detect the subtlest signs of danger, allowing them to react with lightning speed to counter any would-be assassins or saboteurs.

On a success, a creature takes half as much damage. <br>
> When the dwarf attempts to throw the bomb, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the dwarf this way, the dwarf drops the bomb, and it detonates at the dwarf's location.

### Overseers

Fel dwarf overseers are a distinct and influential caste within their dark society, serving as both slave masters and military generals. These cunning and ruthless individuals wield tremendous power and authority, overseeing the vast legions of slaves and lesser fel dwarves that toil in the name of their malevolent masters.

As slave masters, fel dwarf overseers are responsible for maintaining order and productivity within the sprawling slave workforce that fuels their dark empire. They are masters of manipulation and control, employing a combination of fear, brutality, and martial prowess to keep their thralls in line. In addition to the physical and psychological torment they inflict upon their captives, overseers use their unyielding authority and presence to ensure the unwavering obedience and submission of their slaves.

In their capacity as military generals, fel dwarf overseers are tasked with leading the armies of their dark masters into battle. They are shrewd tacticians and skilled commanders, well-versed in the arts of war and the unique capabilities of their diverse troops. From the disciplined ranks of the infernal vanguard to the rampaging hordes of enslaved creatures, the overseers expertly marshal these forces to achieve their masters' objectives with brutal efficiency.

> ***Harsh Discipline.*** The dwarf deals 5 (2d4) psychic damage to any number of allies within 60 feet of it that can hear it. This damage cannot reduce a creature's hit points to 0. Any creature damaged by this ability gains the dwarf's Resolute feature on its next turn, and must use it. If the creature already has the Resolute feature, its speed is no longer reduced to 0 when it uses the feature. Creatures immune to psychic damage are not affected by Harsh Discipline.

### Castellans

In the war-bent hierarchy of the fel dwarves, the castellans stand as towering figures of ruthless authority and raw power. These formidable warriors are chosen from the ranks of the infernal ironsword, singled out for their exceptional skill, tactical acumen, and the unyielding force of their will. Clad in the heaviest of armors and wielding their master-crafted fire glaives, the castellans are a sight to both inspire their allies and strike dread into their foes.

The castellans are more than mere captains. They are the embodiment of the fel dwarves' will to dominate, their relentless determination made manifest. Each castellan leads by fearsome example, plunging into the thickest of the melee or holding the line against overwhelming odds. Their presence on the battlefield is a rallying point for their kin, a beacon of unyielding defiance amidst the chaos of battle.

Castellans are bestowed with an ability unique to their rank – the power to infuse their underlings with a burning hatred that fuels their ferocity in battle. This hatred, shaped by the castellan's potent will, ignites their weapons with unholy flame, lending a fiery edge to their every strike. This fearsome power, combined with the castellan's own martial prowess, often turns the tide of battle in favor of the fel dwarves.

In their hands, the fire glaive is not just a weapon, but an instrument of inventive destruction. Castellans use special ammunition to maximize the havoc they wreak upon their enemies. Their molten bullets are not mere projectiles, but searing globes of liquid fire that embed themselves into their targets, burning them from the inside out in a spectacle of gruesome devastation. Even more fearsome are their exploding infernal slugs – projectiles filled with a volatile mixture that detonates upon impact, causing widespread carnage.

> ***Dwarven Resilience.*** The dwarf has advantage on saving throws against poison.
>
> ***Debilitating Strikes.*** When the dwarf reduces a creature to 0 hit points with an attack, that creature is stunned for the next minute, even if it regains hit points.
>
> ***Dig In.*** While the dwarf is in a Resolute Stance, it has resistance to all damage from ranged attacks, and its attack rolls with ranged weapons ignore half and three-quarters cover and don’t suffer disadvantage while attacking at a long range.
>
> ***Resolute Fire.*** While the dwarf is using its Resolute Stance, being within 5 feet of an enemy doesn’t impose disadvantage on its ranged attack rolls with weapons.
>
> ***Resolute Stance.*** At the start of the dwarf's turn, it can focus entirely on standing its ground mentally and physically. Until the start of its next turn, any attack roll made against the dwarf has disadvantage. Additionally, the dwarf makes Strength (Athletics) checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage. The dwarf loses this benefit if an effect moves it against its will or knocks it prone. If the dwarf uses this feature, its speed becomes 0 until the end of the current turn.

If an attack with this bullet hits a creature, the bullet from the weapon becomes embedded in the target for the next minute. While the bullet is embedded, the creature can't regain hit points, and at the end of each of its turns, it takes 11 (2d10) fire damage. <br>
>  The target creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check to attempt to remove the bullet. The target creature has disadvantage on the check to remove the bullet from itself. On a success, the bullet is removed, and on a failure, the creature takes 11 (2d10) fire damage.
>
> ***Infernal Slug (3/day).*** When the dwarf loads its fire glaive, it may choose to load it with an infernal slug. When the dwarf makes a ranged weapon attack using this slug, the slug explodes at the target location, regardless of whether it hits or misses the target. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) fire damage. A creature hit by the attack has disadvantage on the saving throw.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The dwarf makes two attacks.
>
> ***Fire Glaive.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft. or range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10  + 3) piercing damage. If it was a ranged attack, it deals an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage. If the dwarf made a ranged attack, it can’t do so again with this weapon until it loads it as an action or in place of an attack that’s part of an attack action. It can also load it when it uses its Resolute Stance feature (no action required).
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Infusion of Hatred (3/day).*** The dwarf chooses one other creature it can see within 30 feet of it and infuses it with hatred for the next minute. While infused this way, the first time the creature hits with an attack each turn, it deals additional 5 (1d10) fire damage.

### Fel Dwarf Soldier Loot
Because fel dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Fel Dwarf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Fel Dwarf Infantry Tactics
Fel dwarfs are twisted versions of regular dwarves who possess perverted versions of traditional dwarven traits. Dwarven stubbornness has turned to unrelenting hatred, their love of crafting has been channeled into the creation of weapons of destruction, and their pride now causes them to see all others as beneath them. 

Despite these grotesque changes in attitude, the combat tactics of fel dwarfs differ little from those of their standard kin. They are most effective when occupying a fortified position and using ranged weaponry to batter their enemies from afar while their unyielding melee forces hold the line.

One significant difference in combat strategy stems from their reliance on acquiring forced labor, as fel dwarf society runs on the backs of captured prisoners who are relentlessly worked to death. This means fel dwarves will not be content to drive an enemy off. If an enemy force flees, and the fel dwarves believe they have an overwhelming combat advantage, they will chase down their foes to capture them. 

There are two abilities common to all fel dwarves:

#### Resolute Stance

Dwarves can best use this ability when fighting in confined spaces that don’t require much movement. The optimal scenario involves a mix of ranged and melee dwarf combatants. The ranged dwarves will hunker down behind cover with this ability, making it very difficult to counter them with ranged attacks. They will then have melee dwarfs stand about 5 or 10 feet in front of them to stop anyone who approaches with readied attacks. Dwarves are patient and resilient, so they will tolerate taking fire from enemies this way if it seems like their own ranged attacks are outpacing their enemies’.

If the players bombard fel dwarves with area-of-effect attacks or effects that force saving throws, this may force dwarves out of their defensive position and cause them to charge the players or even flee if they’ve taken heavy damage. Though, many fel dwarves can resist common damage types such as poison and fire, which may allow them to better endure such abilities.

When dwarves use this ability, be sure to communicate it to the players. You can say something to the effect of “the dwarf plants his feet firmly and stares you down, ready for anything that comes at him.”

#### Debilitating Strike

The primary purpose of this ability is to allow fel dwarves to take prisoners of war to serve as forced labor. They will do non-lethal damage when bringing creatures down to 0 hit points, even if they’re fighting a group with a healer. 

#### Fel Dwarf Warriors

Fel Dwarf warriors act as the frontline in battle. When part of a well-balanced army, they generally use the standard fel dwarf tactics described earlier. However, if they are the only type of soldier on the battlefield, they will take one of two tactics depending on the situation.
* If the enemy can attack from range, the dwarfs charge into melee combat, taking the Dash action if needed to get within range. On their next turn, they will take a Resolute stance and fight, forcing their opponent to either fight them in melee with disadvantage or take an opportunity attack to withdraw.
* If the enemy charges the fel dwarf warriors, they will merely hold their position with Resolute Stance and ready attacks for when the enemy comes within reach.

Fel dwarf warriors prioritize attacking targets they can reach while in a Resolute Stance.

##### Burning Beard Warriors

When burning beards are on fire, their attacks deal more damage. Moreover, when they attack an enemy that is already on fire, it causes even more damage. Their main priority is to set as many enemies and other burning beards on fire. There are several ways to achieve this, including:
* If a burning beard is moving towards an enemy and can't quite reach them, they can throw a naphtha bomb that hits the enemy and themselves on the opposite edge of the blast radius.
* If a burning beard is in a resolute stance and doesn't want to move, it may use its naphtha bomb as described above.
* Running into a group of creatures using their burning resolve ability is also quite effective.

####  Blunderbussiers
Blunderbussier tactics are simpler than those of melee fel dwarf infantry, as they only need to find a good vantage point from which to enter a Resolute Srance and start blasting their foes. There are a few factors to keep in mind:
* The blunderbuss is a two-handed weapon, so the dwarf cannot hold a shield while using it.
* The Piercing Rounds ability means that the dwarf will prioritize targets with high AC but low health.
* After each attack with a blunderbuss, the dwarf must either use up its next action to reload it or enter a Resolute Stance at the start of its next turn, which will prevent it from moving. 
* If the dwarf cannot reload its blunderbuss effectively and is caught in melee combat, it will not hesitate to switch to a shield and axe to fight.

##### The Granite Gunmen
These soldiers are even more effective snipers than normal blunderbussiers, though they have no qualms about engaging isolated creatures in melee combat if need be.

One difference in their tactics stems from their Suppressing Fire ability, which makes them more likely to shoot targets that rely on speed, such as rogues.

#### Infernal Vanguards
These are elite dwarven soldiers that fight with unflinching resolve. Their tactics will depend on what they’re armed with.


\pagebreakNum



##### Axemen
These infernal vanguards are just a stronger version of fel dwarf warriors, with the only mechanical difference being that their attacks made with advantage hit even harder. Their tactics are essentially the same as normal fel dwarf warriors. 

##### Fireglaivadiers
Fireglaivadiers are unique in that they have a ranged attack but are more effective in melee combat. There are several attack sequences they can use:

When in a Resolute Stance with an enemy in melee range, they can make both a ranged attack and a melee attack. Since they don't suffer disadvantage from using ranged attacks in melee combat, this is the most effective attack pattern.

When in a Resolute Stance with no enemies nearby, they can only make a single ranged attack. This is useful when defending a position and waiting for enemies to come to them.

If the dwarf is close to a pursuing enemy or slowly retreating, they can make two melee attacks.

When trying to finish off fleeing targets, they can fire their weapon and use their other attack to reload. This is not an optimal attack pattern and should be avoided as possible.


#### Infernal Hellsworn
The main difference between infernal hellsworn and other fel dwarf infantry is their blasting charges. They will usually use their blasting charges when they are being charged, when charging toward an enemy, or if they can hit three or more targets. However, there are two things they must watch out for:

* Enemies within their reach can interrupt the grenade and cause it to detonate on top of the dwarf.
* When throwing the grenade, the dwarf must consider that other dwarves may be hit by the blast. Some dwarves are resistant to fire or outright immune in the case of the infernal ironguard. However, if dwarves caught in the blast are in a resolute stance, they will have disadvantage on the saving throw and likely take the full piercing damage from the blast. Depending on the circumstances, the infernal hellsworn may still opt to use the bombs even if they hit allies.

##### The Immortals
The signature ability of The Immortals is their Undying Will. It's important to note that they start the fight with extra temporary hit points granted by this ability. The Immortals typically begin the fight clustered together and try to bait out area-of-effect spells from the enemy, hoping that it won't deal enough damage to break their Undying Will, and they'll simply regain their lost temporary hit points. They may avoid this tactic if they know the enemy has area-of-effect spells that deal damage other than fire. Once The Immortals have spread out, they use their Undying Will to keep themselves safe while moving into prime positions. They prefer to fight one-on-one, as facing multiple enemies poses a greater risk of damage overcoming their Undying Will.

\columnbreak



#### Fel Dwarf Overseers
Fel dwarf overseers can make their allies more aggressive. They are most effective when the overseer has a mix of cheap expendable units, such as forced laborers and more elite dwarves and warriors.

##### Brutal Motivation
The overseer can use one of his attacks to kill one of his laborers to activate this ability. As long as at least two of his dwarves benefit from it, he will consider it a worthwhile tradeoff. The overseer can also trigger the ability by reducing an enemy to zero hit points, but this is a risky move and should only be done if he’s sure to bring the enemy down.

##### Harsh Discipline
The overseer sends non-dwarf laborers to slow down the enemy before using this ability on his dwarves and any laborers within range. This allows the laborers to better hold their ground and the dwarves to march forward and fight more effectively.

#### Fel Dwarf Castellans
Fel dwarf castellans share most of the techniques used by fireglaivadiers, with a couple of new abilities added to their arsenal:

##### Infusion of Hatred
This enhancement is placed on the most deadly dwarf under the castellan’s command who is not already benefiting from it, and it will use this bonus action every turn during combat. 

##### Specialized Ammunition
The castellan has two specialized bullets that it can fire from its fire glaive and will use them in different ways depending on the spacing of its opponents.

If its enemies are grouped up, it will use Infernal Slugs if it can affect three or more targets with the slug’s blast. Otherwise, it will use Molten Bullets on creatures that are either the most isolated from their allies or concentrating on spells. This can set up a deadly combo as party members attempt to assist each other with pulling out the Molten Bullets, while the castellan can take full advantage of them being near each other to pelt them with Infernal Slugs.


#### Dwarves With Polearms
The variant rule that allows dwarves to use halberds does not change their tactics but improves the already listed tactics, as having reach enables them to use their Resolute Stance more frequently. If you’re using this rule, keep in mind that it does remove the dwarves’ weakness to reach weapons. This is a more realistic tactical choice on their part, but it also gives players few options to counter them.

## Iron Demons

These war machines are a testament to the engineering prowess and malevolent ingenuity of the fel dwarves. A terrifying blend of heavy machinery, intricate runic bindings, and bound demonic spirits, these monstrosities roar across the battlefield like metal leviathans, leaving nothing but scorched earth in their wake.

Iron Demons are usually designed as locomotive-like behemoths, propelled by infernal steam engines and armored in layers of rune-carved obsidian and infernal iron. Their primary armament typically consists of large cannons capable of shattering fortifications or incinerating entire infantry formations. However, some variants are equipped with flamethrowers instead, turning them into mobile infernos that are particularly effective against densely packed enemies or for area denial purposes.

Iron demons are not only machines of war but also formidable means of transport and logistics within the fel dwarf armies. Their immense strength and durability make them ideal for towing even the heaviest war machines across the most unforgiving terrains.

These sentient war machines gain magical properties and a malign sentience that drives an unnerving hunger for destruction. The integration of these spirits is a dangerous and delicate process. An iron demon with a slain crew can go berserk, the bound spirit throwing off its chains and embarking on a rampage. Yet, in the hands of a skilled fel dwarf hellsmith, these risks can be mitigated, turning the Iron Demons into truly formidable instruments of war.

 In the thick of battle, these infernal engines can be seen dragging artillery pieces, arcane siege engines, and other dread contraptions into optimal firing positions, transforming the battlefield into a terrible shooting gallery. 

Outside of combat, they haul troops, precious resources, necessary supplies, and vast amounts of weaponry across the harsh landscapes that the fel dwarves have conquered. The distant rumble and the sight of an iron demon, belching smoke and fire, dragging its ominous cargo across a desolate waste, is a dreaded testament to the relentless industry and fearsome power of the fel dwarves.

### Demon’s Tongue Variant
You can replace the Burning Cannon weapon of an iron demon with a demon’s tongue flamethrower. To do so, replace the Burning Cannon action station with the following and increase the vehicle’s CR to 14.

***Daemon's Tongue (Requires 1 Crew and Grants Three-Quarters Cover).*** The flamethrower lets a loses a torrent of fire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (10d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


### Hellbound Variant
You can create a variant of the iron demon, which possesses an incorporeal demonic entity trapped within it that attempts to break free from the control of its masters. The iron demon has the following changes:
* It has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

* It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical weapons 

* Any damage dealt by it is magical.

* It has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10.

* If it fails on an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, it may choose to succeed on the save and roll on the mishap table instead. It may not do this if the save was caused by the spell *dispel evil and good* or similar magic that ends a possession. In this case, a failed save results in the iron demon losing all the hellbound variant traits as the demon spirit is expelled.

* It counts as a fiend when determining the effects of features such as a paladin’s Divine Smite or a ranger’s Primeval Awareness.

* If it would roll on for a mishap, instead, each creature in the iron demon must make DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this reduces a humanoid creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies, and its death gives the demon spirit enough power to break free. While free, the iron demon rolls initiative and has its own turn, and no creature can use any of its action stations. On its turn, the iron demon can use the Helm action even if no creature is at the Helm.

### Iron Demon Loot
Because iron demons are vehicles, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are items they were carrying or materials salvaged from their remains. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks or may not require a check to spot at all. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Iron Demon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Iron Demon Tactics
The iron demon serves as both a deadly artillery piece and a hard-hitting chariot capable of smashing through weak battle lines. The key to its successful use lies in knowing when to charge in and when to keep its distance. Tactics can vary greatly depending on whether the iron demon has a carriage dragged behind it and the type of creatures driving it.

When driven by two dwarf engineers, the iron demon utilizes its high speed to circle the opposing force, seeking an opening while unleashing devastating firepower from its burning cannon. Once it has weakened several targets, it charges vulnerable targets while avoiding getting surrounded by enemies. Sometimes, it maximizes its speed and rams directly into the target, aiming to pass through its foes and evade potential retaliation on its next turn. It generally avoids ending its turn within reach of three or more creatures that can attack it.

If equipped with a demon's tongue flamethrower, the iron demon becomes especially adept at kiting enemies. It prioritizes ramming into the largest group of creatures it can reach, plowing through as many as possible. Then it positions itself about 30 feet away from the creatures after the charge to unleash its fire blast.

The hellbound variant of iron demon uses similar tactics while under control. However, once the demon inside breaks free, all tactical considerations go out the window. It becomes an animal driven solely by bloodlust, ruthlessly ramming anything or anyone in its path in the fastest way possible.

## Fel Dwarf Engineer

Fel dwarf engineers are a formidable blend of craftsmen, artificers, and battle strategists. They are responsible for the creation and operation of the race's numerous war machines, including the fearsome Iron Demons and other infernal devices. These engineers view their creations not just as tools, but as manifestations of their veneration for the dark powers they serve. Their unique understanding of the arcane, the mechanical, and the fusion of the two make them exceptionally dangerous on and off the battlefield.

These enginneers possess an uncanny affinity for commanding the infernal spirits bound within their war machines. The construction and binding rituals are jealously guarded secrets, passed down through the generations in a complex tapestry of oral traditions and rune-etched schematics. They use their deep understanding of these forbidden arts to control and unleash their destructive creations with chilling precision.

When using fel dwarf war machines in your games, fel dwarf engineers are ideal for crewing and operating these devices. They will generally fight so long as their machines are operational and flee if they have no war machines on hand they can put to use.

## Infernal Destroyer

These fiendish creations represent the pinnacle <br> of fel dwarf craftsmanship and their ability to <br> bind demons within machines. Infernal destroyers are massive constructs that stand as titanic embodiments <br> of the fel dwarves' irreverent audacity and relentless pursuit of power. Each infernal destroyer is unique, meticulously designed and crafted by the most skilled fel dwarf engineers and infusors, reflecting the personality, preferences, and ambitions of its creator.

During their creation, a grand ritual of binding is undertaken, calling forth a powerful demon spirit from the chaotic abyss and entrapping it within the cold iron of the construct. This demonic essence provides the machine with a sinister semblance of life and fuels its formidable abilities. The metal of an infernal destroyer is superheated by the trapped spirit, causing it to glow with a fearsome, otherworldly light and scorch the earth it walks upon.

Infernal destroyers can take a variety of forms, from hulking siege machines in the shape of bulls to monstrous constructs with draconic forms and flaming wings capable of decimating entire armies. The exact abilities of a destroyer vary with its form and purpose. Some might be fitted with massive armor, others might devastate their foes with an array of slashing blades across their body, and yet others may shatter foes with mighty charges and fiendish horns.

\columnbreak

Despite their terrifying power, infernal destroyers are not without vulnerabilities. The fiery demon spirits that animate them are a volatile source of power, pushing the metal bodies of the constructs to their limits. If the destroyer has sustained heavy damage and continues to exert itself, the demonic energies within will begin tearing it apart and hindering its ability to operate. Should this process continue unchecked while the destroyer continues to fight, the volatile forces within will eventually destroy it from the inside out. 

Despite this weakness, infernal destroyers can typically win the day for their fel dwarf masters before collapsing. Their masters then quickly recover their remains so they can be repaired and reanimated for their next rampage.

### Destroyer Enhancements
If you wish to create a more powerful version of the infernal destroyer, you can give it one of the following enhancements. Doing so increases its CR to 18.

#### Bovine Horns

*This destroyer has been forged in the likeness of a great bull, and if it picks up enough momentum, its horns can shatter mountains.*

When the destroyer makes a Slam attack, it deals extra 13 (2d12) piercing damage on hit for every 20 feet it moved straight toward the target before it hit. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 16), it can't stand up until the start of the destroyer's next turn.

#### Blazing Wings

*The destroyer has been equipped with flaming wings capable of unleashing waves of fire when it lands on the ground.*

The destroyer has a fly speed of 60.

Additionally, if the destroyer is flying and dives at least 20 feet in a straight line before landing on the ground, each other creature standing on the ground within 10 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. 

For each additional 20 feet the destroyer dove before landing, the area of the effect increases by 10 feet, and the damage increases by 9 (2d8).

#### Colossal Plating

*The destroyer has been fitted with large black iron plates welded on either side of its body and etched with unholy runes, which render it nearly indestructible unless they can be removed.*

The destroyer starts with two iron plates attached to it. For each plate attached, it gets +3 to all saving throws and its AC (+6 while both are attached). A creature within 5 feet of the destroyer can use its action to make a DC 21 Strength check to detach one of the plates. It may add its proficiency bonus if it is proficient with Smith's Tools. The creature takes 10(3d6) fire damage when it makes the check if the destroyer's Blazing Body trait is active.

#### Gore Blades

*The destroyer’s body has been covered in razor-sharp blades capable of slicing apart any who draw near.*.

The destroyer's Slam now deals 29 (6d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6) fire damage on hit.

When a creature misses with a melee attack against the destroyer while within 5 feet of it, attempts to grapple it, or starts its turn grappling it, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage. 

Additionally, when a creature moves into or within the area the destroyer is occupying, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

### Infernal Destroyer Loot
Because infernal destroyers are constructs, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Infernal Destroyer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Infernal Destroyer Tactics

Infernal destroyers are mindless monsters, driven solely by their destructive instincts, with little regard for their own survival. They never flee from a fight and will fight to the death. However, their creators can guide their actions and may direct them to execute more complex tactics. If these creators are killed or incapacitated, the destroyer will revert back to its base instincts.

Infernal destroyers serve as hard-hitting shock troopers. Because their Burning Bright feature causes them to become unstable over time and lose attacks as they take damage, their best defense is their offense, hitting with such force that opponents struggle to properly retaliate from the brutal attacks. 

When guided by a more intelligent mind, they may attempt to engage the largest group of enemies to set them ablaze with their Blazing Body feature, focusing all attacks on any targets they believe will resist being burned away by their aura. They may unleash a 'Burning Barrage' to target backline foes, especially those casting dangerous spells. 

Armies with one or more infernal destroyers will follow similar tactics, aiming to hit hard at the beginning of the fight to break their enemies, utilizing all available resources and their strongest spells early in combat before their destroyers run the risk of destabilizing.

Infernal destroyers can be equipped with one of four upgrades that slightly alter their tactics:
* **Blazing Wings:** Allows them to disrupt backline foes by flying past sturdy front liners and slamming into groups of ranged combatants and spellcasters.

* **Colossal Plating:** Turns them into juggernauts, helping them stay alive. Their dwarven allies will focus on impeding whoever is most likely to remove the plating.

* **Gore Blades:** Enables them to shred through swarms of melee enemies, staying in the front line and serving as a blockade to protect more vulnerable creatures fighting alongside the destroyer.

* **Razer Horns:** Enhances their ability to destroy single targets. Fragile damage dealers, such as lightly armored wizards, will be decimated if the destroyer reaches them, and the destroyer is not afraid to take opportunity attacks if it means getting a charge against its intended target.

# Self-Propelled Vehicles
Most land vehicles in fantasy settings are pulled by other creatures, such as wagons, carriages, or chariots. However, through some combination of technology or magic, some vehicles may be self-propelled and driven by a passenger. These may be relatively small mechanical contraptions, magically self-propelled carriages, or mighty war machines rumbling across blasted battlefields. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these vehicle types in your games. They can be applied to vehicles of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own vehicles. The rules here can be applied to most self-powered vehicles piloted by a passenger. 

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Rules
Self-propelled vehicles are vehicles able to move without needing to be pushed or pulled by another creature, and they usually don’t need an external energy source (such as wind). Throughout this document, they will be referred to simply as vehicles. Creatures within a vehicle are referred to as passengers. 
In combat, vehicles use most of the same rules as creatures, with the following additional considerations:

### Opportunity Attacks
Vehicles provoke opportunity attacks as usual. When a vehicle provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle itself or any creature riding on or inside it, provided they are within reach and do not have total cover.



\columnbreak

### Spacing Within Vehicles
All creatures within a vehicle count as being within 5 feet of each other.


### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Entering or exiting the vehicle costs a creature half of its movement. Each creature inside the vehicle may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting.


### Crashing into Creatures and Objects
A vehicle can crash into a creature or object by entering its space. When it does, the creature or object must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice) using the vehicle's DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved in a straight line before attempting to enter the target's space (maximum 20d6 damage).

If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage and is not knocked prone. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the vehicle's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. A target can only make this saving throw once per turn.

If the vehicle is at least two size categories larger than the target it crashed into, it can continue moving through the target's space if it has any movement remaining. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop. If the target is an impassable object that could reasonably damage the vehicle, such as an iron wall, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6 damage). Each creature on or inside the vehicle takes the damage as well

\pagebreakNum

### Prone Vehicles
If vehicle falls prone, it cannot right itself and is incapacitated until it is flipped upright.

### Falling Vehicles
When a vehicle falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position. If the vehicle falls due to the actions of its driver (such as jumping off a ramp) it may not land prone (DM’s discretion) but still takes fall damage.



### Repairing Vehicles
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
Certain circumstances can cause a vehicle to malfunction and eventually break down due to wear and tear. This wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion rules, as described in Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with the following modifications:

* When a vehicle reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
* The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a vehicle is through repair. This can be done using the <br> rules described in the Repairing Vehicles section <br> above. If the attempt to repair the vehicle <br> succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level <br> decreases by 1. If the check fails, the <br> vehicle's exhaustion level remains <br> unchanged, but the repair attempt <br> can be made again using <br> the same tools and <br> replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these vehicles have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A vehicle's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a vehicle's hit points reach 0, it becomes inoperative and is irreparably damaged.
### Damage Threshold
Most vehicles possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A vehicle with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the vehicle takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the vehicle's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the vehicle's hit points.

### Mishap Threshold
When a vehicle sustains damage from a single source that is equal to or exceeds its mishap threshold, it is required to roll on the Mishaps table (refer to the Mishaps section).

\pagebreakNum

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the vehicle comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the vehicle.

### Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity indicates the maximum weight of cargo the vehicle can carry.

### Vehicle DC 
Whenever the vehicle requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ability Scores 
A vehicle possesses the standard six ability scores that creatures have, along with their corresponding modifiers. The Strength of the vehicle is determined by its size and weight, while Dexterity represents its handling and maneuverability. The Constitution of a vehicle reflects its durability and quality of construction. In most cases, vehicles have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a vehicle has a score of 0 in a particular ability score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that relies on that score.

### Action Stations
A vehicle may have one or more Action Stations. Each of these stations requires a certain number of creatures to operate and may grant those creatures some amount of cover. The creatures operating these stations must be passengers within the vehicle, but not all passengers need to be operating a station. A creature operating a station <br> can use an action to activate the station's effect.  <br> A station can be occupied by only one <br> creature at a time and can only <br> be activated once per round. 

\columnbreak

#### The Helm 
Most vehicles that must be piloted by a passenger (referred to as the driver) have an Action Station known as the Helm, where the vehicle's movement is controlled. It usually consists of a chair equipped with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. If a vehicle has a helm with no one operating it, it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver who is proficient with land vehicles can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

The driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring it to a complete stop. While the vehicle is in motion, the driver can steer it along any desired course. If the driver becomes incapacitated, leaves the helm, or takes no action to alter the vehicle's course and speed, the vehicle will continue moving in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it collides with an obstacle large enough to stop its movement.


### Mishaps
Most vehicles have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways its functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishaps Table. 

To resolve a Mishap, a creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (refer to the Mishaps section). If the vehicle is moving, the check is made with disadvantage. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for the repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.
