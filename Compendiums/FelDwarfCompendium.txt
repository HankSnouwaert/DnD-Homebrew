# Fel Dwarf Compendium

The Fel Dwarves are a cruel and pitiless race, their hearts blackened by centuries of tyranny, conquest, and infernal corruption. Once noble kin to other dwarves, they long ago severed all ties to honor, embracing fiendish sorcery and ruthless industry. Now, they stand as brutal overlords, ruling through fear, slavery, and an insatiable hunger for power. To them, strength is law, cruelty is virtue, and conquest is purpose.

This corruption has reshaped not just their minds but their bodies as well. Their blackened, gnarled features are marked with deep cracks, as if scorched by fire. Many sport horn-like protrusions, jagged spines, or ridged skulls, grim testaments to their dark pacts. Some have smoldering beards, wreathed in embers or slick with alchemical oils, while their glowing eyes burn with a cold, calculating malice.

**Masters of the Infernal Depths.** Fel Dwarves carve their empires from the most inhospitable and hellish landscapes, thriving in volcanic wastelands, abyssal caverns, and cursed ruins. Their obsidian citadels, choked with smoke, rise from these hellish domains, their forges burning without end. Beneath them, endless hordes of slaves toil in misery, crafting weapons, war machines, and daemon-forged horrors under the lash.

Their society is a brutal hierarchy, ruled by Demon-Smith Prophets, sorcerer-engineers who command with unquestioned authority.

Beneath them, warlords, priests, and slavedrivers enforce their will, ensuring that the empire’s gears of conquest never cease turning. The weak are fuel for the empire, whether as laborers, sacrifices, or experiments in their ever-growing arsenal of war.

**Conquerors and Slavers.** Fel Dwarves do not simply invade and conquer—they strip the land bare. Entire civilizations are crushed, their people shackled and their cities ground into dust. Those who resist are slaughtered; those who surrender face eternal servitude in the factories, mines, and forges of the empire.

On the battlefield, they combine relentless discipline with unholy war machines, unleashing heavily armored warriors, fiendish artillery, and demonic constructs in devastating waves of destruction. Their black iron legions march with mechanical precision, their siege engines belching fire and molten metal as their sorcerer-priests call upon dark gods for destruction.

**A Legacy of Ruin.** Though their empire is vast and unmatched, Fel Dwarves are not without enemies. Slave revolts, rival demon cults, and their own insatiable hunger for power threaten to consume them from within. The very forces they wield grow unstable, their bound daemons straining against their chains.

Yet they do not fear collapse. They welcome destruction, believing that in the end, only the strongest will reshape the world in their image. Until that day comes, they will continue their conquest, leaving only ashes and ruin in their wake.

## Running Fel Dwarf Encounters
The setting you’re running your adventures in will help determine the background of this dwarven race and the specifics of their lore. In some settings, they may be twisted by the forces of fel into malevolent beings. If your setting has a cosmology aligned with more classical D&D settings, these dwarves will likely align themselves with devils, given that they share a lawful evil and tyrannical nature. 

### Fel Dwarf Motivations and Adventure Setups

Regardless of the lore and setting specifics, these dwarves are defined by their conquering industrialist nature. Players could encounter and come into conflict with fel dwarves under many types of circumstances. You can use the table on the next page as inspiration for ways to introduce fel dwarves into your campaign:


##### Fel Dwarf Adventure Setups

| d8  | Setup |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Resource Contention:** Fel dwarves are relentless in their pursuit of valuable resources, such as precious metals, gems, or magical artifacts. Players might find themselves competing with these malevolent beings for control of a recently discovered mine, an ancient ruin, or a forgotten vault. |
|  2  | **Servitude and Oppression:** Fel dwarves are notorious for their brutal treatment of captured laborers and conquered peoples. Players might be tasked with liberating enslaved individuals or communities, or they may find themselves captured by the fel dwarves and forced to fight for their freedom. |
|  3  | **Tyrannical Conquerers:** Players may be visiting frontier towns in danger of being conquered and enslaved by an invasion force of fel dwarves on the march.  |
|  4  | **Dark Alliances:** Fel dwarves are known to forge alliances with other malevolent forces, such as fiendish entities, evil warlords, or twisted cults. Players may cross paths with fel dwarves while investigating or combating these dark forces. |
|  5  | **Magical Catastrophes:** Fel dwarves wield a potent combination of arcane power and technological prowess. Their experiments and machinations can sometimes result in magical disasters, which could threaten the players' homeland or disrupt the balance of power in the region. |
|  6  | **Exploration and Adventure:** Players venturing into the dark and inhospitable regions where fel dwarves dwell may stumble upon their citadels or outposts.  |


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

|   |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  7  | **Intrigue and Subterfuge:** Fel dwarves are cunning and manipulative, and they may infiltrate other societies to further their nefarious goals. Players might be tasked with unmasking a fel dwarf spy or uncovering a plot to destabilize a city or kingdom.
|  8  | **Ancient Grudges:** Many fel dwarves bear long-standing grudges against their noble kin, and they may actively seek to undermine or destroy dwarven settlements or interests. Players aligned with dwarven factions may be called upon to defend against fel dwarf incursions or sabotage. |

### Roleplaying Fel Dwarves

Fel dwarves are ambitious power seekers, always looking to advance themselves above others. They view other races with contempt, seeing their kind as superior to all others. Fel dwarves meeting the players will either see them as a means to an end or as obstacles to be destroyed. They may be willing to trade with the players, but if the players are aligned with forces opposed to the interest of the fel dwarves or their masters, they will likely turn on the players before long.  

Consider these traits when playing on the decisions and behavior of fel dwarves. They are not reckless barbarians, but calculating tyrants, always looking for that chance to further their machinations, enhance their wealth, or advance in power. That said, they still value loyalty to their masters, and though they scheme and plot their way up through their hierarchies, fel dwarves will carry out their assigned duties without question. For it is through this loyalty and cold, calculating devotion they hope to advance in power.

### Fel Dwarf Tactics
In combat, fel dwarves are stubborn, brutal, and capable of executing complex tactics utilizing a mix of different units. The fel dwarf forces can include many types of soldiers, machines, and creatures, but there are tactical trends that can be found through most of their kind:

***Low Mobility.*** Like most dwarven forces, fel dwarves fight best when they can force their enemies to come to them. They often make use of monsters and more mobile soldiers of other races to compensate for their lack of speed. Still, even these forces perform best when attacking foes already tangled up in combat with the elite fel dwarf soldiers.

***Heavy Firepower.*** Like many of their dwarven kin, fel dwarves are master crafters and engineers. They create advanced firearms and artillery weapons imbued with fiendish power, which they bring to bare on their foes whenever possible.

***Mixed Forces.*** Between their heavy infantry, masses of expendable laborers, mobile creatures, menacing monsters, diabolic magic, and technically advanced firearms and war machines, fel dwarves have a multitude of options at their disposal. And they excel at combining these forces in ways that offset their weaknesses.

***Enslavers.*** Fel dwarf society runs on the back of forced labor, and they are always in need of more workers. Fel dwarves avoid killing enemies in combat when it can feasibly be avoided. Defeated foes are transported back to the nearest fel dwarf settlement, where they are quickly put to work.

***Heartless Discipline.*** Fel dwarves possess the same level of resolve as their uncorrupted kin and will carry out battle plans to a tee, even putting themselves in danger to do so. To do anything less is considered a sign of weakness, and there is nothing fel dwarves despise more than weakness.

\columnbreak

#### Engagement
Dwarves prefer to force their enemies to engage them. They will attempt to bombard foes with superior firepower to force an approach. Ideally, this allows the heavy dwarven infantry to engage their foes without needing to move to make the engagement themselves. This means of combat initiation is rarely subtle, and fel dwarves typically do not attempt to sneak up on their enemies unless they’re utilizing stealthier minions of other races.

#### Combat
In battle, fel dwarves seek to outlast their foes with durable creatures or masses of laborers while brutally breaking them into submission through superior firepower. They seek to establish a superior position in battle from which they can withstand any attacks while laying waste to their foes. What position they take and how they bring down their foes will depend on the creatures and weapons the fel dwarves have at their disposal. They rarely fight with only one type of creature and usually rely on mixing strategies to offset exploitable weaknesses.

#### Retreat
Fel dwarves are stubborn, but they aren’t stupid. If they see that their strategy has been countered, they may retreat to regroup and gather what they need to overcome their foes. If fel dwarves suffer heavy losses, they will retreat to a more defensible position while calling for backup. 
If their enemies are retreating, the fel dwarves will pursue them whenever possible, as defeated and fleeing foes present a prime opportunity for rounding up new laborers.

## New Fel Dwarf Weapons
Fel dwarves are known for their wicked ingenuity and have invented destructive firearms beyond the capabilities of most other races. The following firearm weapons are used by some of the fel dwarf infantry described later and can be made available to players at the DM’s discretion. 

***Blunderbuss.*** Crafted in the dark forges of the fel dwarves, blunderbusses are marvels of dark engineering, combining the dwarven knack for craftsmanship with cruel, destructive intent. Larger and more potent than the firearms wielded by their kin, these weapons are loaded with a lethal mix of shot, black powder, and arcane substances. When fired, they unleash devastating projectiles capable of decimating enemy ranks and piercing the strongest armor.

***Fire Glaive.*** These infernal weapons combine the melee capabilities of a traditional glaive with a rifle capable of shooting flaming projectiles. Fire glaives are rare and expensive to produce and, as such, are only used by the most elite fel dwarf soldiers. Soldiers utilizing these weapons are able to act as hybrid warriors, alternating between melee and ranged combat depending on the needs of the battle.

#### Blunderbuss
*ranged weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 3d10
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Ammunition (range 80/320), reload (1), heavy, two-handed

# New Spells

## Lore of Death

This brand of magic plays on the nature of mortality and fragility of life, though it is strictly distinct from traditional necromancy, as it embraces the inevitability of death rather than attempting to deny it. Its users can manipulate negative energy, sap the vitality of foes, and instill mortal terror in those around them. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Death often wield.

#### Aspect of Dread
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

## Lore of Fire

This brand of magic draws on the power of elemental fire. This arcane fire is often fueled by powerful emotions, and those who wield it are often known for their reckless and headstrong behavior. By channeling their fiery nature into their magic, these pyromancers can unleash an array of devastating spells capable of burning foes to cinders. These spells all tend to conjure and manipulate fire in some way and are very aggressive in nature. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Fire often wield.

#### Burning Bolts

A creature takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one line is affected only once.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create one additional line of flames for each slot level above 6th.

A 5-foot-diameter flaming head appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. When the head appears, it lets out a terrifying screech. Creatures of your choice that can see and hear the head within 100 feet of it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the head until the spell ends. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the head, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Contact With The Head.** Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the head must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you move the head, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The head ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

## Lore of Fel Dwarves
This fiendish magic was developed by the devil-worshipping fel dwarves and embodies their ability to dominate not only the will of others but the very earth itself. Many of their spells conjure a brutal mix of fire and earth, incinerating or crushing foes with molten rock. Other spells twist the will of others, instilling deep hatred or fear and subservience. While these spells are most commonly used by fel dwarves, other fiendish spell casters or those with close ties to fire and earth may wield this magic as well.

While obsessed, the target has advantage on attack rolls against the chosen creature.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it did not take an action during the turn or the source of its obsession is not within line of sight, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a success, the spell ends.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 ft

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range and a direction. A giant hammer manifests and slams the ground at the chosen point, impacting everything in a 10-foot cube centered on the point. It then sends a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-wide shockwave in the chosen direction before disappearing.

Each creature in the area of the hammer’s impact or shockwave must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 fire or lighting damage (your choice) and 5d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone; it is also dazed* until the end of its next turn if it is in the area of the impact. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or dazed.

Additionally, the first time each turn the target takes damage of the chosen type, it takes an extra 1d6 damage of that type.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

> #####  Divine Hammer Damage Types
> Depending on the nature of the god the spellcaster worships, it may make more sense for the divine hammer to do damage of a type other than fire or lighting; for example, some gods may be more associated with radiant or necrotic. At the DM's discretion, the damage can be changed this way, in which case the spellcaster should no longer have the option for fire or lighting.

After the area cools down, it remains difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

The sphere lasts for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The sphere spreads around corners and seeps through openings at least 5 feet in diameter.

When the sphere first appears, and at the start of each of your turns thereafter, it moves 10 feet in the direction you hurled it from.

## Lore of Metal

This brand of magic specializes in manipulating metals and mechanical objects. It is favored by alchemists, artificers, and those specializing in transmutation magic. Spells from this lore can conjure metal for offensive and defensive purposes, alter the properties of objects to hinder their use, or even transmute creatures into gold. 

#### Commandment of Inertia

*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of glue)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Artificer

You touch a construct creature or an object with moving parts that weighs no more than 4,000 pounds and is no larger than a 20-foot cube. 

**Construct.** A construct targeted this way must make a Dexterity saving throw or be paralyzed for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

**Object.** An object targeted this way becomes jammed, and its internal parts are sealed together. For instance, a chest cannot be opened, a catapult cannot be fired, and a clock will stop turning. (If there is ever any doubt as to how an object will be impeded, imagine what would happen if glue were poured into all the crevices of the object; the spell should have the same effect.)

#### Final Transmutation

*9th-level transmutation*


- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bar of lead)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

You speak a word of power that transforms a creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is petrified, turning to gold until the spell ends. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

**Ending The Effect.** A petrified target can make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each your turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell, it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed* with the petrified creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

**Damaging A Petrified Creature.** If a petrified creature is physically damaged or broken during this state, it will manifest the same damage upon being reverted to its original form.

**New Condition described at end of the section*

####  Hunting Hound

*5th-level conjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A golden whistle worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Ranger
___

Choose a creature that is familiar to you and that you have seen within the last hour. You then call forth a mechanical hound, which manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. This **hunting hound** uses the stat block below. The hound is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the hound shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The hound disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

**Detecting The Target.** The hound senses the direction to the chosen creature’s location and can see the creature as if it had truesight, as long as the creature is within 1,000 feet of the hound. If the creature is moving, the hound knows the direction of its movement. The hound cannot locate a creature if it is covered in or wearing wolfsbane.

**The Hound's Behavior.** On its turn, the hound moves towards the chosen creature, avoiding any damaging terrain. If it ends its movement more than 5 feet away from the chosen creature, the hound takes the Dash action, moving towards it. If it is within 5 feet of the chosen creature at the end of its movement, the hound takes the Attack action and attacks it. You can give limited commands to the hound (no action required by you) to slow down, stop, return to you, or continue its normal behavior.

If the hound cannot locate the creature, it returns to you. If the creature is dead, it sits by the creature’s remains and follows them if they are moved.

#### Law of Negation

*2nd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A nugget of fool's gold)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger

Choose one non-wondrous magic item you can see within range. The properties and powers of that magic item are suppressed for the duration of the spell—for example, a +1 longsword functions as a nonmagical longsword. If the item is a potion or other consumable, it does nothing upon being consumed. An item under the effect of this spell still counts as a magic item for the purposes of other spells and abilities, such as the *disintegrate* spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional magic item for each slot level above 2nd. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you may choose one wondrous magic item as one of your targets.

At the end of the line, the silver spreads out into a 30-foot cone emanating in the direction of the line. Each creature in the line or cone must make a Dexterity saving throw.

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

On a hit, the target takes 2d4 piercing damage, and the shard embeds in the creature. At the end of the creature's next turn, it takes 2d10 fire damage if the shard is still embedded.

**Removing The Shard.** A creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the shard. On a success, the shard is removed, and on a failure, the shard is still removed, but the creature takes 2d4 slashing damage.

**At Higher Levels.**  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the piercing and slashing damage each increase by 1d4, and the fire damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.




#### Transmutation of Lead

*1st -level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of lead)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour

Additionally, a creature can no longer add its Dexterity modifier to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. If the creature's Strength score is lower than your spell save DC, it has disadvantage on all attacks made with the weapon. If the targeted item is armor, its Strength requirement becomes equal to your spell save DC if it is lower.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional object for each slot level above 1st. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Lore of Shadow
This magic specializes in trickery, illusion, <br> and twisting the minds of its targets.

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

The creature must be no more than one size category larger than you. The spell fails if either of you would appear in a space that cannot accommodate your size.

#### Mystifying Miasma
*2nd-level illusion*

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** the radius of the fog increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

# Fel Dwarf Forces

## Ashragoth Ironfist

Among the daemonsmith-prophets, none have ascended the ruthless hierarchy of the Infernal Priesthood or mastered the blasphemous arts of fel engineering as completely as Ashragoth Ironfist. The oldest living daemonsmith-prophet, he has ruled for centuries, his influence stretching across the fel dwarf empire like an unbreakable chain. His mastery of dark sorcery, malignant machinery, and fanatical devotion to the god of fire have made him a figure of absolute authority. His word is law, his will shaping every aspect of the empire’s relentless expansion.

Yet, for all the power and infamy Ashragoth has amassed, it has come at a terrible cost. Like all daemonsmiths who wield fiendish sorcery, he suffers from the Curse of Stone, a relentless affliction that petrifies his body with each act of dark magic. His limbs have stiffened, his once-boundless arcane might slowly fading. But rather than submit to fate, Ashragoth has turned his suffering into fuel for his ambition. He refuses to be a relic of the past. He will not just endure—he will conquer time itself.

To stave off his encroaching paralysis, Ashragoth has constructed a mechanical exoskeleton, grafting iron prosthetics onto his failing body. Now, he towers over his kin, his metal legs granting him inhuman mobility as he crushes those who dare oppose him beneath his ironbound feet. His mechanical arms, weapons of infernal design, enhance his lethality—one spews torrents of magical flame, turning all in its path to cinders, while the other wields a black-forged hammer burning with eternal heat, capable of melting through armor and shattering steel in a single blow. Even in his weakened state, his command of destructive sorcery remains terrifying, and entire settlements have been reduced to ash in mere minutes by the sorcery he commands.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

Now, Ashragoth moves the fel dwarf empire toward its most ambitious conquest yet. Raiding parties surge beyond the empire’s borders, bolstered by unholy warriors and infernal war engines. Cities fall beneath relentless sieges, their populations dragged away in droves to an unknown fate. Meanwhile, his most trusted agents—champions, enslaved monstrosities, and daemon-forged abominations—scour forgotten tombs and holy sites, seizing long-lost relics to fuel Ashragoth’s ultimate plan.

Back in the heartland of the fel dwarves, an industrial hellscape churns at an unfathomable pace. Mines are stripped bare, heedless of the countless lives spent in the process. Towering factories vomit thick, black smoke into a sky long bereft of sunlight, their forges never ceasing as they churn out esoteric devices of eldritch power. At the center of this chaos looms the Grand Black Tower, Ashragoth’s unholy citadel. Its presence grows stronger with each passing day, spreading a malignant aura across the land like an infection. The very earth quakes beneath it, magma seeping from widening fissures as nameless horrors claw their way from the abyss. It is as if the world itself protests the atrocities being wrought.

Yet, the true purpose of Ashragoth’s great industry remains shrouded in mystery. The few who have escaped his empire speak in hushed whispers of a monolithic device, a creation so blasphemous that all past infernal constructs pale in comparison. What Ashragoth intends to do with this unfathomable machine remains unknown. But one thing is certain—his ambition does not end with regaining his former power, nor even with complete dominion over the fel dwarf Empire. His gaze is fixed on something far greater.

### Ashragoth's Lair
Ashragoth makes his lair in an obsidian tower located within a volcanic wasteland. Within the ziggurat, countless forges and altars are dedicated to the dark gods. The petrified bodies of former pupils and rivals of Ashragoth are embedded within the ramparts of the structure, At the heart of the temple lies Ashragoth’s personal laboratory, where he conducts his own dark experiments.

#### Lair Actions
When fighting within his lair, Ashragoth's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 2.

When Ashragoth rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or the Ashragoth dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 20 and can act of its own accord, always acting in Ashragoth’s best interest. While active in this way, the lair is aware of the location of all creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects. It cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:


**Seismic Tremors.** The lair chooses a 15-foot cube within itself, causing the ground in that area to violently shake. Each creature in the cube must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 13), it cannot stand up until initiative count 20 of the next round. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared, and the tremors persist until initiative count 20 of the next round. At that point, the vibrations culminate in a calamitous burst, forcing all creatures in the area to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6) thunder damage. On a success, it takes half damage.

**Burning Souls.** The lair conjures a 10-foot-radius sphere of burning souls at a point within itself. On initiative count 20 of the next round, the sphere moves up to 30 feet toward the nearest creature before disappearing. Any creature in the sphere when it appears or that the sphere moves into must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and is frightened until initiative count 20 of the next round. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not frightened. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 13), it cannot take reactions and must use the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the sphere by the safest available route.

#### Regional Effects
The area where Ashragoth dwells is corrupted by his presence, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of his lair:
* While in his lair, Ashragoth knows the location of any petrified creatures. As an action, he can choose a petrified creature within this region. For as long as he maintains concentration, he can perceive and speak through the creature.
* Whenever a creature fails to pick a lock, the tools it was using are destroyed, and the creature takes 17 (5d6) fire damage.
* Fires cannot be extinguished except by magical means or by being doused in blood.
* Small earthquakes are common.
* Water sources within 5 miles of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted with sulfur.
* Storms of hot ash are frequent.

These effects gradually dissipate over 1d10 days after Ashragoth's death.


##### Ashragoth Ironfist Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Stolen Furnace:** A massive war machine meant for Ashragoth’s personal use has been stolen by a rogue fel dwarf warband. With both sides hunting them, the party is caught in a deadly conflict over a weapon that could change the course of an impending war.|
|  2  |**The Suspicious Defector:** A high-ranking fel dwarf engineer claims to have grown disillusioned with Ashragoth’s rule and offers to betray his master, promising blueprints to the Grand Black Tower’s infernal war machines. But is this an act of rebellion or a ploy by Ashragoth to lure his enemies into a deadly trap? |
|  3  | **The Devil’s Bargain:** Whispers tell of Ashragoth forging a dark pact with an ancient fiend to stave off his petrification. The devil now demands a price even Ashragoth refuses to pay. The fiend offers the party a chance to strike down the daemonsmith while he is vulnerable—but the cost of aiding such an entity may be even steeper.   |
|  4  | **Doom of the Mountains:** Ashragoth has ordered an entire mountain range mined out to fuel his empire’s endless war machines. The land itself rebels, earthquakes tearing through the region as something ancient stirs beneath. The party is hired to investigate before the fel -Dwarves unearth something that should have remained buried.  |

> On a failed save, Ashragoth gains a level of petrification. After gaining three levels, the levels are removed, and one of his non-petrified limbs is petrified at random (see Limb Actions for descriptions of his limbs). Ashragoth gains a +1 bonus to AC for each petrified limb. If all his limbs become petrified, Ashragoth becomes petrified (ignoring its immunity) until freed by the *greater restoration* spell cast at 9th level.

> ### Limb Actions  
> Ashragoth has three limbs: Harmer Arm, Scorcher Arm, and Piston Legs. Each limb rolls initiative at the start of combat using Ashragoth's initiative modifier and can act independently. A limb cannot use its actions if it is petrified or if Ashragoth is incapacitated.  
> 
> #### Hammer Arm Action  
> **Relentless Pounding.** Ashragoth moves up to 30 feet and then makes an Ashen Hammer attack. If Ashragoth has one petrified limb, he makes two attacks. With two petrified limbs, he makes three attacks.  
> 
> ***Ashen Hammer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage. Ashragoth can choose one of the following effects:  
> &#8226;  The target loses any resistance to fire damage until the end of Ashragoth's next turn, and immunity to fire is treated as resistance instead.  
> &#8226;  The target takes an additional 11 (2d10) fire damage.  
> 
> #### Scorcher Arm Action  
> **Infernal Wave.** Ashragoth moves up to 30 feet and releases fire in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. For each petrified limb Ashragoth has, the cone's length increases by 30 feet and deals an additional 9 (2d8) fire damage.  
> 
> #### Piston Legs Action  
> **Cascade of Iron.** Ashragoth leaps up to 30 feet into the air and slams down into an unoccupied space within 30 feet, ignoring fall damage until the end of his turn. Each creature within 10 feet of the impact must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 9 (2d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a success, it takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone. With one petrified limb, Ashragoth can leap up to 60 feet, and prone targets can't stand unless they use all their movement. With two petrified limbs, it can leap up to 90 feet, and prone targets are dazed*  until the end of their next turn.

### Epic Battle: Prophet of Flame
If you wish to turn the Ashragoth Ironfist into an endgame threat, make the following changes to his stats:

* Increase his Hit Points to 620.
* Change his Consuming Sorcery feature to require 5 levels of petrification before one of his limbs becomes petrified.
* Give him the Dark Father's Power feature descibed below
* Increase his Challenge Rating (CR) to 19.

***Dark Father's Power.*** Once per day, Ashragoth may cast the *eruption** (described in the New Spells section) using his spellcasting ability if he has two or more petrified limbs.



### Ashragoth Ironfist Tactics
Ashragoth's durability is immense, and he generally does not concern himself with taking damage unless it triggers his Consuming Sorcery ability. He only uses Iron Will if he is incapacitated or takes more than 60 damage on a failed save.

Ashragoth can take four actions per turn, which are divided as follows:



#### Limb Actions
* **Hammer Arm.** Prioritizes targets resistant to fire damage.
* **Scorcher Arm.** Aims for the most targets possible, prioritizing enemies with low Dexterity.
* **Piston Legs.** Used to reposition himself. He will seek to land near vulnerable targets such as spellcasters with low Strength. However, if he is close to petrification or low on health, he will use this to jump to safety instead.

\columnbreak

#### Spellcasting
Ashragoth uses his turn to cast spells. As more of his limbs petrify, he gains the ability to concentrate on multiple spells at once. He will attempt to maintain as many different spells as possible, casting them in the following priority order (1 being the highest, 6 the lowest):

**1. Divine Hammer** – Used if it can hit three or more targets. Ashragoth will position the hammer where the most vulnerable targets (those likely to fail their saves) will be directly underneath.

**2. Burning Head** – Placed between himself and enemies to prevent them from spreading out and avoiding his other spells.

**3. Ash Storm** – Used when he can hit at least three targets, or two targets with low Constitution.

**4. Wall of Fire** – Should divide the battlefield roughly in half while hitting at least two targets. Ashragoth can jump over the wall using Iron Cascade, forcing enemies to move through it to reach him.

**5. Conflagration** – Targets a creature with low Dexterity that is at least 30 feet away from any allies.

**6. Magmatic Stone** – Used when he can hit three or more targets, or at least two targets with low Dexterity.

#### Lair Actions

&emsp;**Seismic Tremors:** Use this ability to force opponents out of fortified positions and into unfavorable terrain, such as lava storms created by *magmatic stone* or the fire created by *wall of fire*.

**Burning Souls:** Target the players farthest from Ashragoth to pressure them into moving closer to him. Position the sphere to ensure they move toward Ashragoth, increasing the likelihood that they're forced into his reach.

### Ashragoth Ironfist Loot
Because fel dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Ashragoth Ironfist Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you're running the epic Prophet of Flame version of Ashragoth, use the Prophet of Flame Loot Table to determine the additional valuables the players are able to loot.


##### Ashragoth Ironfist Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |

|  20-24 | 1d6(3) 2,000gp Items |

|  25-26 | 1d6(3) 10,000gp Items |  
|  27+ |  1 20,000gp Item |

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

## Bull Centaurs
*Cruel Half-Bull Half-Dwarf Amalgams*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>

Long ago, when hellish fiends first corrupted the forefathers of the fel dwarfs, they led them down a path of damnation. Some dwarfs, so thoroughly inundated with this insidious essence, had their resilient bodies and spirits utterly crushed. This unholy power fused their broken forms with savage aurochs, birthing the monstrous beings known as bull centaurs.

These nightmares possess the lower body of a muscular bovine and the upper half of a beastly dwarf, complete with large, curved horns jutting from their skulls. They embody the stubbornness and resilience of both bloodlines, combined with a fanatical devotion to the dark entities that fashioned them. Once roused to anger, bull centaurs are nearly unstoppable—hurtling forward with savage momentum, they slam into foes with horns, axes, and hooves, gouging, chopping, and pulverizing flesh.

Despite their massive bulk, bull centaurs strike with brutal precision. They often leave victims barely clinging to life, either to be devoured alive in ritual feasts or dragged to gore-soaked altars to be torn apart in sacrifice.
While some small tribes of bull centaurs roam the wastelands, butchering any they come across as offerings to their dark gods, most have been conscripted into the empires of the fel dwarfs. There, they serve the demon-smith prophets as elite guardians of the most malignant shrines and ziggurats of the dark gods. When the fel dwarfs march to war in great numbers, herds of bull centaurs often stampede at the vanguard, acting as terrifying shock cavalry.

Since their first emergence, only a handful of bull centaurs are born in each generation of fel dwarfs. These rare children are taken from birth and raised by the demon-smith prophets. Yet the limited number of these elite soldiers cannot satisfy the ambitions of their cruel masters.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

In pursuit of greater power, the demon-smiths employ their mastery of forbidden arts, seeking to twist their own children into more bull centaurs to swell their ranks. Most of these unnatural experiments end in agonizing death. Others are kept alive only through accursed concoctions, regularly injected to prolong their misbegotten lives, or through infernal prosthetics grafted onto their malformed, failing bodies.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.

### Bull Centaur Warriors
Armed with massive axes and heavy shields, the rank of Warrior is the most common among their kind. Patrols of these Bull Centaurs can often be found guarding temples within the obsidian cities of the fel dwarves.

### Bull Centaur Renders

More unruly than their brethren, bull centaur renders wield brutal twin axes. They hurl these weapons with ease at fleeing foes who manage to evade their crushing hooves.

### Bull Centaur Guardians
The most disciplined of all bull centaurs are trained to serve as personal bodyguards to the demon-smith prophets. Such is the fierce competition within the dark priesthood that no prophet of high standing can afford to be without these fearsome protectors—lest he be struck down by a jealous rival.

### Bull Centaur Ravagers
Ravagers are more cruel than the rest of their savage kin. These sadistic creatures become intoxicated by the terror and panic they incite. With burning red eyes and ashen skin, they are avatars of horror. Foes who survive the initial charge often break into hysteria, fleeing in desperation—only to feel axes sink into their spines, leaving them helpless before the ravager’s insatiable, sadistic hunger.

### Bull Centaur Khans
Those bull centaurs who possess the greatest cunning and might among their kind rise to become khans—also known as bull lords. These formidable specimens often lead herds of their kin, whether roaming the desolate wilderness or marching within the armies of the fel dwarves. At times, a khan serves directly under a powerful dwarven practitioner, acting as a trusted vassal and executing their master's will without question.

When a khan charges headlong into battle to bring carnage and ruin to the front lines, the minions of darkness are quick to follow. Such stampedes shatter all opposition in their path, leaving only ruin in their wake.

##### Bull Centaur Adventure Hooks
| d12  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Spawn Pit Uprising:** A fel dwarf fortress has gone dark, its forge fires cold and its gates sealed. Whispers speak of an experimental clutch of bull centaur progeny born all at once—mutated, unstable, and violently rebellious. The party is tasked with breaching the citadel to uncover what happened within, but the halls now belong to savage bull centaurs that no longer serve any master.|
| 2   |**The Sanguine Toll:** A remote village sits along an important mountain pass—now blocked by a band of bull centaurs who demand a grisly toll: the blood of one warrior per day, sacrificed at a gore-slick altar. The villagers beg for help, but the bull centaurs claim their offerings are holding something far worse at bay. Can the party stop them—or are the creatures telling the truth?  |
|  3  | **The Prophet’s Bodyguards:** A rising demon-smith prophet has sent emissaries offering terms of surrender to a border kingdom, backed by a show of strength: a pair of bull centaur guardians who now prowl the edges of enemy land. The kingdom hires the party to assassinate or neutralize these elite protectors before the prophet himself arrives to demand fealty—or deliver annihilation.   |
|  4  |**The Tainted Grove:** A sacred grove protected by druids has become twisted and toxic, its spirits slain or driven mad. At the center of the corruption stands a shattered altar repurposed by a band of bull centaur ravagers, who use it to offer grisly sacrifices to their gods. The party must cleanse the land—but slaying the bull centaurs may only anger the gods that empowered them.   |
|  5  |**The Broken Horn Khan:** A notorious bull centaur khan, once thought slain during a siege, has reappeared in the borderlands—now adorned with infernal prosthetics and leading a rogue warband. He no longer answers to the fel dwarves, and his rampages threaten both the empire and its enemies alike. The party is hired to hunt the khan before his forces become an uncontrollable tide of destruction.  |
|  6  |  **The Wandering Herd:** A nomadic tribe of bull centaurs has broken from fel dwarf control and now travels the badlands, seeking to reclaim ancient sites from before their transformation. They are hostile to outsiders but have knowledge of a sealed vault said to contain pre-fall dwarven artifacts. The party can choose to ally with, deceive, or fight the herd—each option leading to vastly different consequences.  |

### Bull Centaur Tactics
#### Bull Centaur Warriors
If the warrior has a clear, straight path to an enemy, it will use its Resolute Charge. If no such path is available, it will stand its ground and fight enemies already in melee range (still using Resolute Charge without moving to gain the Resolute condition).
 
#### Bull Centaur Render
Renders are more adaptable than their kin. If denied a clear charge lane or if enemies keep disengaging, they will stand their ground and throw their twin axes at ranged targets.


#### Bull Centaur Guardian
Guardians typically operate in one of two roles:

**Personal Bodyguard:** Often assigned to protect a powerful spellcaster such as a deamonsmith, the guardian stays close to its charge to grant it its defensive aura. It may reposition itself with a charge if necessary to eliminate isolated threats.


**Group Anchor:** When guarding a formation of other bull centaurs, the guardian charges alongside them to ensure the group benefits from its defensive aura. The group holds formation unless disrupted by sustained area-of-effect attacks.


#### Bull Centaur Ravager
 Ravagers follow similar tactics to renders but prioritize attacking any enemy suffering from the Frightened condition.

#### Bull Centaur Khan
The khan opens combat with Stampede to shatter enemy front lines. Afterwards, it uses tactics similar to standard bull centaur warriors.

### Bull Centaur Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from bull centaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Bone item from a bull centaur could be a Bull Centaur Horn, a 5gp version might be a Young Bull Centaur Horn, and a 20gp version could be an Elite Bull Centaur Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of bull centaurs, Fiendish effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that steal the lives of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.



<br>

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.

## Fel Dwarf Daemonsmiths

In the cruel nations of the fel dwarves, no position commands more influence, power, and reverence than that of the daemonsmith. These dark artisans are few in number, for only those who master fiendish sorcery, science, and earn the favor of the dark gods can attain such authority. The path to becoming a daemonsmith is as brutal as it is unforgiving. Ambitious apprentices subject themselves to the tutelage of a master, seeking to learn blasphemous knowledge. Most are deemed unworthy, and of those accepted, few survive the trials of apprenticeship. Many fall victim to their master’s wrath or the inherent hazards of their craft.

Even once an apprentice rises to the rank of daemonsmith, their position is far from secure. The hierarchy of daemonsmiths is a fractious one, with no singular leader. Each daemonsmith rules their own domain of servants and slaves, consolidating power through conquest, unholy pacts, or fealty to other daemonsmiths and fiendish entities. Yet, despite their pitiless nature, daemonsmiths revere the eldest among them—those who have survived for millennia and earned the title of daemonsmith-prophets. These ancient beings act as direct conduits to the dark gods and wield unparalleled sway within the priesthood's fractured hierarchy.

However, no amount of prestige can save a daemonsmith-prophet or daemonsmith who begins to show weakness. Products of such a ruthless system are terrifying indeed. They form the ruling class of the fel dwarf empires, dominating every aspect of society.

Industry, war, law, and religion all fall under their iron grip. Through merciless ingenuity and singular authority, the fel dwarves have spread their empire unchallenged, constructing towering black fortresses of dark iron, inventing unholy siege engines, and crafting firearms imbued with fiendish power. Their insatiable thirst for dominance knows no moral restraint, as they enslave countless souls to toil in perilous mines or be sacrificed in malevolent rituals.

***On the Battlefield.*** The cunning intellect of the fel dwarves is no less formidable on the battlefield. They call upon terrifying magic to crack and scorch the earth, inspire unfathomable hatred in their allies, and sap the spirit of enemy forces, turning them into listless subordinates. Their mastery of machinery allows them to wield weapons of war with lethal precision, enhancing their destructive capabilities through potent sorcery.

Each daemonsmith arms themselves with the pinnacle of demonic engineering: blood-forged axes, black powder rifles infused with their very souls, and vials of molten liquid that can dissolve metal on contact. However, this immense power comes at a terrible cost. The dark magics they wield are dangerously unwieldy, and any lapse in control can result in a backlash of malignant energy that begins to petrify their bodies. Over time, repeated failures can turn a daemonsmith into a black granite statue, an eternal monument to their hubris.

##### Dark Forged Weapons

Daemonsmiths are masters of constructing hellish weapons. You may choose one of the following properties for each of the dwarf's weapons. (It has Dweomer Leach on its battle axe and Possessed on its pistol by default.)

##### Daemonsmith Weapon effects
| d6  | effect |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Dweomer Leach.*** Creatures making Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell as a result of damage from this weapon have disadvantage on the saving throw. If a creature fails the save, the dwarf regains 5 hit points per level of the spell. |
|  2  | ***Fel Flare.***  The weapon deals an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage on a hit. Additionally, the target loses resistance to fire damage until the end of the dwarf’s next turn. |
|  3  | ***Life Bane.*** On a hit, the weapon curses the target. At the end of each of the cursed creature’s turns, it takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The curse ends if the creature ends its turn more than 60 feet away from the dwarf, if the dwarf dies, or if the cursed creature regains 10 or more hit points. |
| 4 | ***Malignant.*** When the dwarf makes an attack against a creature, it can choose to become obsessed* with that creature until the end of its next turn. If it does, the attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage on a hit. |
|  5  | ***Possessed.*** The weapon deals additional 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on hit, if the dwarf misses or deals no damage on hit, it takes 7 necrotic damage as the weapon hungers for blood.
|  6  | ***Spell-Wrought.*** When the dwarf hits a creature with the weapon, it can channel magic into the attack, dealing an additional 14 (4d6) force damage. If it does, the dwarf has disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration on its Curse of Stone ability until the end of its next turn. |

##### Fel Dwarf Daemonsmith Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Stolen Blueprint.** A young but ambitious fel dwarf daemonsmith has secretly constructed a siege weapon of devastating power—an experimental magma cannon capable of incinerating entire cities. However, the blueprints for the weapon have been stolen by a rival daemonsmith who plans to use them to gain favor with the dark gods. The party is hired—either by the desperate original creator or by one of the faction leaders fearful of this weapon—to infiltrate the rival's stronghold and retrieve or destroy the plans before they are put into production.|
|  2  |**The Petrified Prophet.** A daemonsmith-prophet of immense power has mysteriously succumbed to their final petrification, leaving behind a fortress filled with their unfinished creations, unstable experiments, and enslaved workers. The party is sent to investigate the fortress—either to claim the daemonsmith’s secrets, destroy the dangerous machinery left behind, or rescue survivors. However, the daemonsmith's spirit lingers in the cursed halls, manifesting through their machinery in an attempt to complete their work from beyond death.  |
|  3  | **The Master’s Wrath.** A fel dwarf daemonsmith's apprentice has fled their master’s forge, stealing a powerful artifact in the process. The master has sent mercenaries to recover the artifact and punish the apprentice, but the apprentice seeks refuge with the party or a nearby settlement, offering to share the artifact’s secrets in exchange for protection.   |
|  4  |**War of the Daemonsmiths.** Two rival daemonsmiths are locked in a deadly feud over resources, territory, and the favor of the dark gods. Each has fortified their strongholds with armies, war machines, and fiendish traps, and their conflict is devastating the surrounding lands. The party is caught in the middle of this brutal war and must navigate the conflict, choosing whether to align with one side, manipulate both for their own ends, or find a way to eliminate both daemonsmiths and their war machines.   |
|  5  |**The Breaking of the Chains.** A faction of slaves, including a number of brilliant but oppressed craftsmen, has revolted against their daemonsmith overlord and seized one of their war machines—a massive Iron Demon. The slaves seek to turn the machine against their oppressors, but the daemonsmith has sent their forces, including other war machines, to crush the rebellion.  |
|  6  |  **The Forgotten Outpost.** The players have been hired to explore and loot an abandoned fel dwarf outpost in the frozen north by one of its former guards. While looting the rusted remains and demonically possessed machinery, they encounter a daemonsmith and his retinue who've come to do some off-the-books looting of their own. |

> ***Lore of Magic.*** The dwarf is specialized in one of the following lores of magic: Death, Fel Dwarves, Fire, Shadow, or Metal. The chosen lore determines one of its traits and the spells it knows.
> 
> ***Resolute Stance.*** At the start of the dwarf's turn, it can focus entirely on standing its ground mentally and physically. Until the start of its next turn, any attack roll made against the dwarf has disadvantage. Additionally, the dwarf makes Strength (Athletics) checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage. The dwarf loses this benefit if an effect moves it against its will or knocks it prone. If the dwarf uses this feature, its speed becomes 0 until the end of the current turn.  
> 
> ### Bonus Actions  
> 
> ***War Operator.*** When the dwarf casts a spell, uses the action station of a vehicle, or loads, preps, or fires a siege weapon, it can make one weapon attack.
> 
> ### Actions  
> 
> ***Spellcasting.*** The dwarf is a spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). The spells the dwarf knows depend on the lore of magic it has specialized in, as described in its Lore of Magic trait.  
> 
> ***Dweomer Battleaxe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) slashing damage. Creatures making Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell as a result of damage from this weapon have disadvantage on the saving throw. If a creature fails the save, the dwarf regains 5 hit points per level of the spell.
> 
> ***Life Bane Pistol.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on hit. If the dwarf misses or deals no damage on hit, it takes 7 necrotic damage as the weapon hungers for blood. If the dwarf made a ranged attack, it can’t do so again with this weapon until it loads it as an action or in place of an attack that’s part of an attack action. It can also load it when it uses its Resolute Stance feature (no action required). 
> 
> ***Infuse Weapon.*** The dwarf touches a willing construct, vehicle, or siege weapon and expends a spell slot. The target regains 32 (5d10 + 5) hit points, has advantage on its attack rolls, and imposes disadvantage on any saving throws forced by its effects until the end of its next turn.

### Fel Dwarf Spell Casters Tactics

Fel dwarf spell casters adopt a resolute stance to establish a defensive position, often alongside other ranged attackers or siege weapons. They excel at lobbing spells and using either their pistols or infusing siege weapons. These spell casters do not retreat when engaged in melee combat unless they are overwhelmed, as their low speed and resolute stance improve survivability in close encounters.

#### Fel Dwarf Weapons
Fel dwarf weapons vary in effectiveness based on their type and the situation. The targeting strategy for each weapon is as follows:

**Dweomer Leech** – Targets enemy spell casters concentrating on spells.

**Fel Flare** – Prioritizes creatures with fire resistance.

**Life Ban** – Focuses on hitting as many distinct targets as possible.

**Malignant** – Best used against enemies attempting to engage the dwarf in melee combat.

**Possessed** – Targets the creature with the lowest AC in the group.

**Spell-Wrought** – Used whenever the dwarf has its resolute stance active to give it advantage on saving throws, canceling out the disadvantage from the weapon.

#### Lords of Magic

Fel dwarfs are intelligent and innately understand which spells to cast based on the situation. Spells are prioritized numerically, with 1 being the highest priority.

##### Lore of Death

&emsp; **Life Leech** – Works well with disposable minions, as they can be caught in the area of an AOE spell, enhancing spell effectiveness even if all enemies pass.

**Horrifying Laughter** – Cast on targets with low Wisdom saves, prioritizing the closest one.

**Wind of Death** – Used when it can hit two or more targets or a single target with a low Constitution save.

**Impending Doom** – Targets creatures benefiting from advantage (e.g., Barbarians with Reckless Attack or Rogues with Sneak Attack).

**Aspect of Dread** – Cast when it can frighten three or more targets, prioritizing clustered enemies.

**Crippling Pain** – Used on high-mobility skirmishers such as Monks or Rogues.

**Spirit Leech** – Cast on creatures with low Charisma.

##### Lore of Fel Dwarves

&emsp;**Malevolent Power** – If the dwarf is making four or more saving throws in a round or is one failure away from turning to stone, it drops concentration on its second spell.

**Divine Hammer** – Targets three or more creatures or two in the area where the hammer hits.

**Ash Storm** – Hits three or more targets or those with low Constitution saves.

**Curse of Stone** – Cast on targets with high health and low Constitution.

**Magmatic Stone** – Creates chokepoints or hits three or more enemies.

**Breath of Hatred** – Used to force enemies to focus on unfavorable targets, grant allies advantage, or keep an enemy from fleeing.

**Subjugate** – Targets martial classes directly threatening the dwarf.

##### Lore of Fire

&emsp;**Kindleflame** – The dwarf prioritizes spells against targets with burns.

**Burning Head** – Creates fear in enemies, putting the head between it and its enemies. The bonus action is used to slam the head into a target with burns.

**Burning Bolts** – Targets three or more enemies or two enemies with burns and low Dexterity.

**Wall of Fire** – Blocks enemy movement or hits three or more targets if it has already used Fireball.

**Fireball** – Targets three or more creatures or two with burns/low Dexterity.

**Scorching Ray** – All attacks should be stacked against one creature, as each bolt will apply a burn to the target. This is good for attempting to break concentration on an enemy spellcaster. For Sorcerer-Prophets, this becomes a priority if there is a target with three or more burns; the spell should be upcast to 3rd level.

**Hellish Rebuke** – Reserved for burned targets likely to hit the dwarf.

##### Lore of Shadow

&emsp;**Shadow Paths** – Enables the dwarf to swap positions with allies without breaking its stance, improving survivability.

**Pit of Shadows** – Targets three enemies or two with low Dexterity saves.

**Withering Resolve** – Cast on low Wisdom targets while maintaining concentration.

**Mindrazors** – Used when two or fewer creatures are trapped by Pit of Shadows.

**Penumbral Pendulum** – Targets enemies with low Dexterity and Intelligence or those affected by Withering Resolve.

**Mystifying Miasma** – Effective in chokepoints, hitting multiple enemies.

**Shroud of Dusk** – Cast when it benefits allies but used cautiously to avoid obstructing visibility.

##### Lore of Metal

&emsp;**Metalshifting** – Targets creatures in heavy armor or carrying powerful weapons.

**Blade Barrier** – Placed strategically to hit multiple enemies or block movement.

**Molten Silver** – Focuses on heavily armored enemies with low Dexterity.

**Vitriolic Sphere** – Hits groups or armored foes.

**Plague of Rust** – Weakens enemy armor. If the enemies have a powerful magic weapon such as a +2 weapon, it will target a weapon instead. If there are two or more such weapons being carried by the enemies, it will upcast the spell, making it a priority over 

**Cloud of Daggers** – Effective in narrow chokepoints or against clustered enemies.

### Fel Dwarf Daemonsmith Loot
Because fel dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Fel Dwarf Daemonsmith Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.

## Fel Dwarf Engineers

Fel dwarf engineers are a formidable blend of craftsmen, artificers, and battle strategists. They are responsible for the creation and operation of the race's numerous war machines, including the fearsome Iron Demons and other infernal devices. These engineers view their creations not just as tools, but as manifestations of their veneration for the dark powers they serve. Their unique understanding of the arcane, the mechanical, and the fusion of the two make them exceptionally dangerous on and off the battlefield.

These enginneers possess an uncanny affinity for commanding the infernal spirits bound within their war machines. The construction and binding rituals are jealously guarded secrets, passed down through the generations in a complex tapestry of oral traditions and rune-etched schematics. They use their deep understanding of these forbidden arts to control and unleash their destructive creations with chilling precision.

When using fel dwarf war machines in your games, fel dwarf engineers are ideal for crewing and operating these devices. They will generally fight so long as their machines are operational and flee if they have no war machines on hand they can put to use.

## Fel Dwarf Soldiers

These soldiers are hardened, relentless warriors who form the backbone of the fel dwarf armies, carrying out the will of their dark masters with brutal efficiency. They are twisted fighters shaped by the same dark energies that have corrupted the rest of their kin, making them formidable and ruthless combatants. Clad in sinister armor and wielding weapons crafted from the darkest depths of their infernal forges, fel dwarf soldiers are a diabolic force capable of dominating nearly any foe they face.

On the battlefield, fel dwarves share the stubborn determination of their uncorrupted kin and can adopt resolute stances, allowing them to focus their entire being on withstanding the onslaught of their enemies. This unwavering resolve grants them an uncanny ability to shrug off most attacks and maintain their position, even under the fiercest assaults. However, this defensive posture comes at a cost, as it slows their movement and makes them vulnerable to attacks that require nimbleness to avoid.

The fel dwarf military forces are also known for their debilitating strikes that leave their enemies reeling from the sheer force of their blows. Even if their foes manage to regain their footing, the lingering effects of the strike leave them stunned and vulnerable. This combat technique is vital to the fel dwarves as it allows them to defeat their foes while leaving them alive for capture and enslavement.

> ##### Dwarves with Polarms
> Though dwarves in many fantasy settings traditionally use axes in combat, halberds, and other polearms weapons better complement the tactics dwarves use. Otherwise, they are vulnerable to foes who use reach weapons against them. If you wish to give the dwarves more well-rounded tactical options, you can replace their battle axes with halberds and replace their ***Shield Fighter*** trait with the following trait (only do this for dwarves with shields):<Br>
***Halberd Master.***  The dwarf can wield a halberd in one hand and a shield in the other.

<br>

Overall, these soldiers possess an array of combat skills and abilities that complement each other in combat. Some soldiers specialize in melee combat, wielding wicked axes, maces, or hammers with ruthless precision. Others excel at ranged combat, employing devastating firearms that can lay waste to their enemies from afar. Together they can form nearly unassailable military forces capable of laying waste to any who stand in the way of their implacable march towards conquest.

### Fel Dwarf Warriors

These soldiers are the mainstay of their armies, displaying unwavering loyalty and fierce determination in battle. They are often found on the front lines of fel dwarf forces, ready to face any foe with their cruel battleaxes and sturdy shields. The ring mail they don provides ample protection, while their shields are adorned with dread symbols of their dark allegiance. Like the warriors of their uncorrupted kin, they combine these masterfully crafted armaments with unyielding discipline to become a fighting force to be reckoned with.

Despite being among the lowest-ranking dwarven soldiers in their armies, compared to the warriors of other races, these fel dwarves are still elite infantry. However, their combat prowess is offset by the relatively small population of their race. As such, fel dwarf warriors cannot be fielded in the same numbers as warriors of other races and must often rely on a mass fodder force of indentured soldiers to fill out their numbers. Because of this constant need for more cannon fodder, fel dwarf warriors often engage in raids to capture and conscript new soldiers for their army.

***Burning Beard Warriors.*** These fiery warriors are a rare and fearsome sect of battle-hardened fighters who have delved deep into the secrets of flame, harnessing its destructive power to rain havoc upon their enemies. They are easily recognized by their brass armaments and flaming hair and beards. The burning beards are specialized warriors often found in the ranks of the more ruthless and aggressive dwarf factions, using their mastery of flame to demoralize and devastate their foes.

Their prowess in battle is exemplified by their flaming battleaxes, which emit a searing heat that intensifies when either their target or the warrior is engulfed in flames. This fearsome power can turn the tide of battle as their foes are consumed by the relentless inferno.

When burning beard warriors are able to focus their fury in combat, it manifests as a surge of intense heat that erupts from their very being, igniting any who dare approach. The resulting firestorm serves as a potent deterrent to those who would dare to approach these formidable warriors.

Staying out of range of their attacks proves futile, for most of these dwarves are armed with sinister incendiary devices, which they hurl into crowds of enemies unleashing a devastating inferno that can turn the tide of battle in an instant.

### Fel Dwarf Blunderbussiers
Fel dwarf blunderbussiers are a terrifying <br> sight to behold on the battlefield. Known for their <br> distinctive, oversized firearms, these formidable <br> warriors unleash devastating volleys of fire and <br> shrapnel upon their enemies, their blunderbusses <br> roaring with the force of a miniature artillery <br> barrage.

Crafted in the dark forges of the fel <br> dwarves, these blunderbusses are marvels of <br> dark engineering, combining the dwarven <br> knack for craftsmanship with a cruel, destructive <br> intent. Larger and more potent than the firearms <br> wielded by their kin, these weapons are loaded <br> with a lethal mix of shot, black powder, and <br> arcane substances. When fired, they unleash a <br> devastating cone of destruction, capable of <br> decimating enemy ranks and piercing the <br> strongest armor.

In battle, the blunderbussiers typically form <br> the backbone of the fel Dwarf infantry, <br> positioned behind the ranks of shield-bearing <br> warriors. They unleash coordinated volleys at <br> the command of their overseers, turning tightly <br> packed enemy formations into charnel houses. <br> The sight and sound of their simultaneous discharge, a veritable wall of flame and death, is often enough to break the morale of all but the most steadfast enemies.






\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

But the blunderbussiers are not just marksmen; like all fel dwarves, they are more than capable of holding their own in close-quarters combat. When their blunderbusses are no longer of use, these dwarves can quickly don shields and draw axes to engage foes, and the blunderbussiers are as fearsome and relentless as any of their kin when forced to fight hand-to-hand.

#### The Granite Gunmen
The granite gunmen represent the pinnacle of fel <br> dwarf marksmanship. An elite cadre of blunderbussiers, <br> they are renowned for their unerring accuracy and <br> ruthless precision. Each member of the granite gunmen <br> has honed their skills over decades, if not centuries, of unrelenting warfare, becoming master snipers capable <br> of picking off key targets even amidst the chaotic <br> tumult of battle.

In battle, the granite gunmen are masters of <br> suppressing enemy movement with their precision <br> shots. They focus their fire on key enemy units or <br> individuals, disrupting their movements and forcing <br> them to take cover. The sight of a granite gunman lining <br> up a shot is enough to make any warrior think twice <br> before advancing, such is their fearsome reputation.

The granite gunmen often serves as the personal bodyguards to fel dwarf overseers, providing them <br> with a formidable defensive line. Their ability to slow <br> and disrupt enemy forces proves invaluable in protecting their charges, making them a vital component of any <br> fel dwarf force.
To become a member of the granite gunmen is a great honor, and only the most skilled and dedicated blunderbussiers are considered for this prestigious role. These individuals undergo a grueling selection process, during which they must prove their mettle in a series of trials that test their skill, patience, and resolve.

### Infernal Vanguard

The warriors represent an elite cadre of fel dwarf soldiers in service of their dark masters. These fearsome warriors are bound together by a shared history of past failures, which they seek to atone for through unwavering loyalty, unmatched ferocity, and the merciless conquest of their enemies. The path of the infernal vanguard is one of redemption and suffering, as each member dons an iron mask that obscures their visage, a symbol of their shame and a constant reminder of the debts they must repay.

The iron masks serve not only as a sign of their penance but also as a tool of dehumanization, stripping the infernal vanguard of their individuality and forging them into a single, cohesive unit. Beneath these forbidding masks, the infernal vanguard finds solace in their shared purpose and the brutal path toward atonement they have been provided. In battle, these masks instill fear in the hearts of their enemies, as they come to understand that they face an adversary that is relentless, unforgiving, and without mercy.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

In their quest for redemption, the infernal <br> vanguard is often tasked with carrying out the most <br> dangerous and brutal missions for their dark masters. From leading daring assaults on heavily fortified strongholds to hunting down powerful adversaries deep within enemy territory, the infernal vanguard willingly accepts any challenge, no matter the odds or the cost. For these warriors, each successful mission brings them one step closer to absolution and the eventual removal of their iron masks, a moment of triumph that few among their ranks will ever know.

Encountering the infernal vanguard on the battlefield is a harrowing experience, as their foes must face not only the formidable prowess of these elite warriors but also the relentless determination that drives them. The infernal vanguard will stop at nothing to achieve their objectives and atone for their past failures, and those who stand in their way must be prepared to face the full fury of their wrath.

***Fireglaivadiers.*** Among the ranks of the infernal vanguard, those who are chosen to bear the fire glaives are regarded with a mixture of awe and dread. These fireglaivadiers, as they are known, represent the perfect union of martial prowess and inventive savagery that is the hallmark of the fel dwarves.

Donning their iron masks of atonement, each fireglaivadiers is handpicked for their skill, strength, and utter ruthlessness in battle. They are trained to master the Fire Glaive, a weapon as dangerous to its wielder as it is to the enemy if not handled with the utmost care. 


\columnbreak

Yet, these warriors wield their deadly tools with a seemingly effortless grace, shifting between devastating melee attacks and lethal ranged assaults as the tide of battle demands.

In battle, the fireglaivadiers form the vanguard of the fel dwarf armies, their flaming weapons carving swathes through the enemy ranks. Their presence on the battlefield is a sign of the fel dwarves' determination to achieve victory at any cost. For the fireglaivadiers do not merely fight – they annihilate, leaving nothing but scorched earth and burning wreckage in their wake.

### Infernal Hellsworn
The infernal hellsworn are the most elite members of the infernal vanguard, chosen for their unwavering loyalty, exceptional combat prowess, and unyielding devotion to the cause of their dark masters. Handpicked from the ranks of the infernal vanguard, these warriors are entrusted with the sacred duty of serving as personal soldiers and bodyguards for the highest-ranking fel dwarves, including sorcerer-priests, warlords, and other leaders of their dark society.

Throwable blasting charges are a signature weapon of the infernal hellsworn, a testament to the deadly ingenuity of the fel dwarves. Forged in the dark, magma-filled foundries deep within their subterranean strongholds, these compact and potent explosives combine alchemical prowess with the lethal cunning of their creators. The charges contain a highly volatile concoction of volatile minerals and arcane substances, carefully encased within a rugged iron shell. When hurled at enemies, the blasting charges detonate with devastating force, unleashing a searing wave of flame and shrapnel that can tear through flesh and armor alike.

In their role as protectors of the highest-ranking fel dwarves, the infernal hellsworn are expected to be ever-vigilant, anticipating and neutralizing any threat to their charges before it can manifest. Their keen senses, honed by years of brutal training and the harsh lessons of their past failures, enable them to detect the subtlest signs of danger, allowing them to react with lightning speed to counter any would-be assassins or saboteurs.

### Overseers

Fel dwarf overseers are a distinct and influential caste within their dark society, serving as both slave masters and military generals. These cunning and ruthless individuals wield tremendous power and authority, overseeing the vast legions of slaves and lesser fel dwarves that toil in the name of their malevolent masters.

As slave masters, fel dwarf overseers are responsible for maintaining order and productivity within the sprawling slave workforce that fuels their dark empire. They are masters of manipulation and control, employing a combination of fear, brutality, and martial prowess to keep their thralls in line. In addition to the physical and psychological torment they inflict upon their captives, overseers use their unyielding authority and presence to ensure the unwavering obedience and submission of their slaves.

In their capacity as military generals, fel dwarf overseers are tasked with leading the armies of their dark masters into battle. They are shrewd tacticians and skilled commanders, well-versed in the arts of war and the unique capabilities of their diverse troops. From the disciplined ranks of the infernal vanguard to the rampaging hordes of enslaved creatures, the overseers expertly marshal these forces to achieve their masters' objectives with brutal efficiency.

### Castellans

In the war-bent hierarchy of the fel dwarves, the castellans stand as towering figures of ruthless authority and raw power. These formidable warriors are chosen from the ranks of the infernal ironsword, singled out for their exceptional skill, tactical acumen, and the unyielding force of their will. Clad in the heaviest of armors and wielding their master-crafted fire glaives, the castellans are a sight to both inspire their allies and strike dread into their foes.

The castellans are more than mere captains. They are the embodiment of the fel dwarves' will to dominate, their relentless determination made manifest. Each castellan leads by fearsome example, plunging into the thickest of the melee or holding the line against overwhelming odds. Their presence on the battlefield is a rallying point for their kin, a beacon of unyielding defiance amidst the chaos of battle.

Castellans are bestowed with an ability unique to their rank – the power to infuse their underlings with a burning hatred that fuels their ferocity in battle. This hatred, shaped by the castellan's potent will, ignites their weapons with unholy flame, lending a fiery edge to their every strike. This fearsome power, combined with the castellan's own martial prowess, often turns the tide of battle in favor of the fel dwarves.

In their hands, the fire glaive is not just a weapon, but an instrument of inventive destruction. Castellans use special ammunition to maximize the havoc they wreak upon their enemies. Their molten bullets are not mere projectiles, but searing globes of liquid fire that embed themselves into their targets, burning them from the inside out in a spectacle of gruesome devastation. Even more fearsome are their exploding infernal slugs – projectiles filled with a volatile mixture that detonates upon impact, causing widespread carnage.

>  The target creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check to attempt to remove the bullet. The target creature has disadvantage on the check to remove the bullet from itself. On a success, the bullet is removed, and on a failure, the creature takes 11 (2d10) fire damage.
>
> ***Infernal Slug (3/day).*** When the dwarf loads its fire glaive, it may choose to load it with an infernal slug. When the dwarf makes a ranged weapon attack using this slug, the slug explodes at the target location, regardless of whether it hits or misses the target. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 11 (2d10) fire damage. A creature hit by the attack has disadvantage on the saving throw.

If it was a ranged attack, it deals an additional 5 (1d10) fire damage. If the dwarf made a ranged attack, it can’t do so again with this weapon until it loads it as an action or in place of an attack that’s part of an attack action. It can also load it when it uses its Resolute Stance feature (no action required).
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Infusion of Hatred (3/day).*** The dwarf chooses one other creature it can see within 30 feet of it and infuses it with hatred for the next minute. While infused this way, the first time the creature hits with an attack each turn, it deals additional 5 (1d10) fire damage.

### Fel Dwarf Soldier Loot
Because fel dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Fel Dwarf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Fel Dwarf Infantry Tactics
Fel dwarfs are twisted versions of regular dwarves who possess perverted versions of traditional dwarven traits. Dwarven stubbornness has turned to unrelenting hatred, their love of crafting has been channeled into the creation of weapons of destruction, and their pride now causes them to see all others as beneath them. 

Despite these grotesque changes in attitude, the combat tactics of fel dwarfs differ little from those of their standard kin. They are most effective when occupying a fortified position and using ranged weaponry to batter their enemies from afar while their unyielding melee forces hold the line.

One significant difference in combat strategy stems from their reliance on acquiring forced labor, as fel dwarf society runs on the backs of captured prisoners who are relentlessly worked to death. This means fel dwarves will not be content to drive an enemy off. If an enemy force flees, and the fel dwarves believe they have an overwhelming combat advantage, they will chase down their foes to capture them. 

There are two abilities common to all fel dwarves:

#### Resolute Stance

Dwarves can best use this ability when fighting in confined spaces that don’t require much movement. The optimal scenario involves a mix of ranged and melee dwarf combatants. The ranged dwarves will hunker down behind cover with this ability, making it very difficult to counter them with ranged attacks. They will then have melee dwarfs stand about 5 or 10 feet in front of them to stop anyone who approaches with readied attacks. Dwarves are patient and resilient, so they will tolerate taking fire from enemies this way if it seems like their own ranged attacks are outpacing their enemies’.

If the players bombard fel dwarves with area-of-effect attacks or effects that force saving throws, this may force dwarves out of their defensive position and cause them to charge the players or even flee if they’ve taken heavy damage. Though, many fel dwarves can resist common damage types such as poison and fire, which may allow them to better endure such abilities.

When dwarves use this ability, be sure to communicate it to the players. You can say something to the effect of “the dwarf plants his feet firmly and stares you down, ready for anything that comes at him.”

#### Debilitating Strike

The primary purpose of this ability is to allow fel dwarves to take prisoners of war to serve as forced labor. They will do non-lethal damage when bringing creatures down to 0 hit points, even if they’re fighting a group with a healer. 

#### Fel Dwarf Warriors

Fel Dwarf warriors act as the frontline in battle. When part of a well-balanced army, they generally use the standard fel dwarf tactics described earlier. However, if they are the only type of soldier on the battlefield, they will take one of two tactics depending on the situation.
* If the enemy can attack from range, the dwarfs charge into melee combat, taking the Dash action if needed to get within range. On their next turn, they will take a Resolute stance and fight, forcing their opponent to either fight them in melee with disadvantage or take an opportunity attack to withdraw.
* If the enemy charges the fel dwarf warriors, they will merely hold their position with Resolute Stance and ready attacks for when the enemy comes within reach.

Fel dwarf warriors prioritize attacking targets they can reach while in a Resolute Stance.

##### Burning Beard Warriors

When burning beards are on fire, their attacks deal more damage. Moreover, when they attack an enemy that is already on fire, it causes even more damage. Their main priority is to set as many enemies and other burning beards on fire. There are several ways to achieve this, including:
* If a burning beard is moving towards an enemy and can't quite reach them, they can throw a naphtha bomb that hits the enemy and themselves on the opposite edge of the blast radius.
* If a burning beard is in a resolute stance and doesn't want to move, it may use its naphtha bomb as described above.
* Running into a group of creatures using their burning resolve ability is also quite effective.

####  Blunderbussiers
Blunderbussier tactics are simpler than those of melee fel dwarf infantry, as they only need to find a good vantage point from which to enter a Resolute Srance and start blasting their foes. There are a few factors to keep in mind:
* The blunderbuss is a two-handed weapon, so the dwarf cannot hold a shield while using it.
* The Piercing Rounds ability means that the dwarf will prioritize targets with high AC but low health.
* After each attack with a blunderbuss, the dwarf must either use up its next action to reload it or enter a Resolute Stance at the start of its next turn, which will prevent it from moving. 
* If the dwarf cannot reload its blunderbuss effectively and is caught in melee combat, it will not hesitate to switch to a shield and axe to fight.

##### The Granite Gunmen
These soldiers are even more effective snipers than normal blunderbussiers, though they have no qualms about engaging isolated creatures in melee combat if need be.

One difference in their tactics stems from their Suppressing Fire ability, which makes them more likely to shoot targets that rely on speed, such as rogues.

#### Infernal Vanguards
These are elite dwarven soldiers that fight with unflinching resolve. Their tactics will depend on what they’re armed with.


\pagebreakNum



##### Axemen
These infernal vanguards are just a stronger version of fel dwarf warriors, with the only mechanical difference being that their attacks made with advantage hit even harder. Their tactics are essentially the same as normal fel dwarf warriors. 

##### Fireglaivadiers
Fireglaivadiers are unique in that they have a ranged attack but are more effective in melee combat. There are several attack sequences they can use:

When in a Resolute Stance with an enemy in melee range, they can make both a ranged attack and a melee attack. Since they don't suffer disadvantage from using ranged attacks in melee combat, this is the most effective attack pattern.

When in a Resolute Stance with no enemies nearby, they can only make a single ranged attack. This is useful when defending a position and waiting for enemies to come to them.

If the dwarf is close to a pursuing enemy or slowly retreating, they can make two melee attacks.

When trying to finish off fleeing targets, they can fire their weapon and use their other attack to reload. This is not an optimal attack pattern and should be avoided as possible.


#### Infernal Hellsworn
The main difference between infernal hellsworn and other fel dwarf infantry is their blasting charges. They will usually use their blasting charges when they are being charged, when charging toward an enemy, or if they can hit three or more targets. However, there are two things they must watch out for:

* Enemies within their reach can interrupt the grenade and cause it to detonate on top of the dwarf.
* When throwing the grenade, the dwarf must consider that other dwarves may be hit by the blast. Some dwarves are resistant to fire or outright immune in the case of the infernal ironguard. However, if dwarves caught in the blast are in a resolute stance, they will have disadvantage on the saving throw and likely take the full piercing damage from the blast. Depending on the circumstances, the infernal hellsworn may still opt to use the bombs even if they hit allies.

##### The Immortals
The signature ability of The Immortals is their Undying Will. It's important to note that they start the fight with extra temporary hit points granted by this ability. The Immortals typically begin the fight clustered together and try to bait out area-of-effect spells from the enemy, hoping that it won't deal enough damage to break their Undying Will, and they'll simply regain their lost temporary hit points. They may avoid this tactic if they know the enemy has area-of-effect spells that deal damage other than fire. Once The Immortals have spread out, they use their Undying Will to keep themselves safe while moving into prime positions. They prefer to fight one-on-one, as facing multiple enemies poses a greater risk of damage overcoming their Undying Will.

\columnbreak



#### Fel Dwarf Overseers
Fel dwarf overseers can make their allies more aggressive. They are most effective when the overseer has a mix of cheap expendable units, such as forced laborers and more elite dwarves and warriors.

##### Brutal Motivation
The overseer can use one of his attacks to kill one of his laborers to activate this ability. As long as at least two of his dwarves benefit from it, he will consider it a worthwhile tradeoff. The overseer can also trigger the ability by reducing an enemy to zero hit points, but this is a risky move and should only be done if he’s sure to bring the enemy down.

##### Harsh Discipline
The overseer sends non-dwarf laborers to slow down the enemy before using this ability on his dwarves and any laborers within range. This allows the laborers to better hold their ground and the dwarves to march forward and fight more effectively.

#### Fel Dwarf Castellans
Fel dwarf castellans share most of the techniques used by fireglaivadiers, with a couple of new abilities added to their arsenal:

##### Infusion of Hatred
This enhancement is placed on the most deadly dwarf under the castellan’s command who is not already benefiting from it, and it will use this bonus action every turn during combat. 

##### Specialized Ammunition
The castellan has two specialized bullets that it can fire from its fire glaive and will use them in different ways depending on the spacing of its opponents.

If its enemies are grouped up, it will use Infernal Slugs if it can affect three or more targets with the slug’s blast. Otherwise, it will use Molten Bullets on creatures that are either the most isolated from their allies or concentrating on spells. This can set up a deadly combo as party members attempt to assist each other with pulling out the Molten Bullets, while the castellan can take full advantage of them being near each other to pelt them with Infernal Slugs.


#### Dwarves With Polearms
The variant rule that allows dwarves to use halberds does not change their tactics but improves the already listed tactics, as having reach enables them to use their Resolute Stance more frequently. If you’re using this rule, keep in mind that it does remove the dwarves’ weakness to reach weapons. This is a more realistic tactical choice on their part, but it also gives players few options to counter them.

## Fel Lammasus


Within the darkest reaches of the world, few monstrosities embody as dangerous a blend of bestial might and sorcerous cunning as the lammasu. With the hind legs of a bull and the forelegs of a lion, it sports two massive, leathery wings sprouting from its back. Its most striking feature, however, is its head—a grotesque visage of a male dwarf, warped with sharp teeth, glazed eyes, and a blazing orange beard and mane that blend seamlessly together.

Though the lammasu's sharp claws and long teeth, combined with its muscular body, can easily tear a man to pieces in seconds, it is the creature’s arcane nature and natural guile that one must truly fear. Lammasus wield powerful spells with ease, breathing in the winds of magic and exhaling faint, cold smoke saturated with dark sorcery. This miasmic cloud lingers around the creature, impeding spells that might otherwise end its life and smothering the enchantments of magical weapons and armor, rendering them no more effective than mundane tools.

Despite its lethal arsenal, the lammasu often avoids direct combat, preferring instead to manipulate others into furthering its vile machinations. Though its repulsive appearance might suggest otherwise, lammasus possess innate intelligence and charisma intertwined with their magical nature, allowing them to bend less clever creatures—such as wyverns, griffins, and even tribal humanoids to their will.

Lammasus make their homes in places where the permeations of magic are strongest. Depending on the type of magic saturating a region, a lammasu's appearance and sorcery may be altered. Those dwelling in volcanic craters may have hellish red skin, obsidian claws, and the ability to summon gouts of fire to wash over their foes. Lammasus inhabiting tar pits, graveyards, or other places steeped in death often have gaunt, gray skin and pale white beards that fill mortals with an overwhelming dread of death itself. In the deep caverns and crevices where light is forsaken, lammasus stalk with panther-like coats and gleaming eyes, capable of twisting minds into knots and reducing victims to bewildered invalids. Meanwhile, those that claim abandoned factories or forges, once beacons of great industry, develop brass hides and metallic manes, transforming into monstrosities that can reduce masterwork weapons to cumbersome hunks of lead with a single breath.

Fel dwarves and other practitioners of forbidden arts prize lammasus as mounts of war, using their dark magics in tandem with the creature's own powers. However, while many who seek out a lammasu succeed in capturing one, it is often because the lammasu has deliberately allowed itself to be "tamed." In truth, it slowly manipulates its handler into unwittingly acting in its favor, eventually usurping the would-be master. Some individuals, however, are not so easily outwitted. This leads to a battle of wits between rider and mount, as each attempts to deceitfully bend the other to their will.

### Fel Lammasu Tactics
Fel lammasu are highly intelligent and cautious creatures. They avoid combat unless they have a clear advantage and will flee if threatened. Even when used as mounts, they act independently and in their own best interest.

Their typical strategy is to wait for enemies to group together before swooping in, attacking, and grappling a target to drag it away.

##### Lore of Death Lammasu
* Uses its *fear* spell to scatter enemies
* If a target becomes isolated, it launches a full attack, grapples, and flies away with them
* Uses *crippling breath* to weaken grouped enemies
* Finishes off wounded targets that escape with blight.

##### Lore of Fel Dwarves Lammasu
* Starts with *subjugating breath* to weaken foes
* Uses *magmatic stone* on grouped enemies (the lammasu is immune to fire and pursues foes through the flames)
* If enemies spread out, it grapples an isolated target
* Saves *curse of stone* for the highest HP foe who's not already debuffed

##### Lore of Fire Lammasu
* Uses Breath Weapon on enemies carrying metal weapons
* Weakens armor with *plague of rust*, then attacks and drags a target away
* Uses *searing shard* if its not grappling its chosen victim

\columnbreak

##### Lore of Shadow Lammasu
* Uses its Breath Weapon to scatter enemies
* Casts *withering resolve* on an isolated target, then follows up with *phantasmal killer* for a finishing blow

> ***Magic Resistance.*** The lammasu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  
> 
> ***Sorcerous Miasma.*** The lammasu emits a miasma in a 10-foot emanation. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed while within the miasma. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the miasma or wielded by an attacker in the miasma. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition leaves the miasma (e.g., a magic arrow fired at a target outside the miasma), its magic properties cease to be suppressed as soon as it exits.  
> 
> ### Actions  
> 
> ***Multiattack.*** The lammasu makes two attacks: one with its Bite and one with its Claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the lammasu cannot attack another target.  
> 
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the target is prone, the attack deals 23 (4d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) fire damage instead.  
> 
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the lammasu moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  
> 
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The lammasu is a spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The spells and breath weapon the lammasu knows depend on the lore of magic it has specialized in, as described in its Lore of Magic trait. It requires no material components for its spells.  
> 
> ***Breath Weapon (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** The lammasu exhales its breath weapon, as determined by its Lore of Magic.
>
> ### Bonus Actions

Additionally, a creature can no longer add its Dexterity modifier to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. If the creature's Strength score is lower than 16, it has disadvantage on all attacks made with the weapon. If the targeted item is armor, its Strength requirement becomes 16 if it is lower.

### Fel Lammasu Loot
The valuable items looted from lammasus will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide or beard of a lammasu. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

## Infernal Destroyers

These fiendish creations represent the pinnacle <br> of fel dwarf craftsmanship and their ability to <br> bind demons within machines. Infernal destroyers are massive constructs that stand as titanic embodiments <br> of the fel dwarves' irreverent audacity and relentless pursuit of power. Each infernal destroyer is unique, meticulously designed and crafted by the most skilled fel dwarf engineers and infusors, reflecting the personality, preferences, and ambitions of its creator.

During their creation, a grand ritual of binding is undertaken, calling forth a powerful demon spirit from the chaotic abyss and entrapping it within the cold iron of the construct. This demonic essence provides the machine with a sinister semblance of life and fuels its formidable abilities. The metal of an infernal destroyer is superheated by the trapped spirit, causing it to glow with a fearsome, otherworldly light and scorch the earth it walks upon.

Infernal destroyers can take a variety of forms, from hulking siege machines in the shape of bulls to monstrous constructs with draconic forms and flaming wings capable of decimating entire armies. The exact abilities of a destroyer vary with its form and purpose. Some might be fitted with massive armor, others might devastate their foes with an array of slashing blades across their body, and yet others may shatter foes with mighty charges and fiendish horns.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



Despite their terrifying power, infernal destroyers are not without vulnerabilities. The fiery demon spirits that animate them are a volatile source of power, pushing the metal bodies of the constructs to their limits. If the destroyer has sustained heavy damage and continues to exert itself, the demonic energies within will begin tearing it apart and hindering its ability to operate. Should this process continue unchecked while the destroyer continues to fight, the volatile forces within will eventually destroy it from the inside out. 

Despite this weakness, infernal destroyers can typically win the day for their fel dwarf masters before collapsing. Their masters then quickly recover their remains so they can be repaired and reanimated for their next rampage.

#### Bovine Horns

*This destroyer has been forged in the likeness of a great bull, and if it picks up enough momentum, its horns can shatter mountains.*

When the destroyer makes a Slam attack, it deals extra 13 (2d12) piercing damage on hit for every 20 feet it moved straight toward the target before it hit. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 16), it can't stand up until the start of the destroyer's next turn.

#### Blazing Wings

*The destroyer has been equipped with flaming wings capable of unleashing waves of fire when it lands on the ground.*

The destroyer has a fly speed of 60.

Additionally, if the destroyer is flying and dives at least 20 feet in a straight line before landing on the ground, each other creature standing on the ground within 10 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. 

For each additional 20 feet the destroyer dove before landing, the area of the effect increases by 10 feet, and the damage increases by 9 (2d8).

#### Colossal Plating

*The destroyer has been fitted with large black iron plates welded on either side of its body and etched with unholy runes, which render it nearly indestructible unless they can be removed.*

The destroyer starts with two iron plates attached to it. For each plate attached, it gets +3 to all saving throws and its AC (+6 while both are attached). A creature within 5 feet of the destroyer can use its action to make a DC 21 Strength check to detach one of the plates. It may add its proficiency bonus if it is proficient with Smith's Tools. The creature takes 10(3d6) fire damage when it makes the check if the destroyer's Blazing Body trait is active.

#### Gore Blades

*The destroyer’s body has been covered in razor-sharp blades capable of slicing apart any who draw near.*.

The destroyer's Slam now deals 29 (6d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6) fire damage on hit.

When a creature misses with a melee attack against the destroyer while within 5 feet of it, attempts to grapple it, or starts its turn grappling it, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage. 

Additionally, when a creature moves into or within the area the destroyer is occupying, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

### Infernal Destroyer Loot
Because infernal destroyers are constructs, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Infernal Destroyer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Infernal Destroyer Tactics

Infernal destroyers are mindless monsters, driven solely by their destructive instincts, with little regard for their own survival. They never flee from a fight and will fight to the death. However, their creators can guide their actions and may direct them to execute more complex tactics. If these creators are killed or incapacitated, the destroyer will revert back to its base instincts.

Infernal destroyers serve as hard-hitting shock troopers. Because their Burning Bright feature causes them to become unstable over time and lose attacks as they take damage, their best defense is their offense, hitting with such force that opponents struggle to properly retaliate from the brutal attacks. 

When guided by a more intelligent mind, they may attempt to engage the largest group of enemies to set them ablaze with their Blazing Body feature, focusing all attacks on any targets they believe will resist being burned away by their aura. They may unleash a 'Burning Barrage' to target backline foes, especially those casting dangerous spells. 

Armies with one or more infernal destroyers will follow similar tactics, aiming to hit hard at the beginning of the fight to break their enemies, utilizing all available resources and their strongest spells early in combat before their destroyers run the risk of destabilizing.

Infernal destroyers can be equipped with one of four upgrades that slightly alter their tactics:
* **Blazing Wings:** Allows them to disrupt backline foes by flying past sturdy front liners and slamming into groups of ranged combatants and spellcasters.

* **Colossal Plating:** Turns them into juggernauts, helping them stay alive. Their dwarven allies will focus on impeding whoever is most likely to remove the plating.

* **Gore Blades:** Enables them to shred through swarms of melee enemies, staying in the front line and serving as a blockade to protect more vulnerable creatures fighting alongside the destroyer.

* **Razer Horns:** Enhances their ability to destroy single targets. Fragile damage dealers, such as lightly armored wizards, will be decimated if the destroyer reaches them, and the destroyer is not afraid to take opportunity attacks if it means getting a charge against its intended target.

## Infernal Fireborn
*Burning Demon Souls Bound To Servitude*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Underdark, <br> Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>


Fel dwarves possess an insatiable hunger for power <br> and a ferocious hatred for all beyond their own kind. <br> These traits have driven them to place no trust in, nor offer loyalty to, any being save themselves and their great and terrible gods—whom they follow only in the hope of stealing or coveting some portion of their blasphemous power.

So intense is the urge to dominate that burns within a fel dwarf’s black heart, the notion of serving another fiendish creature is both repugnant and insufferable. Thus, the deamonsmiths of their kind have spent lifetimes delving into the depths of sorcery and science, devising methods to bind and break hellish entities to their will. From this tireless research, the fireborn were brought into existence.

These living weapons of war are forged by fusing a bound demonic spirit into a volatile mixture of molten magma and the boiling blood of sacrificial victims. This unholy compound is then poured into cold bronze suits of armor, etched with countless incantations of binding. The result is a machine given a sinister semblance of life, its formidable abilities fueled by the demonic fire trapped within. The metal of an infernal fireborn glows with an otherworldly light, superheated by the spirit’s fury, and scorches the ground beneath its feet. Armed with searing weapons chained to their very forms, even a small band of fireborn can carve through enemy ranks without pause or fear, obeying every sadistic command of their cruel creators.

Yet for all the fel dwarves' devilish ingenuity, the demonic spirit animating these constructs is far from a stable power source. The imprisoned essence constantly seeks escape. When a fireborn suffers sufficient damage to its frame, the demon within begins tearing its way free, unraveling the construct from the inside. Rebellious flames burst through softened plates, erupting into the open as volcanic rock crumbles to the earth.

Despite this flaw, fireborn are usually able to win the day for their fel dwarf masters before collapsing. Their remains are then swiftly recovered, so that another wicked spirit may be shackled for the next campaign of conquest.

### Infernal Fireborn Tactics
Due to their Burning Bright trait, infernal fireborn function best as hard-hitting shock troopers—overwhelming enemies quickly before their power begins to wane. Their Blazing Body trait makes them most effective when targeting large groups of enemies.

##### Infernal Fireborn Adventure Hooks
| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Broken Frame:** A shattered infernal fireborn lies dormant in a battlefield-turned-graveyard, its armor split open and cold. Recently, scavengers who touched it have gone missing, and strange embers now rise from the wreckage each night. The party is hired to investigate—but the spirit within may not be as dormant as it seems.|
|  2  |**The Blazing Fugitive:** A single fireborn has broken free of its bindings and fled its masters. Now roaming the countryside in a mindless rage, it leaves trails of scorched earth and vaporized militia. The party is sent to destroy or subdue the rogue construct—but others seek to capture it and study how it resisted its creators.  |
|  3  | **The Chains That Burn:** A local noble has secretly acquired an Infernal Fireborn as a trophy. Bound by stolen rituals, it now guards his vault. But the binding is failing, and the party is hired to retrieve a relic locked inside—before the fireborn breaks loose and reduces the manor to molten ruin.|
|  4  |**The Ash March:** A column of fireborn is moving across the wastes without any visible escort or command. Scholars fear the daemonsmith who built them is dead—and that the constructs are now following their last order: to burn everything in their path. The party must find a way to stop or divert the march before it reaches a major settlement.  |

### Infernal Fireborn Loot
Because infernal destroyers are constructs, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

##### Infernal Fireborn Loot (Avg. 66gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 2d6(7) 5gp Items (35gp) |
|  8-10 | 2d4(5) 10gp Items (50gp) | 
|  11-17 | 2d6(7) 10gp Items (70gp) |  
|  18-22 | 1d6(3) 20gp Items (60gp)  |  
|  23+ |  2d4(5) 20gp Items (100gp) |  

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Metal item could be Fireborn Scrap, a 5gp version might be Worn Fireborn Scrap, and a 20gp version could be Masterwork Fireborn Scrap.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. 

Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Infernal Fireborn Materials: 10gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Essense|  Demonic Vapors (Mild/Strong) | 
| 2-4   | Metal|  Fireborn Scrap (Worn/Masterwork) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The **Magic Theme** column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the **Example Descriptor** suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Fiendish magic item effects might drain the life of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Random Magic Ingredients.***
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Infernal Fireborn Magic Themes 
**Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot: 75%**
|1d4 | Magic Theme | Example Descriptor | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-2   | Fiendish| Hellish| 
| 3-4  | Fire | Searing|  


***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

## Infernal Taurus
*Hellish Flying Bulls Formed From Elemental Fire*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Planar (Elemental Plane <br> of Fire), Volcanic; **Treasure:** None <br>
When the winds of pyromantic magic gather and <br> consolidate in an area, destruction soon follows. Fires <br> sweep across the land, leaving only ash and ruin in their wake. The earth trembles, and volcanoes erupt from its tortured crust. Amid such magically wrought calamities, the coalescing powers of pyromancy may give birth to a creature that embodies pure, unrelenting destruction: the Infernal Taurus.

These hellish bovines are stubborn and wrathful, their anger quick to ignite. When provoked, their rage becomes terrifying to behold. As hatred begins to burn within the creature, its charred hide radiates with such heat that iron and steel melt upon contact. It paws the ground with obsidian hooves, sending white-hot sparks flying and branding the land with scorched gouges. Tendrils of dark smoke pour from its flaring nostrils, and its eyes blaze like twin torches. With a beat of massive crimson wings, it streaks through the air like a blazing comet, its brimstone horns skewering and searing all in its path.

Fortunately, these fearsome incarnations wither and crumble to ash within days if deprived of the intense magical heat that birthed them. Thus, they can only endure in places of great fire—scorching deserts, volcanic wastes, or the Plane of Fire itself.

Yet the fel dwarves venerate these beasts for their rage, resilience, and capacity for wanton destruction. Their daemonsmiths construct vast ritual furnaces to sustain the infernal taurus, keeping them compliant and ready to be unleashed upon lush lands ripe for immolation.


Maintaining such brutal power is perilous. The fires that sustain a taurus must be constantly fed with incantations and blood sacrifices. Should the flame falter, the beast's wrath turns upon its keepers. Only the most ambitious and foolhardy warlords dare to make these monsters their mounts, nailing saddles of enchanted brass into their flesh to survive the heat. Such lords are spoken of with dread—for when one of these tyrants rises into the sky upon a blazing bull above the battlefield like a blazing sun, it is a harbinger of doom.

### Baleful Taurus

At the greatest confluence of pyromantic energies, an even more terrible creature is born—the Baleful Taurus. These monsters eclipse even the infernal taurus in their capacity to unleash burning calamity. With its sinewed limbs, it stamps the earth, sending waves of molten rock rippling outward. A single beat of its flame-wreathed wings summons gales of scorching ash that flay skin and blind the unprepared.

The most powerful overseers and daemonsmiths pay dearly in wealth and blood to bind such an embodiment of fire to their will.

### Infernal Taurus Tactics
Infernal taurus are most effective when charging between targets to maximize the use of their Gore and Stomp attacks. They are able to dive bomb targets this way from the sky as an opening move, choosing targets that rely on melee weapons as their preferred targets. Their Resolute feature provides significant benefits, so they will attempt to maintain it whenever possible—even if doing so means attacking suboptimal targets. 

#### Baleful Taurus Tactics
Baleful Taurus are more flexible in combat, able to forgo standard attacks in favor of the following abilities:

**Molten Smash.** This ability is always used if the Taurus can hit three or more targets, or if it failed to knock a creature prone this turn.

**Cinder Gale.** This is favored when there are no optimal targets to charge or if the Taurus is unable to move.

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid. 
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

### Infernal Taurus Loot
Valuable infernal taurus loot typically comes from harvested materials and usually requires a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a **Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools)** check to gather Hide). 

Alternatively, you can roll for loot randomly using a flat modifier.

##### Infernal Taurus Loot (Avg. 550gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 2d4(5) 50gp Items (250gp) |
|  10-13 | 1d6(3) 100gp Items (300gp) | 
|  14-20 | 2d4(5) 100gp Items (500gp) |  
|  21-25 | 1d6(3) 200gp Items (600gp)  |  
|  26+ |  2d6(7) 200gp Items (1,400gp) |  

##### Baleful Taurus Loot (Avg. 1,775gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-10  | 1 500gp Items (500gp) |
|  11-14 | 1 1,000gp Items (1,000gp) | 
|  15-21 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items (2,000gp) |  
|  22-25 | 1 2,000gp Items (2,000gp)  |  
|  26+ |  1d4(2) 2,000gp Items (4,000gp) |  

\columnbreak 

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 100gp Bone item from an infernal taurus could be a Taurus Horn, a 50gp version might be a Cracked Taurus Horn, and a 200gp version could be a Pristine Taurus Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.



##### Infernal Taurus Materials: 100gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Taurus Horn (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2   | Flesh | Taurus Heart (Damaged/Pristine)|  
| 3   | Fluid|  Taurus Blood (Clotted/Thick) |  
| 4  | Hide |Taurus Hide (Tattered/Tough) | 
 

 

##### Baleful Taurus Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|  Baleful Taurus Fang (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2   | Flesh | Baleful Taurus Heart (Damaged/Pristine)|  
| 3   | Fluid| Baleful Taurus Blood (Clotted/Thick) |  
| 4  | Hide | Baleful Taurus Skin (Tattered/Tough) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of infernal taurus, Fire effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that create light, conjure fire spells, or embolden allies.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

## Zhartahn, The Dark
*Dwarven Tyrant of Cruel Domination*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>

In the ash-choked badlands, where once green things grew and flourished and now only the wicked thrive, there rise into the sky a monolith of black whose shadows fall long even through the ashen winds that veil the cursed land in a sorrowful haze. 

If one were to brave those bleak and lifeless wastes, they would come upon a city torn from the dreams of demons and hammered into being by hate—where factories scream horrid songs and foul smoke billows from their roofs, as twisted engines of death are birthed. Great temples of tarnished bronze stand as an affront to all that is sacred, their walls adorned with carved effigies of horned and hideous gods—bovine lords hewn in obsidian, before whom blasphemous rites are offered. And ever above them all rise towers wrought of blackest iron, spearing the smothered sky, where the demon-smiths hold counsel and overlook with pride the hellscape they have wrought.

Yet not in those dread halls are the vilest works performed, but rather far below, in the bowels of the earth itself. There, beneath the streets and furnaces, are the true horrors made manifest. The slave-pits stretch deep into the bones of the world to gather its poisonous wealth, and within them, throngs of broken souls labour without rest, goaded on by cruel taskmasters. And among these, none are more feared than Zhartahn the Dark.

Zhartahn, who hungers for agony, is the most beloved of the priest-smiths, for his cruelty yields vast tribute.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 When his thralls falter, Zhartahn devises fresh torments, crafting pain with as much care as an artist might hew a statue from marble. Thus, the mines flourish beneath his ire, though the life is soon drained from all who toil within.


And when the mines are emptied of strength and the pits echo only with death, Zhartahn rises again with his host of fel warriors, clad in infernal mail and bearing weapons born of hatred and hell. Beyond the blasted lands they march, into the green and living world, that he might bring back new souls to feed the city’s ever-hungering forges. The folk of the fields are taken in chains.
So great is the malice of his tongue, and so heavy the dread in his voice, that even armed hosts falter. Steel stays, and hearts crumble. Many cast down their blades and kneel, pleading for mercy—yet Zhartahn has none to give. Their submission only stokes the fire of his wicked joy.

But those few who resist—who dare to rise against his coming—earn only his wrath. With obsidian axes he carves ruin into their ranks, each stroke a harbinger of pain, each wound a vessel of torment. Even the bravest fall shrieking, their courage undone.
So has it always been. No city, no fortress, no army has yet broken the yoke of Zhartahn. All are brought to heel, and their people bound in service to the black city and the demon-smiths who rule it.

Yet in the shadows of that dread dominion, among the tattered remnants of conquered peoples, there flickers still a spark. Some yet believe that Zhartahn shall one day be met not with fear, but with defiance—that a company of souls, unbent and unbroken, shall rise to end his boundless cruelty.

### Zhartahn & Abarzug's Lair

Zhartahn and Abarzug make their lairs in a fel dwarf garrison tower amid a grand city. Below are miles of volcanic tunnels where all manner of slaves toil under the cruel supervision of armed fel dwarves to harvest valuable minerals. These slaves will fight to the death if commanded to do so, for to die in battle would be a sweet release compared to the punishment that would follow if they refuse the commands of their dark masters.

When fighting within their lair, Zhartahn and Abarzug's Challenge Ratings (CR) increase by 1.

#### Lair Action
When either Zhartahn or Abarzug rolls initiative, their lair awakens to aid them. Until combat ends or both die, the lair has an Intelligence of 16 and can act of its own accord, always acting in the best interest of both. While active in this way, the lair is aware of the location of all creatures within it. On initiative count 0 (losing initiative ties), the lair chooses two Subjugated Workers within it (stat block found after Zhartahn and Abarzug's). They gain 20 temporary hit points for the next minute. While they have these temporary hit points, they are dominated (as described in their stat block) and under the control of the lair.

Whenever a dominated target receives an effect that would end the Frightened or Charmed condition, it loses all of its temporary hit points and ceases to be dominated.

\columnbreak

#### Regional Effects
The area where Zhartahn and Abarzug dwell is corrupted by their presence, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of their lair:

* Whenever a creature hostile to Zhartahn or Abarzug is reduced to 0 hit points within the area, it must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 18.<br>
*Failure:* For the next hour, it cannot cause creatures to be Charmed or Frightened by it, and the creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and saving throws against being Charmed or Frightened.
* Whenever a creature hostile to Zhartahn or Abarzug attempts to telepathically communicate in the area, it must make an *Intelligence Saving Throw:* DC 18.<br>
*Failure:* It takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage and fails to communicate.<br>
*Success:* It can communicate telepathically for the next 10 minutes without having to make a saving throw.
* Water sources within 5 miles of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted with sulfur.
* Storms of hot ash are frequent.



### Epic Battle: Twin Lords of Suffering
If you want to have Zhartahn and Abarzug work together to make a true endgame threat, make the following changes to them and treat them as having a combined Challenge Rating (CR) or 23:

* Whenever Zhartahn or Abarzug gain Cruelty, the other also gains the same amount of Cruelty.
* Whenever Zhartahn or Abarzug dies the other gains five levels of Cruelty

> ### Traits
>
>
> ***Boundless Cruelty.*** At the start of each of Zhartahn’s turns during combat, he gains one level of Cruelty, or two levels if he is Resolute*. He loses all levels of Cruelty when combat ends.
>
> ### Actions
>
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Zhartahn can make two attacks. He can replace one attack with Sadistic Snare.
>
>
> ***Obsidian Axe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit (with advantage if it is an attack of opportunity), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) Slashing damage plus Psychic damage equal to amount Cruelty he has. Zhartahn then gains one level of Cruelty if the target is Frightened or Restrained. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, it is Stunned for 1 minute, and Zhartahn gains three levels of Cruelty.
>
>
> ***Blunderbuss.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit (ignores half and three-quarters cover, and disadvantage from long range while Zhartahn is Resolute*), range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (4d10 + 4) Piercing damage plus Psychic damage equal to amount Cruelty he has, and the target’s speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the end of its next turn. Zhartahn can’t make this attack again until he reloads the weapon as an action or becomes Resolute*.
>
> ***Sadistic Snare (3/Day).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 17, One Large or smaller target Zhartahn can see within 30 feet <br>
> *Failure:* The target is Restrained until the snare is destroyed (AC 18; HP 15; immunity to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage). A creature can take an action to make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check to free itself or another creature in a net within 5 feet, destroying the net on a success. If a creature ends its turn in the net, Zhartahn gains one level of Cruelty.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Resolute Stance.*** At the start of Zhartahn’s turn, he becomes Resolute* until the start of his next turn.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Zhartahn gains two additional actions in combat: Subjugating Order and Tyrant’s Claim. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count, separate from Zhartahn's. On the action's initiative count (losing ties), Zhartahn can take the action if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Subjugating Order (Initiative Count 21).*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 18, two creatures within 60 feet of Zhartahn that were not targeted by this ability during the last round <br>
> *Failure:* The target becomes Frightened of Zhartahn, and Zhartahn gains one level of Cruelty. While Frightened in this way, the target is also Charmed by Zhartahn. The Frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If it fails this saving throw, it falls Prone, and Zhartahn gains one level of Cruelty.
>
> ***Tyrant’s Claim (Initiative Count 1).*** Zhartahn lets loose a claim of his dominance. Any creature within 25 feet of Zhartahn that is not Frightened or Restrained can challenge him. If more than one creature challenges him, he can choose one. Zhartahn or a creature he is mounted on can then move up to 25 feet towards a chosen creature that challenged him, and then Zhartahn makes an attack against that creature, dealing an additional 13 (3d8) slashing damage on hit. If no creature challenges Zhartahn, he gains five levels of Cruelty.
>
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Zhartahn is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Boundless Cruelty.*** At the start of each of Abarzug’s turns during combat, he gains one level of Cruelty. He loses all levels of Cruelty when combat ends.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** Abarzug has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Sorcerous Miasma.*** Abarzug emits a miasma in a 10-foot radius emanating from himself. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed while within the miasma. For example, a +1 longsword in the miasma functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the miasma or wielded by an attacker in the miasma. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition leaves the miasma (e.g., a magic arrow fired at a target outside the miasma), its magic properties cease to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Abarzug makes two attacks: one with his Bite and one with his Claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is Grappled (escape DC 17). Until this Grapple ends, Abarzug cannot use his Bite or Claws against another target.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) Piercing damage plus Psychic damage equal to the number of Cruelty levels Abarzug has. If the target is Prone, the attack deals 23 (4d8 + 5) Piercing damage plus Psychic damage equal to twice the number of Cruelty levels Abarzug has, and Abarzug then gains three levels of Cruelty.
>
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) Slashing damage plus Psychic damage equal to the number of Cruelty levels Abarzug has. If Abarzug moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked Prone.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Abarzug gains two additional actions in combat: Ghastly Prison and Withering Breath. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count, separate from Abarzug's. On the action's initiative count (losing ties), Abarzug can take the action if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Ghastly Prison (Initiative Count 23).*** *Intelligence Saving Throw:* DC 18, two creatures within 60 feet of Abarzug that were not targeted by this ability during the last round <br>
> *Failure:* Abarzug gains one level of Cruelty, and the target becomes sheathed in phantasms. While sheathed in phantasms, the creature is unable to see anything farther than 10 feet away and Abarzug gains one level of Cruelty at the end of each of the creature’s turns. If the creature willingly moves 5 feet or more, it takes 18 (4d8) Psychic damage, and the effect ends. The target can use its action to examine the phantasm by making a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check; if the check succeeds, the target realizes the phantasm is an illusion, and the effect ends.
>
> ***Withering Breath (On Initiative Count 3).*** Abarzug may move up to 25 feet and then force each creature in a 30-foot cone to make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 17.<br>
> *Failure:* Abarzug gains one level of Cruelty, and the creature’s mind becomes filled with doubt until initiative count 1 of the next round. While filled with doubt, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks and saving throws, and attack rolls against it have advantage.
> 
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Abarzug is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

### Zhartahn's Tactics
Zhartahn wins through attrition—growing stronger as the battle drags on and accumulating Cruelty until he can crush his foes.

**Subjugating Order.** Zhartahn targets two creatures with the lowest Wisdom saving throws or highest remaining hit points, aiming to incapacitate and remove them from the fight early.

**Normal Turn Sequence.** Zhartahn begins by using Resolute Stance to prolong his presence on the battlefield and build Cruelty. He then snares the nearest target and follows up with an Obsidian Axe attack. If no enemies are in melee range, he snares a target with low Dexterity and shoots them with his Blunderbuss.

**Tyrant’s Claim.** This ability is reactive and dependent on enemy behavior. Zhartahn can use it to reduce the number of enemies that can challenge him by inflicting Frightened or Restrained conditions, ideally disabling as many opponents as possible.

\columnbreak

### Abarzug's Tactics
Abarzug also fights a war of attrition, using flight to avoid being surrounded and control positioning.

**Ghastly Prison.** Abarzug targets two closely grouped enemies, prioritizing those with low Intelligence saving throws. This limits their ability to spread out and makes them more vulnerable to his Withering Breath.

**Normal Turn Sequence.** Abarzug targets a creature with low Strength, under the effects of Withering Breath, or one that is isolated, and tries to  Grapple it and drag it into a more favorable position.

**Withering Breath.** Abarzug uses this as soon as he can affect multiple enemies. Ideally, his Ghastly Prison and movement on prior turns have maneuvered targets into a tightly packed group for maximum effect.
 
### Subjugated Worker Tactics
The primary goal of the subjugated workers is to help accumulate Cruelty. They attack any targets they can gain advantage against and are considered expendable—often positioned to be struck by Withering Breath to further fuel cruelty gain.

##### Zhartahn, The Dark Adventure Hooks
| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The March of Iron and Smoke:** Zhartahn the Dark has launched a brutal campaign across the borderlands, leading his forces atop Abarzug, whose psychic influence leaves entire garrisons paralyzed with fear before the battle begins. The party is hired by a desperate alliance of frontier lords to assassinate Zhartahn—or find a way to sever the bond between him and the lammasu|
|  2  | **The Burnt Standard:** Zhartahn has defiled a sacred dwarven monument, melting its ancestral runes into slag to forge a new standard for his legion. Now, the spirits of the fallen clans cry for vengeance. The party is enlisted to recover the desecrated relic from the heart of Zhartahn’s war camp |
|  3  | **Chains for the Sun:** Zhartahn has enslaved a fire elemental shrine and forced it to burn perpetually to fuel his forges. Abarzug has taken up residence near the altar, warping the local ley lines with his presence. The area suffers from unnatural eclipses and solar flares. The party is approached by sun priests or elemental guardians who need help purging the shrine and breaking Zhartahn’s hold.|
|  4  |**The Black Procession:** Zhartahn is escorting a caravan of chained prisoners and infernal war machines toward a gate said to lead into the Plane of Fire. He intends to trade the captives—and a secret artifact—to a fiery lord in exchange for a legion of flameborn horrors. The party must intercept the procession before the pact is sealed, or venture into the Plane of Fire to undo it after the fact. |

\pagebreakNum




### Zhartahn's Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from fel dwarves are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. 

Valuable lammasu loot typically comes from harvested materials and usually requires a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a **Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools)** check to gather Hide). 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


##### Zhartahn, The Dark & Abarzug, the Tormenter Loot Table  (Avg. 1,500gp)

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Item |
|  10-13 | 1d4(2) 500gp Items | 
|  14-20 | 1 1,000gp Item  |  
|  21-25 | 1 2,000gp Item |  
|  26+ |  1d4(2) 2,000gp Items |  



### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.



For example, a 1,000gp Bone item from a Zhartahn could be a Tyrant's Trophy Skull, a 500gp version might be a Cracked Tyrant's Trophy Skull, and a 2,000gp version could be a Pristine Tyrant's Trophy Skull.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Zhartahn, The Dark Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Tyrant's Trophy Skull (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2   | Jewelry | Zhartahn's Insigina (Lesser/Greater)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Zhartahn's Armament (Damaged/Masterwork) |  

\columnbreak

##### Abarzug, the Tormenter Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d10 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-2   | Bone|   Abarzug's Horn (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 3-4   | Cloth | Abarzug's Beard (Damaged/Pristine)|  
| 5-6   | Flesh | Abarzug's Heart (Damaged/Pristine)|  
| 7-8   | Fluid|  Abarzug's Blood (Clotted/Thick) |  
| 9-10  | Hide |Abarzug's Hide (Tattered/Tough) | 

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of Zhartahn and Abarzug, Fiendish effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that steal the lives of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.


<br>
 
> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.

# Self-Propelled Vehicles
Most land vehicles in fantasy settings are pulled by other creatures, such as wagons, carriages, or chariots. However, through some combination of technology or magic, some vehicles may be self-propelled and driven by a passenger. These may be relatively small mechanical contraptions, magically self-propelled carriages, or mighty war machines rumbling across blasted battlefields. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these vehicle types in your games. They can be applied to vehicles of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own vehicles. The rules here can be applied to most self-powered vehicles piloted by a passenger. 

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Rules
Self-propelled vehicles are vehicles able to move without needing to be pushed or pulled by another creature, and they usually don’t need an external energy source (such as wind). Throughout this document, they will be referred to simply as vehicles. Creatures within a vehicle are referred to as passengers. 
In combat, vehicles use most of the same rules as creatures, with the following additional considerations:

### Opportunity Attacks
Vehicles provoke opportunity attacks as usual. When a vehicle provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle itself or any creature riding on or inside it, provided they are within reach and do not have total cover.



\columnbreak

### Spacing Within Vehicles
All creatures within a vehicle count as being within 5 feet of each other.


### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Entering or exiting the vehicle costs a creature half of its movement. Each creature inside the vehicle may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting.


### Crashing into Creatures and Objects
A vehicle can crash into a creature or object by entering its space. When it does, the creature or object must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice) using the vehicle's DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved in a straight line before attempting to enter the target's space (maximum 20d6 damage).

If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage and is not knocked prone. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the vehicle's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. A target can only make this saving throw once per turn.

If the vehicle is at least two size categories larger than the target it crashed into, it can continue moving through the target's space if it has any movement remaining. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop. If the target is an impassable object that could reasonably damage the vehicle, such as an iron wall, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6 damage). Each creature on or inside the vehicle takes the damage as well

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/WGybwnz.png' style='position:absolute; top:100px; right:-200px; width:900px; filter:  grayscale(00%) brightness(97%); transform:rotate(0deg)' />

\pagebreakNum

### Prone Vehicles
If vehicle falls prone, it cannot right itself and is incapacitated until it is flipped upright.

### Falling Vehicles
When a vehicle falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position. If the vehicle falls due to the actions of its driver (such as jumping off a ramp) it may not land prone (DM’s discretion) but still takes fall damage.



### Repairing Vehicles
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
Certain circumstances can cause a vehicle to malfunction and eventually break down due to wear and tear. This wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion rules, as described in Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with the following modifications:

* When a vehicle reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
* The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a vehicle is through repair. This can be done using the <br> rules described in the Repairing Vehicles section <br> above. If the attempt to repair the vehicle <br> succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level <br> decreases by 1. If the check fails, the <br> vehicle's exhaustion level remains <br> unchanged, but the repair attempt <br> can be made again using <br> the same tools and <br> replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these vehicles have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A vehicle's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a vehicle's hit points reach 0, it becomes inoperative and is irreparably damaged.
### Damage Threshold
Most vehicles possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A vehicle with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the vehicle takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the vehicle's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the vehicle's hit points.

### Mishap Threshold
When a vehicle sustains damage from a single source that is equal to or exceeds its mishap threshold, it is required to roll on the Mishaps table (refer to the Mishaps section).

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/pZzQTPR/surgehacker-mech.png' style='position:absolute; bottom:-100px; right:-200px; width:1016px; transform:scaleX(-1)' />

\pagebreakNum

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the vehicle comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the vehicle.

### Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity indicates the maximum weight of cargo the vehicle can carry.

### Vehicle DC 
Whenever the vehicle requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ability Scores 
A vehicle possesses the standard six ability scores that creatures have, along with their corresponding modifiers. The Strength of the vehicle is determined by its size and weight, while Dexterity represents its handling and maneuverability. The Constitution of a vehicle reflects its durability and quality of construction. In most cases, vehicles have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a vehicle has a score of 0 in a particular ability score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that relies on that score.

### Action Stations
A vehicle may have one or more Action Stations. Each of these stations requires a certain number of creatures to operate and may grant those creatures some amount of cover. The creatures operating these stations must be passengers within the vehicle, but not all passengers need to be operating a station. A creature operating a station <br> can use an action to activate the station's effect.  <br> A station can be occupied by only one <br> creature at a time and can only <br> be activated once per round. 

\columnbreak

#### The Helm 
Most vehicles that must be piloted by a passenger (referred to as the driver) have an Action Station known as the Helm, where the vehicle's movement is controlled. It usually consists of a chair equipped with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. If a vehicle has a helm with no one operating it, it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver who is proficient with land vehicles can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

The driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring it to a complete stop. While the vehicle is in motion, the driver can steer it along any desired course. If the driver becomes incapacitated, leaves the helm, or takes no action to alter the vehicle's course and speed, the vehicle will continue moving in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it collides with an obstacle large enough to stop its movement.


### Mishaps
Most vehicles have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways its functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishaps Table. 

To resolve a Mishap, a creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (refer to the Mishaps section). If the vehicle is moving, the check is made with disadvantage. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for the repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

\columnbreak

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

# Fel Dwarf War Machines
The fel dwarves are master engineers of dark ingenuity, crafting war machines that fuse brutal industrial might with sorcery. These infernal engines, powered by rune-bound steam and chaos-forged metals, form the backbone of their campaigns. From mobile siege platforms to fire-spewing monstrosities, their machines devastate armies, crush fortresses, and spread terror wherever they tread.

## Iron Demons

The iron demons are hulking, locomotive-like vehicles that epitomize fel dwarf ingenuity. By default, these armored leviathans serve as unarmed transports, towing artillery, ferrying troops, or hauling supplies across hostile terrain. Their modular design, however, allows fel dwarves to affix a range of siege weapons, transforming iron demons into adaptable tools of destruction.

Fueled by rune-etched steam engines that belch black smoke, iron demons are clad in obsidian and infernal iron, making them near-impervious to harm. 

\columnbreak



When outfitted, they can carry devastating artillery, flame-spewing cannons, or brutal siege rams to batter enemy fortifications and infantry alike. Some are customized for long-range bombardment, while others focus on close-range carnage.

***Bound Demonic Spirits.*** The most fearsome iron demons incorporate bound demonic spirits into their engines. These entities grant the machine magical potency and malign sentience, turning them into autonomous instruments of destruction. Yet this power comes with risk: if the crew is slain or the runes weaken, the bound spirit can break free, causing the iron demon to rampage uncontrollably and attack all in its path.

***The Relentless Advance.*** Iron demons often lead fel dwarf assaults, towing siege engines into firing positions while shrugging off attacks. Their heavy plating ensures they advance with grim inevitability, the roar of their engines and clanging of metal a harbinger of doom.

Beyond the battlefield, iron demons serve as laboring titans, hauling ore, supplies, and war machines through the fel dwarves' bleak domains. To see one dragging its infernal cargo across a scorched landscape is to witness the ceaseless march of fel dwarf industry and the inevitability of their conquest.

### Hellbound Iron Demon Variant
You can create a variant of the iron demon that possesses an incorporeal demonic entity trapped within it, attempting to break free from the control of its masters. The Iron Demon has the following changes:

- It has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10.
- If it fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, it may choose to succeed on the save and roll on the mishap table instead. It cannot do this if the save was caused by the spell *dispel evil and good* or similar magic that ends a possession. In this case, a failed save results in the Iron Demon losing all its hellbound traits as the demonic spirit is expelled.
- It counts as a fiend for the purposes of features such as a paladin’s Divine Smite or a ranger’s Primeval Awareness.
- If it would roll for a mishap, instead each creature inside the Iron Demon must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The Iron Demon regains hit points equal to the total necrotic damage dealt. If this reduces a humanoid creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies, and its death gives the demonic spirit enough power to break free.

While free, the iron demon rolls initiative and takes its own turn. No creature can use any of its action stations while the spirit is free. On its turn, the iron demon can use the Helm action even if no creature is at the helm.


### Siege Weapons
An iron demon may have a fell iron weapon built into it. These siege weapons share the iron demon's hit points, AC, and damage threshold, and are destroyed when the iron demon is destroyed. These weapons have their own action station that provides three-quarters cover to the operators. Any member in the action station can load, prep, or fire the siege weapon. The weapons cannot be used if the Iron Demon is prone.

You may attach a possessed fell iron weapon to the iron demon. If the weapon would suffer a mishap, the iron demon instead suffers the mishap, using the normal vehicle mishap table.

## Burning Steam Cannon
The burning steam cannon is the most common and feared siege weapon mounted on iron demons. These massive cannons harness infernal steam pressure and fel-forged runes to launch enormous, flaming cannonballs across vast distances. Each projectile explodes on impact, engulfing the surrounding area in fire and molten shrapnel, reducing enemy ranks, fortifications, and war machines to smoldering ruin. The cannons’ engines roar with an unholy heat, their barrels glowing red-hot as black smoke billows into the sky, choking the battlefield. Though devastating, the burning steam cannon requires constant maintenance, as its immense power risks rupturing the weapon or overheating the iron demon itself. Nonetheless, its reliability and sheer destructive force make it the weapon of choice for breaking enemy lines and bombarding cities from afar—an unmistakable symbol of Fel Dwarven dominance.

Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage and 22 (4d10) fire damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

## Deathscreecher Rockets

The deathscreecher rocket is a dreaded fel dwarf siege weapon capable of unleashing specialized rockets across vast distances, spreading destruction and despair. The most infamous of these are the cursed rockets, vile munitions that imprison malevolent fire spirits within rune-bound warheads. As these rockets soar through the air, they emit ghastly, soul-piercing shrieks that echo across the battlefield, filling those who hear them with maddening terror. Upon impact, the spirits are violently unleashed, erupting into unnatural flames that consume both flesh and soul, leaving behind nothing but blackened ruin and despair.

In contrast, the demolition rockets prioritize brutal, mechanical devastation. Crafted with sharp, rune-forged tips, these rockets drill deep into their targets before their delayed explosives detonate with earth-shattering force. Capable of collapsing fortifications, shattering siege engines, or obliterating other high value targets, demolition rockets are precise tools of annihilation. Together, these two variants ensure the deathscreecher rocket’s reputation as a weapon that not only crushes its enemies physically but breaks their spirits long before the battle’s end.

## Doomquake Mortar
The doomquake mortar is a monumental siege weapon and a testament to the fel dwarves' mastery of destructive engineering. These colossal mortars are loaded with earth-breaker shells, massive munitions painstakingly crafted by fel dwarf demonsmiths and imbued with fiendish energy. Each shell is so cumbersome and difficult to handle that powerful creatures, such as enslaved ogres, are often pressed into service as part of the weapon’s crew. Loading and firing the mortar is a grueling, laborious process, but the devastation it brings is well worth the effort.

When fired, the doomquake mortar unleashes an earth-shaking detonation, hurling its payload in a fiery arc across the battlefield. Upon impact, the earth-breaker shell erupts with unholy energy that tortures the ground itself, causing violent shockwaves and explosive convulsions. The terrain fractures and collapses beneath its victims, swallowing soldiers, pulverizing war machines, and shattering fortifications in a cascade of destruction. Those who survive the initial blast often find themselves trapped in unstable craters or buried beneath rubble, as the battlefield itself becomes a nightmarish quagmire of ruin. The doomquake mortar is not merely a weapon but a cataclysm unleashed, leaving no doubt of the fel dwarves' relentless hunger for annihilation.

## Magma Cannon

The magma cannon is a fearsome fel dwarf siege weapon that turns raw metal into a torrent of molten death. Loaded with heavy chunks of metal ore, the cannon’s infernal machinery melts them down within its rune-forged chamber, superheating the material until it reaches a liquid, blazing state. When fired, the weapon belches forth a pressurized stream of molten metal that surges across the battlefield like a fiery tidal wave. Upon impact, the scalding payload detonates violently, erupting into explosive sprays of liquid metal that cling to anything in range—flesh, stone, and steel alike. Those caught within the blast are horrifically burned, their bodies seared to the bone, while armor and fortifications warp and buckle under the heat. The magma cannon is as much a tool of terror as it is destruction, its fiery onslaught leaving entire enemy ranks reduced to charred husks and molten slag—a grim testament to the fel dwarves' mastery over fire and metal.

Each creature in the cone must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (6d10) fire damage and ignites. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't ignited. Until a creature uses an action to douse the fire, an ignited creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

## Possessed Variants
You can create a variant of the weapon, which possesses an incorporeal demonic entity trapped within it that attempts to break free from the control of its masters. Its Challenge Rating (CR) is increased by 1, and it has the following changes:

- It has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores of 10.
- If it fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, it may choose to succeed on the save and roll on the mishap table instead. It cannot do this if the save was caused by the spell *dispel evil and good* or similar magic that ends a possession. In this case, a failed save results in the weapon losing all its possessed traits as the demonic spirit is expelled.
- The weapon no longer needs to be Prepped.
- It counts as a fiend when determining the effects of features such as a paladin’s Divine Smite or a ranger’s Primeval Awareness.
- When the weapon fires, roll 1d6. On a 1, the weapon does not fire, and it must roll on the Mishap Table. If the weapon has half its hit points or fewer, it rolls for a mishap on a 1, 2, or 3.


##### Possessed Weapon Mishap Table

Until the end of the user’s next turn, any creature that tries to cast a spell of 1st level or higher within 300 feet of the weapon must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) force damage per level of the spell, and the spell is wasted. |
| 3   | Essence Siphon    | The weapon feeds on the soul of the creature that fired it. That creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. The weapon regains hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt. |
| 4   | Mental Slash      | The weapon exerts terror on nearby minds. Each creature within 15 feet of the weapon must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened until the end of the user’s next turn. While frightened, the creature cannot take reactions and must use its turn to take the Dash action and move away from the weapon by the safest available route. |
| 5   | Unstable Blast    | The weapon fires as normal, but all creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw against its effect. The weapon then takes 27 (5d10) force damage. |
| 6   | Free at Last      | The weapon explodes, destroying itself. Each creature within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. |

### Iron Demon Tactics
Iron demons are usually accompanied by fel dwarf engineers. They serve as hard-hitting chariots capable of smashing through weak battle lines, utilizing their high speed to circle the opposing force and charge in and out of combat to get the most damage out of their Siege Engine ability. They can use any siege weapons attached to soften up targets and cut off paths of retreat.

### Siege Weapon Tactics

Here are some differences between how the different types of siege weaponry are typically used in battle.

#### Burning Steam Cannon & Magma Cannon
**Function:** These are close-range artillery pieces designed to obliterate grouped enemies.<br>
**Best Targets:** Clumped enemies with low Dexterity.

#### Deathscreecher Rocket
**Function:** A versatile rocket launcher with two distinct ammunition types.<br>
* **Dread Fire Rocket:** 
    * Use when it can hit three or more targets or at least two targets with low Wisdom.
    * Use to frighten enemies within 60 feet of the cannon.
    * Beware of flames are placed as they can move to nearby allies if they are too close.
* **Demolition Rocket:** 
    * Use in all other scenarios.

#### Doomquake Mortar 
**Function:** Long-range artillery designed to devastate large groups or control the battlefield.<br>
**Tactics:** 
* Target large groups of enemies, particularly those with:
    * Low mobility (movement speed less than 30 feet).
    * Difficulty navigating difficult terrain.
* Secondary Use:
    * Create barriers by targeting key pathways to slow enemy advancements and retreat.

## War Machine Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from war machines are items they were carrying or materials salvaged from their remains. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks or may not require a check to spot at all. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### War Machine Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
