# Tomb Kingdom Compendium

In the heart of a vast and merciless desert, hidden by relentless sandstorms and mirages, lie the remnants of a once-grand civilization: the Tomb Kingdoms. These ancient lands are etched with the memory of a forgotten empire, where colossal statues of deities and kings gaze emptily across the dunes, and monumental pyramids break the horizon's flat line, a testament to the past glory and the architectural prowess of its people.

The Tomb Kingdoms, as the scholars of the neighboring realms refer to them, are shrouded in mystery and the whispers of curses long past. These were the domains where death was but a doorway to eternity, where rulers were gods in their own right, commanding great power and reverence. Their obsession with immortality led them to construct vast necropolises, a complex labyrinth of tombs and mortuary temples, designed to secure their place in the afterlife.

But death in the Tomb Kingdoms was never the end. Through dark rituals and forbidden pacts, tomb priests, the keepers of ancient secrets, learned to bind their souls and those of their kings to their mortal remains, achieving a twisted semblance of eternal life. 


\columnbreak

Now, with the aid of the priests, the ancient rulers of old oversee legions of undead, maintaining order within the sun-beaten walls and desolate courtyards. The vast desert is their domain, and they guard it with a possessive zeal, dispatching their skeletal armies and titanic constructs to ward off the curious and the covetous. 

Venture forth into the heart of the Tomb Kingdoms, and you will find a land of eternal undeath. Here, the living are not welcome, and the dead do not rest. It is a place where treasures beyond imagining lie side by side with dangers that threaten not just the body, but the soul. Only the bravest or most foolish would dare to uncover the secrets of the Tomb Kingdoms, for what is buried in these sands refuses to fade into history.

This document provides content to help you run games that heavily feature the denizens of the Tomb Kingdoms. This content ranges from new spells used by the spellcasters of their domain, to rules for implementing the types of combat equipment they use, to a bestiary of the different creatures that can be found in their legions. Whether the players only have a minor side quest featuring Tomb Kingdoms or an entire campaign, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

# Running Tomb Kingdom Adventures 

The tomb kingdoms are all that remain of an ancient empire that had grown so powerful it believed it could conquer death. The egos of this empire's pharaohs were such that they could not accept the prospect of their end or that of their kingdom. Thus, incalculable resources went into the study of necromantic magics and the construction of massive statues and necropolises meant to immortalize their kingdom. The rulers of these realms have been preserved along with their armies, and they seek to reclaim the lost glory of their kingdom.

Players are most likely to come into conflict with denizens of the tomb kingdoms while exploring the lands they once ruled. The tombs, temples, and vaults of the tomb kingdoms all make for excellent adventuring locations that pit the players against these eternal warriors. The players may also encounter tomb kingdom forces outside their homes if they are seeking to reclaim lost treasure or exact vengeance on any who earned their ire.


### Tomb Kingdom Motivations


***Tomb Lords.*** The royal lords of the tomb kingdoms are egotistical and self-righteous, with most believing that their empires and territory were given to them by divine right. Tomb lords may adhere to ancient governmental or religious codes. Their behavior may also be dictated by the nature of the magic that caused them to awaken. In all these cases, the tomb lord may behave contrary to its best interest to adhere to these codes or magical compulsions. 

When bringing a tomb lord into your world, you can use these codes of conduct to shape its personality and behavior. A tomb lord may fanatically focus the wrath of its minions on anyone who defaces its sacred monuments, even if they’re not the soundest tactical target. A different tomb lord may be honor-bound to accept duals from a challenging player. Another tomb lord may have awoken from its slumber specifically to exact vengeance on someone who stole a treasure. These quirks can make your tomb lord more memorable and give players personal weaknesses to learn and exploit.

***Tomb Kingdom Minions.*** The motivations of most tomb kingdom minions are fairly straightforward. They exist to serve their kingdom and carry out the will of their undying lords. Most have specific duties they were assigned in ages past, and barring intervention from a tomb lord, they will carry out these duties to the best of their ability.

#### Tomb Kingdom Motivations
* Punish trespassers
* Reclaim lost treasures
* Carry out last received orders
* Reclaim territory formerly held in life
* Exact vengeance for past grievances
* Gather knowledge of necromantic arts
* Rebuild ruined structures or statues
* Carry out wishes of a patron deity

\columnbreak

### Tomb Kingdom Tactics
The armies of the tomb kingdoms are varied, and their tactics will depend on their goals, the environment, and what creatures they have at their disposal. Still, there are some commonalities between many of their creatures. Skeleton warriors are used en masse to distract or overwhelm players, but their methods of attack are usually straightforward. The large construct monsters provide much heavier hitting forces, each serving a more specialized role that can be combined with the more general-purpose skeletons. The leaders of the tomb kingdoms are powerful in their own right, but they rely on their minions to truly shine, each possessing spells or abilities that enhance other undead.

#### Engagement

Most tomb kingdom creatures either lie in wait beneath the sands, or they can appear indistinguishable from inanimate statues. This means tomb kingdom creatures will generally attempt ambushes whenever possible. They are patient and will usually wait to attack until they are spotted or they have the opportunity to attack from an advantageous position. 
When an ambush isn't possible, tomb kingdom creatures march implacably after the players, letting nothing deter them from their goal.

#### Combat

Tomb kingdom creatures and implacable and utterly focused on their objectives in combat. While the exact tactics of each creature vary, the discipline with which the creatures execute their tactics does not. The sophistication and adaptability of different creatures depend on the level of sentience of the highest-ranking creature there. Skeletons acting without a leader may execute their techniques without fail, but they aren't very adaptable. 

When using leaderless statues and low-level soldiers, have them execute their standard tactics and fight to the death regardless of changes to the situation. Leadership from tomb pharaohs, priests, or nobles can allow them to adapt to changing circumstances more easily and better counter whatever the players are attempting.

#### Retreat
Tomb kingdom creatures are entirely fearless and utterly devoted to following any orders given to them. They will never lose their morale or flee and will only retreat when ordered to. The kings and priests may flee to save themselves, but they are unlikely to panic, and many will stubbornly fight to the end if they feel the stakes are high enough. A tomb kingdom ruler who is forced to retreat will undoubtedly hold a grudge and likely seek vengeance in the future, even if it takes years.

# New Player Options

## New Spells

### Lore of Death

This brand of magic plays on the nature of mortality and fragility of life, though it is strictly distinct from traditional necromancy, as it embraces the inevitability of death rather than attempting to deny it. Its users can manipulate negative energy, sap the vitality of foes, and instill mortal terror in those around them. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Death often wield.

#### Aspect of Dread
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A white feather)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Crippling Pain
*3rd-level necromancy*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. 



\columnbreak

<br>

On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn.On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Horrifying Laughter
*6th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Wizard
___

You target a creature you can see within range, causing it to collapse into debilitating fits of deranged laughter. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less aren't affected.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration, any creature within 30 feet of the laughing creature that can hear the laughter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the laughing creature until the end of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it stabilizes but remains laughing and can no longer attempt saving throws against the spell. If the spell ends while the creature has 0 hit points, it dies.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Impending Doom 
*4th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black feather)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

####  Purple Sun
*9th-level transmutation*

- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a grim sphere of purple light at a point you designate within range. The sphere has a maximum radius of 60 feet and illuminates its area with dim light.

Any creature that either enters the sphere's area for the first time on its turn or begins its turn inside the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified for the duration. At the end of <br> each of its turns, the target can make another <br> Constitution saving throw. On a success, the <br> spell ends on the target. However, if a creature <br> accumulates three failed saves against this <br> spell (including the initial failed save), it <br> remains petrified indefinitely until the <br> condition is cured by other means.

If a petrified creature is physically <br> damaged or broken during this state, it <br> will manifest the same damage upon <br> being reverted to its original form.

## Lore of <Br> Tomb Priests
This ancient lore of magic was <br> developed by the tomb priests of <br> the long-gone Tomb Kingdom <br> empire. The undying tomb priests <br> are still its primary practitioners, but <br> the secrets of this lore have slipped out <br> into the hands of other desert peoples <br> and arcane archeologists. Its magic <br> focuses on incantations designed to bolster <br> the effectiveness of soldiers, magic that <br> harnesses the power of the desert, and curses <br> that conjure the underworld spirits and punish <br> trespassers. The following spells are examples <br> of the types of magic users of the Lore of <br> Tomb Priests often wield.

#### Cursed Blades

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S

You imbue a weapon within range with the essence of death. When this weapon hits a creature, the target becomes cursed for the spell's duration. At the start of your turn, each creature cursed this way within 90 feet of you takes 1d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional weapon for each slot level above 1st. Using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher increases the damage by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You attempt to drain the vitality of a creature within range, leaving it feeble and vulnerable. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and its Strength and Dexterity scores reduced to 1. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Constitution saving throw, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration becomes 24 hours and the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a short or long rest. If you use an 8th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled and no longer requires Concentration; the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a long rest.

## Lore of Light
This magic taps into the power of light and its <br> many aspects. Its users not only conjure literal <br> light but can ignite the light in the souls of others, <br> healing or inspiring them. Some magic from this lore <br> even blesses creatures with the ability to move at light <br> speed. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Light often wield.

Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 radiant damage on a failed save. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6, the radiant damage increases by 1d6, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

A burst of divine light emanates from you, enveloping all creatures within 30 feet. Each creature in this area must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 3d6 + your Wisdom modifier radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

You and up to four creatures of your choice within the area automatically succeed on this saving throw, taking no damage. Instead, you and the chosen creatures are bathed in the healing radiance, regaining hit points equal to the total radiant damage dealt.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Mass Haste
*8th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose up to six willing creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, each chosen creature has its speed doubled, gains a +2 bonus to AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and is quickened.


#### Net of Light

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (A white thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Should a creature inside the web attempt to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. A successful save allows the creature to utilize its spell or ability to exit the web, while a failure causes the spell or ability to be expended without effect. Notably, this net of light also extends into the Ethereal Plane, preventing ethereal escape.

A restrained creature can take an action on its turn to attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending its restrained condition on a success.

#### Warding Light

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (sliver coin)
- **Duration:**  1 round.

___

You envelop a creature of your choice within range in a protective radiant light. Until the start of your next turn, the creature illuminates bright light out to a 10-foot radius and dim light out an additional 10 feet. During this time, attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage. This effect doesn't hinder attackers who don't depend on sight, such as those with blindsight or those who cannot be blinded.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. The chosen creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Lore of Shadow
This magic specializes in trickery, illusion, <br> and twisting the minds of its targets. Its <br> users primarily rely on illusory magic, though <br> they also wield spells that manipulate shadows <br> and even the nature of space and time as others <br> are able to perceive it, constantly leaving their <br> foes seconding guessing what they're seeing. <br> The following spells are examples of the types <br> of magic users of the Lore of Shadow often wield.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

#### Mirror Dance

> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

The creature must be no more than one size category larger than you. The spell fails if either of you would appear in a space that cannot accommodate your size.

___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 

This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

___

You conjure a spectral pendulum that swings through a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, and 5-foot-tall line of your choice within range. Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard
___

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil. On a failed save, for the duration of the spell, the target has disadvantage on all checks and saving throws not triggered by this spell, and attack rolls against it have advantage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

## Tomb Kingdom <br> Magic Items

The priests and artisans of Tomb Kingdoms produced countless magical items during their empire's heyday. These relics now linger in the crumbling ruins dotted throughout their realm. Many leaders among the Tomb Kingdoms call upon the ancient power of these items when they awaken for battle, and this power is sought after by adventurers throughout the world.

The following magic items can be used to represent some of the magical items players may come across while encountering the Tomb Kingdoms in their adventures.


#### Amulet of Nullification
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement), 5,000gp*<br>
While wearing this amulet, all magic items within 5 ft. of you are subjected to the effects of the *antimagic field* spell. This effect also applies to magic items being worn or carried by creatures within 5 ft. of you.

#### Collar of The Exalted
*Wondrous item, very rare, 6,000gp*<br>
This collar was worn by only the most worthy of leaders who gladly threw away their followers' lives to save their own.

When you take damage while wearing this collar, you can use your reaction to choose a willing creature within 10 feet to take the damage instead. The damage that the creature takes can't be negated or resisted in any way.



#### Hieratic Jar 
*Wondrous item, varies*<br>

These canopic jars were used by the tomb priests of the Tomb Kingdoms to store the remains of their deceased peers, from which they could draw upon magic the dead spellcaster knew in life.

After performing a 10-minute ritual, you can store the remains of a creature within this jar. The jar can only store the remains of one creature at a time. If the creature could cast spells in life, choose one of its spells of 1st level or higher that can be cast as an action or bonus action and does not require components consumed by the spell. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

While the jar holds these remains, you can cast the chosen spell by using an action to open the lid (which can be done as part of any somatic components the spell may have.) After casting the spell, if the remains belong to a creature that was hostile to you or recognized you as an enemy in life, the creature's lingering animosity forces you to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to maintain control of its remains. On a failure, the remains are destroyed by the corrosive resentment of the former creature. 

Once a spell has been cast from the jar, it can't be used in this manner again until the next dawn.

Some rare versions of this jar can contain more potent spells and may have a higher spell saving throw DC and attack bonus. These jars also have higher saving throw DCs to contain the power of a resentful creature's remains.



##### Hieratic Jar Levels
|Max Spell Level  | Save DC for Spells and the Jar| Spell Attack Bonus | Rarity | Cost (gp) |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:| :---------:|  :---------:|
|  1  | 13 | +5| Uncommon |  1,000 |
|  2  | 13 | +5| Rare |  1,200 |

\pagebreakNum

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word
*Scroll, very rare, 640 gp* <br>
As a reaction to seeing a spell being cast with a verbal component, you can draw this scroll and read its incantations in an attempt to prevent its casting. The caster must make a concentration saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fails and has no effect as the caster's mouth is filled with biting scarabs, which deal 1d8 piercing damage per level of the spell that was being cast and prevent the caster from speaking until the start of their next turn.

#### Spell Bane Canopic Jar
*Wondrous item, varies*<br>
This canopic jar contains the remains of a high tomb priest who jealously wished to stamp out all magic beyond his own.

As an action, you can open the lid of the kanopi, causing it to emit a swirling vortex that attempts to absorb any magic in the area. Every creature, object, and magical effect with 30 ft. is subjected to the effects of *dispel magic*. Spells caught in this area that are higher than 3rd level are unaffected. For every 2 effects dispelled this way, you can regain a 1st level spell slot.

Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until dawn of the following day.

Some rarer kanpoi can provide more potent effects, allowing them to dispel more powerful effects and grant their users higher-level spell slots.

##### Spell Bane Canopic Jar Levels
| Level of *Dispel Magic* Effect  | Level of Spell Slots Regained| Rarity | Cost (gp) |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:| :---------:|
|  3  | 1 | Rare | 2,600 | 
|  4  | 2 | Rare | 4,400 |
|  5  | 2 | Very Rare | 7,600 |
|  6  | 3 | Very Rare | 14,800 |
|  7  | 3 | Very Rare | 27,600 |
|  8  | 4 | Legendary | 54,400 |
|  9  | 4 | Legendary | 105,600 |


#### Staff of the Grand Hierophant

*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 2,000gp*

This ancient staff is inscribed with the names of ancient gods, granting its wielder enhanced mastery over magical energies.

While holding the staff and casting a spell that requires concentration, you can allow a willing creature within 60 feet of you that you can see to also concentrate on that spell. The spell won't end if you lose concentration, provided the other creature maintains its concentration. However, the assisting creature will lose concentration if:

* It moves 60 or more feet away from you
* It loses line of sight with you
* You begin concentrating on a different spell

#### Vambraces of the Sun
*Wondrous item, uncommon, 1,000gp*<br>
This pair of bracers are blessed by an ancient sun god, and each is marked with a jeweled sun emblem capable of releasing a ray of blinding light. 


When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing bracers to shoot a flash of light at the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature. Each bracer can use this ability once (allowing you two uses in total) and can't do so again until dawn of the next day.

# Tomb <br> Kingdom Legions

## Ark of Damnation
In the sprawling necropolises of the Tomb Kingdoms, ancient secrets are kept hidden from the prying eyes of the world. Among the most fearsome of these enigmas are the arks of damnation. Nestled deep in the heart of the grandest tombs, these artifacts are not only a testament to the Tomb Kingdoms' arcane prowess but also a symbol of their unforgiving justice.

The appearance of an ark of damnation is truly awe-inspiring. Carved from a single slab of onyx, the ark is adorned with hieroglyphs depicting scenes of eternal torment and divine judgment. On its lid rests golden effigies of vultures, representing the Tomb Kingdom god of the dead watching over the ark to ensure the souls within cannot escape.

Inside, the ark serves as a prison for the souls of those who dared defy or displease the mighty rulers and priests of the Tomb Kingdoms. Instead of granting them the honor of joining their ancestors in the afterlife, these unfortunate beings are condemned to an eternity of torment within the ark, their spirits never to find rest.

When the Tomb Kingdoms march to war, the ark doesn't remain behind. A dedicated priest attendant conjures forth the ark from its resting place to the battlefield. With practiced precision and dark incantations, the priest attendant can momentarily unlock the ark. 

\columnbreak

<br><Br><br>

As the lid creaks open, vengeful souls pour out like a tempestuous wind, hungry for release and retribution. Directed by the will of the attendant, these souls sweep through the enemy ranks, withering those they touch and tearing the very essence from their victims. Once their brief freedom ends, the attendant's incantations pull them back into their dark prison, along with the new souls they've claimed.

Such is the power emanating from the ark of damnation that it distorts the very fabric of magic around it. Mages and sorcerers find their spells dissipating or going awry in the artifact's presence. However, with another whispered incantation, the priest attendant can twist this disruption, amplifying the magical prowess of their allies while still hindering their foes.

But woe betide those who believe they can simply destroy the ark and end its threat. If shattered, the built-up wrath and pain of millennia burst forth. Freed souls, in their final moments of liberation, lash out in a blinding frenzy, consuming everything in their path before dissipating into the ether, finally finding the peace denied to them for so long.

In the ever-shifting sands of time, many artifacts and relics are lost or forgotten. But the ark of damnation, and the dread they inspire, ensure that the dread power of the Tomb Kingdoms will never be overlooked or underestimated.

### Ark of Damnation Mechanics

The ark of damnation is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the ark if it has proficiency in the Religion skill and both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 14 or higher. 

A creature attuned to the ark can perform a minute-long ritual to summon it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat an ark of damnation with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

#### Unleashing the Souls

The creature attuned to the ark of damnation and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the tormented souls within, targeting a creature it can see within 300 feet. The souls can then jump to another creature within 15 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 15 feet of that one. A creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per turn. A targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If a creature fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) or if the damage from this ability reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the ark begins extracting the target's soul. This effect ends if the ark is destroyed. The affected creature repeats the saving throw at the start of the ark user's next turn, with disadvantage if it has 0 hit points. On a success, the effect ends. If the creature fails, it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the ark until the ark is destroyed. While a creature's soul is trapped this way, it can't be resurrected.

#### Arcane Conduit

Additionally, creatures within 150 feet of the ark have a -1 penalty to their spell save DC and spell attack rolls. The creature attuned to the ark can choose for a creature to receive a +1 bonus instead. This modifier remains even if the creature attuned to the ark dies.

#### The Ark's Destruction

If the ark of souls is destroyed, the trapped souls are freed and lash out at all nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the ark must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

## Bone Colossi

Though these mighty beings appear to be the skeletons of enormous giants, they are, in fact, constructs carved from wood and stone. In ancient times, they were created as monumental tributes to legendary kings and heroes. As the death priests learned to bind souls and manipulate the death, they began binding powerful spirits to these statues. These spirits remain dormant for ages at a time until they are called upon to serve their lost kingdom. 

When they're stirred into action, cone colossi draw huge bows and unleash blessed arrows the size of a ballista bolt capable. Even those who manage to overcome the sheer terror of the bone colossus's presence and engage it in close quarters will still need to contend with melee attacks capable of pulverizing most humanoids in a single blow. And those who survive long enough to land a blow will be unlikely to overcome the defenses of its nearly indestructible frame.

>
> ***Sacred Arrows.*** The bone colossus's ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
>
> ***Sleeping Giant.*** While the bone colossus remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue. It is also immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as to all divination spells or other magic that would detect it is a creature. 
>
> ***Turning Defiance.***  The bone colossus has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the bone colossus's choice that is within 120 feet of the bone colossus and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the bone colossus's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

### Bone Colossus Tactics
Though bone colossi are huge and capable of smashing through enemies, they prefer staying at a range, picking off targets with their bow of the desert. Their huge range and high speed mean they can even kite players if they have enough space to move and shoot. They’ll set up their attacks to allow their piercing shots to potentially hit multiple targets in the event they reduce the first target to 0 hit points. Their Frightful Presence ability is also useful for keeping players at bay. It will switch to melee attacks if enough players overcome its Frightful Presence and manage to close into melee range. 

Bone colossi are very patient and will remain motionless if they’re undetected, even if the players do something that would incur their wrath. They will often wait to make their presence known until the players have left the area, and which point they can use their speed to catch up to their foes and start sniping them from a distance. 

### Bone Colossus Loot
The valuable items looted from bone colossi will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Bone Colossus Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Bone Colossus Loot Table

## Dread Carrion
In the shadowed dunes and desolate plains of the eternal desert lie the remnants of the once-glorious Tomb Kingdoms. These vast lands are inhabited not only by the buried undead legions but also by the chilling specters of the skies: the dread carrion.

Dread carrion are monstrous, reanimated vultures bearing an unholy union of decayed flesh and preserved remains. The scale of these creatures is intimidating, with wingspans reaching that of several men laid end to end. Their desiccated skin clings tightly to their skeletal form, and their lifeless eyes gleam with an eerie light, signaling the dark magic that reanimates them.

\columnbreak

In days of old, the giant carrion vultures were revered creatures, considered sacred to the denizens of the Tomb Kingdoms. Seen as messengers and intermediaries between the mortal realm and the heavens, they were embalmed upon their death and preserved with archaic rituals. Thus, the vast necropolises of the empire, home to its departed rulers and warriors, became the resting place for countless such vultures.

The Tomb Kingdoms may have been long silent, but they are far from lifeless. The powerful tomb priests, guardians of ancient rituals and forbidden magics, possess the capability to awaken the embalmed vultures. Summoned forth from their aeons of slumber, the dread Carrion soar the skies once more, providing invaluable aerial support to the ground-bound legions of the undead.

These creatures are not mere tools of war. They are deadly hunters of the arid desert, preying on wanderers and creatures already enfeebled by the scorching sun and relentless sandstorms. With dread inevitability, they descend upon the vulnerable, leaving little but bones in their wake.

But the dread carrion have evolved beyond mere talons and beaks as weapons. Through the dark rituals that bind them, they've gained the ability to spew forth a vile, necrotic filth. This foul substance weakens their prey, sapping them of strength and vitality, rendering them all the easier to subdue.

Among the dread carrion, there are those that stand a class apart. These are the blessed ones, chosen by the very gods of the Tomb Kingdoms. These sacred creatures are not only larger and more formidable, but they also possess the unique ability to release torrents of necrotic filth from high above. Like unholy bombers, they soar the heavens, raining down decay and death upon the enemies of the Tomb Kingdoms.

The dread carrion are a testament to the enduring might and dark majesty of the Tomb Kingdoms. As long as the tomb priests chant their spells and the necropolises stand, these creatures of dread will continue to haunt the desert skies, symbols of an empire that refuses to fade into the annals of history.

### Dread Carrion Tactics
These vulturous undead specialize in harrying their prey and picking off the weak. 

When operating independently, dread carrion will track down desert-traveling players suffering from exhaustion and attempt to swoop in to finish them off. They usually initiate with their Spew Filth and then focus their attacks on whoever has the most levels of exhaustion. They will typically stop their attacks to use Feast whenever the opportunity presents itself.

When working with other Tomb Kingdom forces, they will harass and weaken players, focusing on which ever player the other Tomb Kingdom forces may be having the most trouble reaching. They are also good at helping Tomb Kingdom forces catch fleeing foes.

The sacred carrion fight in much the same way as their other kin. The biggest difference is that they have Filth Bombardment rather than Spew Filth. This ability allows sacred carrion to weaken their prey from afar before having to move in closer, where they risk facing stronger counterattacks.

## Dread Sphinxes

The dread sphinxes stand as awe-inspiring yet feared creations. These formidable constructs are an amalgamation of the deadliest creatures from the mythos of the Tomb Kingdoms. They possess the lion-like bodies characteristic of sphinxes, but their forms are further adorned with an array of other animal and humanoid aspects, making them appear as if conjured from a nightmarish vision. Most striking are their arcane wings, which serve a dual purpose; not only do these wings allow the dread sphinxes to soar through the skies, but their edges are honed into massive, blade-like extensions. Additionally, these behemoths often boast giant scorpion stinger tails, capable of delivering a lethal blow to any who dare challenge them.

The creation of dread sphinxes was driven by a desire to embody the pinnacle of predatory might. However, their bizarre and terrifying visages led many pharaohs and priests to view them as blasphemous abominations. It was feared that these constructs, with their amalgamated forms, would incur the wrath of malevolent gods. As a result, the dread sphinxes were buried deep beneath the sands, their existence relegated to whispers and warnings, forgotten by time.

Yet, in moments of dire need, a tomb pharaoh or liche priest might resurrect one of these unholy titans to unleash its fury upon their foes. The most potent binding magics are employed in their awakening, for it is widely believed that the dread sphinxes are not animated by the souls of departed champions but by the will of malevolent deities. Their insatiable lust for destruction is legendary, and a lingering fear persists that, should their bindings falter, the dread sphinxes would turn their wrath upon the Tomb Kingdoms themselves, leaving a trail of ruin in their wake.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

In battle, the dread sphinxes are a sight of both terror and majesty. They glide through the chaos of war on wings of stone and metal, striking with the force of a tempest. Their approach heralds doom as they crash into enemy ranks with thunderous impact, their stingers paralyzing prey with deadly precision. With a swift and brutal swing of their bladed wings, they decapitate the mightiest of enemies, spreading fear and awe in equal measure. 

### The Underworld Butcher

This particular dread sphinx stands apart from its kin, not merely for its monstrous form and the terror it inspires, but for the dark legends surrounding its nature. It is said that within this colossal construct stirs the spirit of a god, one so ruthless and bloodthirsty that it was banished to the Underworld by its divine peers. This god’s lingering spirit, filled with eternal rage and thirst for vengeance, animates The Underworld Butcher, turning it into an avatar of destruction, a herald of the Underworld’s fury unleashed upon the lands of the living.

The Underworld Butcher is a terror in battle, its massive, blade-like wings engulfed in the cursed fires of the Underworld. These hellish flames are no mere spectacle; they are a manifestation of the Butcher's unyielding rage, growing more intense and ferocious with every life it claims. The more creatures that fall beneath its sweeping blades, the brighter and more terrifying the flames become, scorching the earth and air around it. It is whispered that the fires possess a cursed property, dooming those touched by them to a fate worse than death - their souls cast down to the Underworld, fueling the Butcher’s infernal power.

If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 10) or automatically fails, the target is decapitated if the attack hits.

On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. A creature poisoned this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success.

> 
> ***Decapitating Strike (1/Turn).*** When the sphinx makes a Blade attack against a creature, it can choose for it to be a Decapitating Strike, forcing the target to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw before the attack roll is made. If it fails, the attack roll has advantage, and if it hits, it is a critical hit. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 12) or automatically fails, the target is decapitated if the attack hits. If the damage is somehow reduced by 10 or more, the target is Gargantuan, or has Legendary Actions, it is not decapitated.

If the sphinx hits a creature with two or more hit dice, the fire damage dealt by subsequent Blade attacks is increased by 3 (1d6). This ability can stack up to 15 times and can only gain up to 3 stacks in a single turn. The sphinx loses all the damage increases after 1 minute without striking any targets with more than two hit dice.

> 
> The sphinx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sphinx regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
> 
> ***Blade Rush.*** The sphinx may move up to half its speed without provoking attacks of opportunity. At the end of the movement, it may then make a Blade attack against the creature that just took its turn, dealing 12 (1d10 + 7) slashing damage instead of its normal Slashing damage (it still deals its normal Fire damage).
>
> ***Check.*** The sphinx makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
> 
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the sphinx is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
> 
> ***Consuming Flame (Costs 3 Actions).*** The sphinx lets loose a wave of cleansing fire within 120 feet of it, passing through all magical barriers and destroying them. Each creature in the area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 17), any spells it has cast affecting the area or creatures within it immediately end.

### Dread Sphinx Tactics
Dread sphinxes are giant, straightforward killing machines. When they see a large group of targets, they'll dive in with their Impact Tremor. They will then choose a prime target for decapitation and target it with a Sting attack before following up with their Blade attack. Their preferred targets are the ones with the most health, such as barbarians, paladins, and fighters.

#### The Underworld Butcher
The biggest tactical difference with this sphinx is its new legendary actions. It will use its Blade Rush legendary action to help build up stacks of fire damage on its Blade attacks. If there are multiple enemy spells that all have a combined spell level of approximately 9 or higher, it will use all its legendary actions to use Consuming Flame to attempt to dispel them all.

### Dread Sphinx Loot
The valuable items looted from dread sphinxes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Dread Sphinx Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Dune Stalkers
In the vast, sun-scorched expanses of the Tomb Kingdoms, the dune stalkers stand as silent, lethal protectors of the realm's borders. These enigmatic constructs, part serpent, part warrior, are a fearsome sight to behold. Towering over men, they possess the sinuous bodies of serpents, seamlessly blending into the desert sands, while their upper bodies are those of men, crowned with dread, skull-like visages. The stalkers move with the deadly grace of a serpent while wielding deadly glaives with the skill of veteran warriors.

**Creation of the Dune Stalkers.** Dune stalkers are born from a combination of necessity and arcane prowess. When a veteran warrior of the Tomb Kingdoms falls in battle, and their body is damaged beyond repair, the liche priests may choose to grant the solider a new form of unlife. Through elaborate ceremonies, these priests transfer the warrior's spirit into a specially crafted statue, giving birth to a dune stalker. This process allows the fallen warrior to continue their service, granting them a fearsome and enduring form.

**Guardians of the Pharaoh's Domain.** Tasked with guarding the borders of their tomb pharaoh's territory, dune stalkers are masters of stealth and ambush. With the ability to burrow silently through the sands, they lie in wait beneath the dunes, undetectable to the unwary traveler or invader. When the time for attack comes, they erupt from beneath the sands in a sudden, terrifying assault, using their glaives to dispatch foes with swift precision.

**The Gaze of Petrification.** Perhaps the most dreaded aspect of these guardians is their gaze. Legends say that those who lock eyes with a dune stalker are transformed into statues of sand, their forms left to be scattered and lost amidst the desert winds. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This fearsome ability has given rise to various tales and strategies among tomb raiders and warriors; some speculate that the use of a reflective surface could turn this deadly gaze back upon the dune stalker itself.

### Eyes of the Desert
A unique and even more formidable breed of dune stalkers known as the Eyes of the Desert commands terror and paranoia among those who dare face them. These exceptional guardians possess a cunning and deceptive ability that sets them apart: they can create a simulacrum of themselves, a duplicate crafted from the very sands they patrol. This sand-formed doppelganger possesses the same martial prowess as the original, wielding its glaive with lethal efficiency. However, it lacks the petrifying gaze of its creator.

The creation of these sand duplicates is more than just a display of combat might; it is a sophisticated strategy of psychological warfare. Enemies find themselves in a treacherous game of guessing and second-guessing as they try to discern the true stalker from its simulacrum. Direct observation of the duplicate reveals its sandy nature, but this realization comes with a perilous risk. For if one mistakenly meets the gaze of the true dune stalker, thinking it to be the copy, they fall victim to its terrifying, petrifying power. Thus, the Eyes of the Desert not only dominate the physical battlefield but also the minds of their foes, turning engagements into a deadly dance of illusion, cunning, and raw power.

### Dune Stalker Tactics
Domb stalkers are ambush fighters who either use their burrowing abilities or False Appearance trait to catch foes by surprise and hit them with their Transmogrifying Gaze. At the end of each of its turns, the stalker will burrow underground, then pop out to attack any player that is either restrained by its gaze or has chosen not to avert its gaze.

#### Eyes of the Desert Tactics
The Living Mirage ability allows these stalkers to play mind games with their foes. There are many ways to use this ability, but there are a couple of tactics to keep in mind:

* The stalker never ambushes with its Living Mirage active, as a creature would be forced to look at it and realize it's a fake. It waits until creatures can choose whether they will look at it and its copy before using the ability.

* The stalker and its double stay near each other, and at the end of each of their turns, they will attempt to burrow back under the ground, moving to different positions. This means that every time one of them emerges from the ground, its opponents will have to guess whether it's the double or the real one. The stalker should switch up each round, varying whether the copy takes its turn before or after the real one so as not to become predictable.

### Dune Stalker Loot
The valuable items looted from dune stalkers will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Dune Stalkers Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Dune Swarms
In the unforgiving sands of the desert and the echoing silence of ancient crypts, a menace lurks unseen. A creeping, crawling, writhing menace emerges from the very ground to consume and annihilate those who dare to trespass on the sacred grounds of the Tomb Kingdoms.

Dune swarms resemble a horrifying cascade of skeletal and desiccated small desert creatures, moving as one, with the sole intent of overwhelming their prey. From a distance, they might appear like shifting sands, but upon closer inspection, one can discern the countless creatures that form these swarms, their tiny bones, carapaces, and withered forms glistening under the desert sun or the dim torchlight of a crypt.

***Swarm Composition.*** Comprised of a myriad of smaller undead beings, dune swarms are most notably made up of scarabs and scorpions, though various other small creatures might be found within the mix. Each creature, though small and seemingly insignificant on its own, becomes a formidable force when part of the swarm.


\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

The scarabs are especially feared for their gruesome method of attack, burrowing into the flesh of their unfortunate victims. Once inside, they consume their prey from the inside out, causing immense pain and inevitable death.

The undead scorpions inject a potent necrotic venom with each sting. The poison not only causes excruciating pain but also debilitates the victim, making counterattacks nearly impossible.

***Deadly Ambushers.*** The dune swarms do not exist by mere chance. They are animated by the ambient magic wielded by the tomb priests of the Tomb Kingdoms. In combat, these swarms serve as perfect ambushers, bursting forth from beneath the sands or creeping out of shadowed crypt corners, taking enemies by surprise. 

With an appetite that seems insatiable, dune swarms will skeletonize their surprised prey. The speed at which they devour flesh and bone is unnatural, leaving behind only empty armor and weapons, a grim testament to their efficiency.

### Dune Swarm Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these undead beasts in your games:

##### Dune Swarm Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Scarab Gem:** An infamous gem, said to be cursed, resurfaces in the market. Anyone who possesses it is found dead, their body grotesquely skeletonized. The adventurers are tasked with tracing the gem's origin and dealing with dune swarms it summons.|
|  2  |**Lost to the Swarm:** An earlier expedition into the Tomb Kingdoms has not returned. The adventurers are tasked with finding them. As they explore deeper into the ancient ruins, they find evidence of the expedition's encounters with dune swarms.  |
|  3  | **Master of the Swarm:** A rogue necromancer seeks to control the dune swarms for their own nefarious goals. As they conduct dark rituals to bend the swarms to their will, the adventurers must intervene, navigating through the chaos of swarming undead.  |
|  4  | **The Desiccated Oasis:** A once-lush oasis is now completely dry. Those who ventured to investigate never returned. But their last messages spoke of the ground awakening with swarming undead creatures.|

### Dune Swarm Tactics
Dune swarms are made up of a mass of mindless undead creatures acting with just enough collective intelligence to maintain a unified cohesion as they hunt. Beyond this, they are mindless in their tactics. They remain hidden in crevasses or underground until they detect prey, then they burst forth for a surprise attack. They focus on attacking the closest prey available, using their numbers to overwhelm and devour their victim.

When in the service of the tomb kingdoms, they act as ambushers designed to surprise and distract high-priority targets such as spell casters.

\columnbreak

### Dune Swarm Loot

## The Grand Hierophant

In the dim mists of antiquity, when the Tomb Kingdoms still brimmed with life, there arose a sage of unparalleled prowess, known today as the Grand Hierophant. As time withered ancient stones, his name grew synonymous with the enigmatic might of the Tomb Kingdoms.

The Grand Hierophant was the pioneering beacon amongst the tomb priests, the first to decipher the esoteric rites of eternal existence, transcending mortality to ascend into undeath. His physique is a haunting mirage of his former self; a desiccated skeletal form draped in opulent, tattered robes, symbolic of his age and wisdom. An ornate staff, crowned with a shimmering gem, proclaims his exalted station. His eye sockets, though devoid of life, glint with an eerie, otherworldly glow, hinting at the vast knowledge and power trapped within.

However, power often invites hubris. With the fall of the Tomb Kingdoms and their subsequent resurrection, the inability of the tomb priests to fully restore their once grand civilization was seen as a grievous failure. The Grand Hierophant, as the paragon of their order, bore the brunt of this blame. Thus, a great irony befell him: the one who had unlocked the secrets of immortality was exiled from the very lands he had once elevated. Sworn to wander the vastness beyond the Tomb Kingdoms, he seeks the elusive remedy that would restore his homeland to its prior living magnificence. Until that day, the deserts are forbidden to him.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Yet exile did not diminish him; if anything, it has given him countless opportunities to expand upon his archaic knowledge and power. As eons passed, the Grand Hierophant has amassed an unmatched reservoir of arcane secrets. He wields not only a repertoire of ancient spells but does so with a mastery far beyond any of his tomb priest subordinates. Those who try to combat his magic with their own will quickly be cursed and unable to cast spells as their mouths fill with vile insects. Should the gods choose to favor him, the Grand Hierophant can even surround himself in an obscuring and biting sandstorm, making conventional combat tactics difficult to use against him as well.


The Grand Hierophant is formidable enough on his own, but his true power lies in his command over the legions of the dead. Undead guardians rally to his side, driven by an unwavering loyalty. These minions, guided by his ancient hand, are imbued with enhanced vigor, making them formidable adversaries. While they engage, The Grand Hierophant hurls curses upon his enemies, weakening their resolve and corroding their vitality. 

Many have stood against The Grand Hierophant, and he has outlasted them all. Any who stand in the way of his sacred quest will be cast into the oblivion he has evaded for millennia. And once he has found the secrets he seeks, he will return to his dead, crumbling home and restore it to its former, indomitable heights of power.

While cursed, when a creature casts a spell with a verbal component, it must make a DC 15 ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a success, the curse ends for that creature. On a failed save, it takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage per level of the spell. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 5), the spell has no effect and is wasted as its mouth is filled with sand and dung beetles.
>

The spell does not end if The Grand Hierophant loses concentration as long as the other creature is still concentrating on the spell. The other creature loses concentration if it is 60 or more feet away from The Grand Hierophant, is out of line of sight from The Grand Hierophant, or The Grand Hierophant concentrates on another spell.

### Optional Ability: <br> Wrath of the Desert

The Grand Hierophant is protected by the gods of the desert, who can project their power at his behest. If you give him this ability, increase his CR by 1.     
 
 **Sand Storm (Recharges on a short rest).**
At the start of the round on Initiative count 20, The Grand Hierophant can create a 100-foot tall sandstorm with a 20-foot radius centered at a point within 120 feet of him. This ability can be activated even if The Grand Hierophant is incapacitated or surprised. The storm spreads around corners and lasts for 10 minutes, or until it is dismissed by The Grand Hierophant (no action required) or he dies.

The area within the storm is considered difficult terrain and is heavily obscured for creatures other than The Grand Hierophant. Additionally, ranged weapon attack rolls are made with disadvantage if their path passes through the storm.

On initiative count 20 of subsequent rounds, The Grand Hierophant can move the storm up to 20 feet in any direction. If the storm moves over a creature or if a creature ends its turn within the storm, that creature must make a Strength saving throw (The Grand Hierophant ignores this effect). On a failed save, the creature takes 6d6 slashing damage, is pulled 10 feet toward the storm's center, and if the creature is concentrating on a spell, it makes its concentration saving throw caused by the damage with disadvantage.
 


### Ark of Damnation
  
The Grand Hierophant can be attuned to an Ark of Damnation (the mechanics of which are described earlier in this document.) While attuned, he gains the following special abilities and is considered a CR 20 creature:
  
* He is immune to damage and cannot be moved or teleported against his will while within 5 feet of the ark.
  
* He can unleash the ark's souls (as described in the <Br> ark mechanics below) using a legendary action. <br> The initial target for the souls must be the <br> creature that just took its turn.
  
* He can use a legendary action to teleport <br> the ark and himself to an unoccupied <br> space within 15 feet of the ark.

### The Grand Hierophant Tactics 
The Grand Hierophant represents the pinnacle of tomb priest spellcasters. Always accompanied by a minimum of three elite undead warriors, The Grand Hierophant is a tactician who prioritizes his own safety over dealing direct damage. His potent ability to heal and resurrect his fallen soldiers makes him excel in prolonged engagements, often outlasting his enemies.

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word 
This ability is triggered in reaction to spellcasting threats. If any spellcaster manages to negate the curse, they immediately become the primary target for The Grand Hierophant and his minions.

#### The Grand Hierophant's Staff 
The Grand Hierophant strategically shares his concentration with the healthiest minion, ensuring it is not already paralyzed or vulnerable to incoming attacks. Furthermore, The Grand Hierophant can use the staff to concentrate on a variety of spells, each unlocking unique legendary actions. Below is a prioritized list detailing which spells he should cast first to harness their associated legendary actions.

##### Skull Storm
On its initial turn, The Grand Hierophant casts *skull storm*, targeting two or more enemies. After this, he deploys his Gust of Skulls legendary action whenever he can affect two or more targets again.

##### Black Tentacles
If The Grand Hierophant identifies two or more targets with low Dexterity and *skull storm* is no longer available, he will cast *black tentacles*. Once enemies are restrained, he will use his Drag Down legendary action. However, he avoids using this action on players with a high Strength saving throw, like barbarians.

##### Decrepify
This spell is reserved for scenarios where neither allies nor enemies are closely grouped for The Grand Hierophant's Incantation spells. The ideal targets are martial characters with weak Constitution saving throws. Once cast, he will use his Wither legendary action at the earliest opportunity.

\columnbreak

#### Incantation
The Grand Hierophant should cast spells using his Incantation legendary action when he can affect three or more powerful allies, particularly undead with a CR (Challenge Rating) of 3 or higher. However, these spells are of secondary priority if he can target three or more enemies with *black tentacles* or *skull storm*.

##### Specific Incantations and Their Uses:

**Guiding Wind:** 
* This spell should be deployed to swiftly move a large group of undead into melee combat.

* It is useful for allowing ranged archers to disengage from close combat.

* It acts as a potential escape route for The Grand Hierophant when surrounded. 

* Caution is advised, as adversaries within the spell's radius might also choose to be moved by it.

#####
**Incantation of Zeal vs. Incantation of Protection:**

* *Incantation of zeal* should generally be given priority over *incantation of protection*.

* However, if opponents possess bludgeoning weapons and The Grand Hierophant has skeletons under his command, or if a significant portion of the enemy group consists of martial classes using physical weaponry, then *incantation of protection* should be prioritized.

#### Tomb Strike Legendary Action
This action is used when The Grand Hierophant doesn't have a group of allies to enhance or isn't currently concentrating on a spell.

#### Wrath of the Desert
The Grand Hierophant summons this storm at the start of the fight and positions it to impact the highest number of targets. If players scatter, he directs the storm toward ranged attackers, aiming to disable their attack options.

#### Ark of Damnation
When The Grand Hierophant uses an ark of damnation, his strategy shifts. While he will still cast *skull storm* on his initial turn, all subsequent legendary actions will be devoted to utilizing the power of the ark.

### Grant Hierophant Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Grand Hierophant come in the form of relics and religious icons he carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Tomb Priest Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you're running a battle in which he has a ark of damnation, use the Grand Hierophant's Ark of Damnation Loot Table to determine the additional relics the players are able to uncover.

## Howling <Br> Skull Catapults
In the desolate landscapes of the Tomb Kingdoms there exists a weapon of terrifying power and macabre design - the howling skull catapult. These formidable war machines, as much a symbol of dread as they are of destruction, stand as a testament to the dark ingenuity of their creators.

***Eerie Construct and Crew.*** Crafted from a blend of stone and metal, these catapults are fashioned to resemble bones, with macabre motifs and glyphs adorning their structure. Operated by skeletal crewmen, these catapults loom like grim sentinels on the battlefield, their very presence a chilling sight. The crewmen, bound to their eternal task, work with mechanical precision, unfazed by the chaos of war around them of the screaming of the catapult's ammunition.



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***Cursed Ammunition.*** This horrifying ammunition is crafted from the skulls of slain enemies, each one subjected to dark rituals by the liche-priests. These incantations imbue the skulls with sorcerous curses, causing them to glow with eldritch flames and emit the tormented screams of their previous life's final moments. The sound of these screaming skulls is not merely the byproduct of their curse but serves as a weapon in its own right.

> ___
>
> ***Magical Weapon.*** Any damage dealt by the howling skull catapult counts as magical damage.
>
> ***Screaming Skull.*** Each howling skull catapult has 30 pieces of ammunition built into it that can be removed as needed. This ammunition lets out horrifying screeches that can be heard up to 300 feet away as long as it is within 30 feet of the catapult. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of any screaming ammunition and can hear it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.
>
> On a failure, the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 10), while the creature is frightened, it can't take reactions and must take the Dash action on each of its turns and move away from howling skull catapult by the safest available route.
>
> ### Functions
>
> ***Load.*** The weapon is loaded with a Cursed Skull. It must be prepped two times before it is loaded. It must be loaded before it can fire.
>
> ***Prep (2)*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done two times before it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The howling skull catapult fires a skull that is set ablaze and rains down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet and shatters. Each creature in a 15-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) piercing damage. Each non-undead creature within 30 feet of the point must then make a saving throw against the effects of the Screaming Skull feature.

&emsp;***Terrifying Barrage.*** As the catapults launch their ghastly ammunition, the air fills with the harrowing screams of the damned, creating a symphony of terror. Upon impact, the skulls explode in a burst of spectral fire, causing both physical and psychological devastation, as the screams and the violent eruption sow panic and fear among enemy ranks.

### Howling Skull Catapult Tactics 
The best targets for howling skull catapults are melee fighters, as the fear effects of the screaming skulls can prevent them from closing in. Additionally, the constant screaming of the catapult's ammunition means it can create a protected area for other undead ranged units attempting to avoid melee combat.

### Howling Skull Catapult Loot

Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these screaming scull catapults are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Mason’s Tools) check. Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the crewmen come in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Howling Skull Catapult Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##  Siege Weapon Mechanics
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.



### Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

#### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

#### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

#### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.



\columnbreak



#### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

#### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

##### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

##### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

##### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

#### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

#### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Necroficers

In the crumbling realm of the Tomb Kingdoms, the necroficers stand as the undying masters of artifice and creation. These master artificers, architects, and engineers were the brilliant minds behind the majestic temples, towering monuments, intricate tombs, and the awe-inspiring statues that mark the landscape of the Tomb Kingdoms. They dedicated their lives to crafting these testaments to their civilization’s grandeur, ensuring that their works would endure for millennia.

As their mortal lives drew to a close and they completed their greatest works, these master builders embraced a final act of dedication. Committing ritual suicide, they ensured their remains were meticulously prepared and interred alongside the royalty they served. This act was done with the belief that they would continue to serve and oversee their grand creations in the afterlife. In death, their appearance is both regal and haunting. They don ornate death masks, a symbol of their esteemed status, and are often seen carrying the tools of their trade, the very instruments they were buried with. Notably, they wield wickedly barbed whips, a grim reminder of their once fearsome role as taskmasters, driving laborers to meet their exacting standards.

In life, necroficers were known for their foul tempers and ruthless efficiency. They tolerated no interference and accepted nothing less than perfection. This unyielding obsession has only intensified in death. Many necroficers find themselves in a state of perpetual rage upon witnessing the decay or damage of their once-pristine works. Driven by a relentless desire to restore and preserve these creations, they react with violent fury when any harm befalls their life's work.

Endowed with a rudimentary knowledge of magic by the liche priests, necroficers use this arcane understanding to imbue their creations with runic hieroglyphs, granting them enhancements that defy the limits of mortal craftsmanship. In battle, this mastery becomes evident. Necroficers command and rejuvenate the war constructs of the Tomb Kingdoms, repairing and sustaining these behemoths with a combination of magical incantations and artisanal skill. Woe betide those who dare damage a necroficer’s creation, for they will face the cruel wrath of these undying creators.

> ***Spellcasting.*** The necroficer is a spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It knows the following spells:
> 
> *At will:* *guidance*, *mending*, *thaumaturgy* <br>
> *1/Day:* *alarm*, *fabricate*, *glyph of warding*, *stone shape*
>
> ***Whip Mastery.*** When the necroficer attacks with a whip weapon, it can use its Intelligence modifier, instead of its Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls. Additionally, the weapon deals two extra dice of its damage when the necroficer hits with it (included in the attack).

> 
> ***Check.*** The necroficer makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> ***Frenetic Fervor.*** The necroficer may move up to half its speed without provoking attacks of opportunity. At the end of the movement, it may make a whip attack against a creature within reach of the weapon. If the creature dealt damage to a construct this turn, the attack deals an additional 18 (4d8) damage.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the necroficer is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> ***Soul Jolt (Cost 2 Actions).*** The necroficer chooses one willing Undead Construct or Fiend Construct within 60 feet of it that is Large or larger and has just taken its turn, and the necroficer causes the soul animating the construct to strike out at any number of creatures of the necroficer's choice within 10 feet of the construct. Each chosen creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on success.

### Necroficer Tactics
The necroficers act as frontline support for other undead constructs. They also possess a plethora of out-of-combat spells that can be used to secure places they have built, such as temples or tombs. 

Although necroficers are highly intelligent, they are quick to anger if any of their constructs are destroyed or damaged. This results in them making decisions on which creature to attack based on the amount of damage dealt to its constructs. 

It uses the Wrath of the Creator ability anytime it can reach a target with the ability and hit it. It prioritizes using Restoration on the largest construct present, as this will be the most precious to it. Necroficer Masters save their uses of Fortify for such constructs.

#### Necroficer Visionary Tactics
Necroficer visionaries follow similar tactics to normal necroficers, using Imbue rather than Fortify on the largest construct available. The imbued construct always goes after the target that is the largest threat to itself or positions itself for a Soul Jolt if the enemies are close enough together to be hit by the ability. It has two unique legendary actions it uses under the following circumstances:

**Frenetic Fervor.** This is used similarly to Wrath of the Creator; it will use this ability whenever it doesn't need to use Tenacious Will, or there aren't enough targets for Soul Jolt.

**Soul Jolt.** This is used whenever it can hit three or more targets. Constructs should attempt to position themselves in the largest groups of enemies for this ability.


### Necroficer Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from necroficers come in the form of relics and tools they carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an Intelligence check using proficiency in any type of Artisan's Tools. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Necroficer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Necroscorpions
Deep within the sun-scorched expanses of the ancient Tomb Kingdoms, there lurk the ancient necroscorpions. These formidable constructs, resembling giant scorpions, are a blend of arcane alchemy and masterful craftsmanship, forged to defend the enigmatic realms of the dead.

***Formidable Appearance and Construction.*** Necroscorpions are imposing constructs of stone and enchanted metals; their bodies are the size of a rhino's and adorned with hieroglyphs, sacred sigils, and leering skulls. Their massive claws, capable of cleaving through armor and bone, and long, arched tails armed with deadly stingers, make them a terrifying sight on the battlefield. Inside each construct lies the carefully embalmed body of a fallen tomb priest, whose spirit and residual magical essence give life to these otherwise inert monuments of death.

***Underworld Guardians.*** The peoples of the Tomb Kingdoms believe the underworld to be guarded by monstrous scorpions that serve the gods. The creatures ensure none can prey upon the souls of the dead and that none of those souls escape their realm. Necroscorpions are crafted in the image of these underworld monsters to symbolize their similar purpose in the land of the living. They often include flourishes in their design, such as metallic, skull-like faces and depictions of the underworld etched into their stony carapaces.

***Animating the Ancient Guardians.*** In times of war or when the sanctity of their domain is threatened, the tomb priests of the Tomb Kingdoms call upon these dormant guardians. Invoking ancient rites and channeling their mystical energies, the priests awaken the necroscorpions, whose purpose is to defend the kingdom's borders and sacred sites against all intruders.

***Masters of Ambush.*** Necroscorpions are not just static sentinels; they possess a terrifying ability to burrow and navigate beneath the desert sands. Their approach is heralded by a faint rumbling, moments before they erupt from the ground in a maelstrom of sand and fury, catching their prey off guard. Using their massive claws, they can grasp and rend their chosen target with brutal efficiency.

***Venom of the Damned.*** The venom that drips from their tails is as varied and potent as the magic wielded by the tomb priests whose souls empower these constructs. For instance, a necroscorpion animated by a priest of light magic might unleash venom that burns fiercely, searing flesh and bone with divine radiance. Conversely, a scorpion carrying the essence of a death magic practitioner would have venom capable of sapping the very life force from its victim, leaving behind nothing but a withered husk.

### Additional Types of Venom

The remains of different types of tomb priests encased within necroscorpions can influence these constructs, modifying their venom with the magics known in their unlife. You may choose one of the following abilities to replace the scorpion's standard poison damage and poisoned condition inflicted by its Sting attack.

#### Lore of Light: Radiant Venom
*The scorpion's venom glows white-hot within the victim's veins, causing internal burning and illumination.*

If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it suffers 17 (5d6) radiant damage and begins to glow. On a successful save, it takes half damage and does not glow. While glowing, the creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. Attack rolls against it have advantage if the attacker can see it, and it can't benefit from being invisible. A creature glowing this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) radiant damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success.

#### Lore of Shadow: Mystifying Venom
*The scorpion's sting clouds the victim's mind, causing disorientation and aimless wandering.*

If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) psychic damage and becomes mystified. While mystified, at the start of its turn, it moves in a random direction determined by rolling a d8, continuing until it exhausts its movement, takes damage, or encounters an object or creature. The creature then proceeds with its turn as normal. A creature mystified this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success.

\columnbreak

#### Lore of Death: Leaching Venom
*This venom saps the life force from its target, transferring it back to the scorpion.*

If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) necrotic damage and becomes tainted. On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not tainted. A creature tainted this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and if the scorpion has at least 1 hit point, the scorpion regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. On a success, the effect ends.

#### Lore of Tomb Priests: Necromantic Venom
*The priest within the scorpion was a master of necromancy, and the venom now summons spirits from beyond.*

If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it suffers 17 (5d6) necrotic damage and becomes cursed. On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not cursed. Upon being cursed, a **specter** appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the creature. The specter is obsessed with the cursed creature and acts immediately after the scorpion's turn. A creature cursed this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success. When the curse ends, or the creature dies, the specter is destroyed.

### Necroscorpion Tactics

&emsp;***The Ambush.*** These constructs have the ability to burrow underground and also appear as inanimate statues when not moving. Both tactics allow them to catch their prey off guard. In an environment with deep sand, the necroscorpion will wait 30 feet beneath the surface for intruders to pass by. When it senses a creature with its tremor sense, it will move up towards its target using its Burst Forth feature to knock enemies prone and gain advantage on all its attacks.


***Attack Sequence.*** The necroscorpion is built to focus its attacks on a single target. It will use both of its claw attacks against a target, prioritizing anyone that has been knocked prone by its Burst Forth feature so that it can keep the target from standing back up if any of the attacks hit. It will then attempt to sting the target. 

If it is unable to hit a target with a claw attack, it will retreat back underground and attempt to use its Burst Forth feature again. If it does have the target grappled, it will use its Pull Apart action on that target next turn. 

If the target is grappled, it will sting it unless the target has already been poisoned, in which case it will sting another target.


#### Venom Variants
Necroscorpions have many types of venom, some of which can alter their tactics:

***Radiant Venom:*** This venom works best with other undead minions accompanying the scorpion. If the necroscorpion manages to grapple a prone target with its claws, it will use its sting against a different target, as the advantage granted by the venom would be redundant.

***Mystifying Venom:*** The stinger attack is generally made against another target that the scorpion does not have grappled to try to get that target to wander off.

***Leaching Venom:*** This venom does not majorly change the tactics of the scorpion. The exception is situations where it is near death and has a target under the effects of the venom, in which case it will burrow underground to regain hit points until the target is no longer suffering from the venom.

***Necromantic Venom:*** This variant does not change the tactics of the scorpion.

### Necroscorpions Loot
The valuable items looted from necroscorpions will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (History)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

## Shabtis

The people of the ancient tomb kingdoms <br> worshipped pantheons of gods who were <br> said to blend aspects of animal and <br> human. They possessed the heads of <br> powerful desert beasts, the bodies of <br> humans, and each presided over their <br> respective domains. The people of <br> these kingdoms created many imposing <br> statues of these deities, and when their <br> priests learned how to preserve and bind <br> the spirits of the fallen, they began the <br> practice of enshrining the spirits of their <br> most powerful warriors within these statues. <br> Known as shabti, they stand watch over the <br> most important temples and necropolises <br> of the tomb kingdoms, where they remain <br> motionless but ever vigilant. 

Shabtis awaken only when they detect <br> intruders or hear the summons of a <br> powerful tomb priest. In either case, they <br> stride into battle, wielding giant ornate <br> weapons, from intricately etched blades <br> capable of cutting a horse in half to gilded <br> longbows with blessed arrows the size of <br> spears. Shabtis use their weapons with ease, <br> cutting a swath through would-be intruders and <br> invaders, making them the perfect sentries and <br> monstrous soldiers for their eternal kingdom.

&emsp;***Chosen of the Gods.*** These shabtis are <br> possessed by the spirits of mighty archers who <br> have earned the blessings of their gods. While <br> all shabtis utilize blessed arrows, these <br> warriors are capable of performing miraculous <br> feats with their divine ammunition, such as <br> raining volleys of radiant arrows down upon <br> foes in a deadly barrage. The elevated rank of <br> these archers means they are available only to <br> the most powerful of tomb lords and employed <br> for only the most important of duties, such as <br> providing ranged support in critical battles or <br> protecting the most sacred of temples.

***Soul Wardens.*** These shabtis are built to <br> imprison the souls of those who have earned a <br> special ire from the tomb lords. They are capable <br> of tearing out the souls of their victims and <br> trapping them within their construct bodies. <br> Some transport the souls of the victims to their <br> masters for further punishment, but many serve <br> as a prison for the soul of an especially powerful transgressor, such as a traitorous priest, <br> renegade necromancer, or even a powerful <br> demon. The presence of a tomb warden serves <br> as a grim reminder to would-be tomb robbers <br> that a fate worse than death awaits them should <br> they fall into the clutches of these dreaded <br> guardians.

### Shabti Adventures
Below are some ways to introduce shabtis into your games:

##### Shabti Adventure Hooks

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | A town the players are visiting has been established among ancient ruins. While the players are exploring one of the underground ruins, they awaken a regiment of shabti set on clearing the settlement of "intruders." |
|  2  |The players are raiding a tomb for rare magical items. However, they soon discover that any who possess the artifacts are relentlessly hunted by vengeful shabti. |
|  3  | While traveling through an unforgiving desert, the players find an oasis blessed by the gods but guarded by their chosen shabti. |
|  4  | The players discover an ancient vault protected by shabti soul wardens who themselves contain the spirits of powerful demons who will be free to roam the world once more should the shabti be destroyed.|

### Shabti Tactics

Though these creatures are unwaveringly loyal constructs, they are not mindless. They possess the souls of mighty champions, complete with all their tactical skills. Though they are single-minded in pursuing a given task, they can adapt their strategies and tactics as needed. They generally don’t rush into combat but slowly stride toward foes while taking shots from their great bows. If it’s clear they have ranged superiority, they may keep their distance. Otherwise, they will close in and engage in melee combat. 

If shabtis are charged with guarding a specific character or location, they will never leave their post unless commanded otherwise. They will also prioritize attacking whichever character is the biggest threat to whatever they’re protecting.

If shabtis are serving as sentries, they will usually stand motionless and attempt to catch intruders off guard with surprise attacks when they are most vulnerable.

***Chosen of the Gods.*** These shabtis make an extra effort to stay at a range, even if it means taking opportunity attacks, and their Blessed Arrows ability allows them to be more flexible in where they can fire from. Their Divine Barrage attack is best used when it can hit at least 3 enemies at once.

***Soul Wardens.***  When a soul warden acts as part of a general attack force, it will rush in and use its Capture Soul on whichever player is easiest to reach or looks most likely to fail the saving throw. Once it has a player incapacitated, it will start using its multiattacks to dispatch everyone else. 

If the soul warden has been tasked with capturing a specific soul, or one of the players is guilty of some particularly egregious offense, it will focus on that target, striking it repeatedly with its Capture Soul ability. Once it captures the desired soul, the soul warden will often flee the battle, taking its prize with it.


### Shabti Loot
The valuable items looted from shabti will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Shabti Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Titan of the Gods

These massive ornate constructs were built to serve as conduits to the netherworld. They preside over the tombs of ancient kings, ensuring they are guided to the afterlife. In one hand, they wield a massive sun staff that lights the way through the netherworld and allows them to unleash solar rays through their burning eyes. In the other hand, they carry a set of scales used to judge the worthiness of souls and rip apart the life force of those still living. 

When stirred to battle, the titan of the gods serves as an avatar of the divine that walks the mortal realm. Its connection to the realm of the gods allows divine beings to hear the prayers and rituals beseeching them for power more clearly. Those who draw on the gods for power find they can more freely call upon that power in the presence of this titan, and the titan serves as a messenger to communicate the gods' will to their supplicants.

#### Titan of the Gods Tactics

These constructs possess the divine insight of the gods, which makes them quite good at accessing which players are least likely to be able to resist their spells. As such, they will usually avoid targeting dexterous players with their *burning gaze* or charismatic players with their *spirit leech*. 

The titan will use its Frightful Presence ability to control the positioning of players while closing in to smash softer targets with its sun staff while targeting players with weak saving throws with its spells. 
Below are tips on how to use its spells:

***Burning gaze.*** The titan will use this whenever it can hit at least three players who don’t have the Evasion ability with it.

***Dispel evil and good.*** The titan will only have use for this spell if the players have an allied creature with them who can be affected by it.

***Forbiddance.*** The titan casts this on any area it has been charged with protecting. It will try to engage players in the area affected by this spell whenever possible.

***Spirit leech.*** The titan will use this if there are no grouped-up players, and it could use some healing.

### Titan of the Gods Loot
The valuable items looted from bone colossi will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)**, **Intelligence (Nature)**, or **Intelligence (Religion)** or check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Titan of the Gods Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Tomb Chariots & Cavalry
The ancient tomb kingdoms were masters of using warhorses to gain the edge over their more primitive opponents. These steeds were so prized they were entombed with their riders when they died. When the legions of the tomb kingdoms rise to make war once more, their loyal steeds rise with them and ride out to meet any enemy foolish enough to stand against the deathless legions.

You can use the stats for the **warhorse skeleton** from the Monster Manual to represent most of these steeds and have them serve as mounts for any of the tomb kingdom infantry.

### Chariots of The Dead

Not only were the tomb kingdoms masters of mounted combat, but they were also among the first civilizations to use chariots in warfare. Because the tomb kings were seen as divine beings, it was forbidden for them to sully themselves by riding on the back of an animal. As such, war chariots were created to carry them into battle, where they could move between important locations to deliver instructions and charge vulnerable foes. War chariots soon came to be seen as a symbol of status among the royalty, with the most powerful tomb kings able to field legions of thundering chariots to crush their foes. 

Great care was taken to preserve these chariots for use in the afterlife, and when the undying tomb legions march to battle, these chariots thunder alongside them. The chariots almost serve as an extension of their undead charioteer’s will, and they are utilized by tomb soldiers and royalty alike with terrifying results.

> ***Dead Man's Crew.*** If one or more undead creatures riding the chariot or pulling it as steeds would make a saving throw against an effect that turns undead, an undead creature acting as the charioteer may instead make the save on their behalf. If the charioteer succeeds on the save, they all automatically pass the save, and if the charioteer fails, they all automatically fail the save.
>
> ### Steed Actions
> ***Frightful Charge.*** Each undead steed may make a melee weapon attack against each creature it is facing within 5 feet of it. If the chariot moves at least 20 feet in a straight line before the attacks are made, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) damage and each creature hit must then succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the chariot.<br> If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 7), it becomes terrified of the chariot and must use the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the chariot by the safest available route while it is frightened this way, unless there is nowhere to move. <br> A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Royal Warhorse Mummy
Most steeds were preserved using the same rituals as common soldiers. However, like their human counterparts, greater rites of preservation were used for those of greater status. The most prized steeds kept by the ancient royalty were given proper rituals of mummification when they died. When these steeds return to the land of the living, they do so with the unnatural vitality and terrifying powers of their royal masters. 

In war, mummified warhorses serve as steeds for the most elite tomb soldiers and pull the chariots of the tomb royalty. Their cursed hooves doom any they strike, and their terrifying equine glare breaks the will of all but the most resolute soldiers. Never tiring of their duty, these elite steeds work in tangent with their undying riders to destroy any that stand against their terrifying charge.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
>
> ***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 9), it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.

### Desert Storm Riders
The skeletal cavalry of the tomb legions are often used as outriders to harass and harry foes using their speed in conjunction with guerilla warfare. The most feared of these outriders are the legendary Desert Storm riders. This legion of horsemen were notorious for their ability to sweep up great clouds of sand as they rode, which they would use as cover to enable disorienting hit-and-run attacks.

These riders' regiments included melee warriors for running down vulnerable foes and skilled archers for picking apart enemies from a distance. Together, they would often act as a vanguard force that would throw enemy forces into disarray while kicking up great clouds of dust that would make it hard to target or identify the rest of the approaching tomb kingdom army. After the enemy army was broken and routed, the Storm Riders would run down fleeing soldiers, brutely slaying them during their panicked retreat. 

In their new unlife, these riders continue to serve their kingdom, patrolling the desert and running down any would-be intruders. Many adventuring expeditions into the realm of the tomb kingdoms have been cut short by these merciless cavalrymen.

### Tomb Cavalry Tactics
#### Chariot of the Dead
These chariots are designed for effective hit-and-run tactics. Their primary strategy should involve moving swiftly between multiple targets 
with the intention of instilling fear in as many enemies as possible.

#### Royal Warhorse Mummy
These mummified steeds may be slower than standard riding horses, but they compensate with their menacing presence and substantial hit points. When acting independently, the mummy will opt to dash towards an opponent to initiate a Trampling Charge if the target is within range. If the target is not within charging distance, the mummy employs its Dreadful Glare instead.

If the royal warhorse mummy is being ridden as a controlled mount, the rider can direct it to use its Dreadful Glare against an adversary, even when a Trampling Charge attack is possible. This tactic might be preferred if the target appears hardy enough to withstand the charge.

#### Warhorse Skeleton of the Desert Winds
These skeletal horses are not designed for sustained melee combat. Instead, they excel as mounts for skirmishers or ranged attackers, leveraging their exceptional speed. Their unique ability, Kick Up Dust, can be tactically combined with other creatures possessing the Desert Ambush Cavalry trait.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

#### Skeletal Horseman of the Desert Storm
These skeletal horsemen serve as agile ambush cavalry, specializing in disrupting enemy lines by targeting spellcasters and ranged combatants. They aim to dislodge weapons and magical focuses from their adversaries' grips and then use their agility to retreat swiftly. Should they be pursued by equally fast foes, they will attempt to utilize the desert terrain for concealment. When mounted on desert wind warhorses, the dust clouds created by the horses' dashing actions provide handy cover for their hit-and-run attacks.

#### Skeletal Archer of the Desert Storm
These soldiers use similar ambush tactics to their horsemen counterparts. However, they focus on inflicting damage rather than causing disruptions. They excel at targeting enemies seeking cover and can leverage their ranged sneak attack bonus against foes already engaged with the archers' allies. If operating solo or in groups without melee support, these archers will prioritize using their turn to hide after an ambush, setting themselves up to make another sneak attack on a subsequent turn.

### Tomb Cavalry Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the soldiers and steeds of the Tomb Kingdoms come in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check. In the case of the steeds, this could be done using an **Intelligence (Nature)** check.

In the case of the chariots, the valuables will come from whatever can be salvaged from their remains. This salvaging could be done using the same checks or using tools related to the materials being salvaged, such as using an Intelligence (Woodcarver's Tools) check to harvest wood from the chariot's frame.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Cavalry Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Chariot Mechanics
The following rules can help you codify ways to use chariots in your games. They can be applied to chariots of different shapes and sizes. The rules here can be applied to most vehicles pulled by other creatures, such as wagons and carriages.

### Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

#### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.



#### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

##### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

##### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.

\columnbreak

##### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, chariots are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The chariot may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by steeds.



### Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

#### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

#### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

#### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

#### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

#### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

#### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

#### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.


> ##### Determining Chariot CR
>When building your own chariot, you can determine its CR using most of the creature creation guidelines described in the DMG with the following modifications:
> * Determine its Offensive CR using additional damage per round it grants to its riders and steeds.
> * Determine its Defensive CR using half its HP.
> * Consider other traits it has the same way you would consider creature attributes.

## Tomb Kingdoms Infantry

Deep within ancient tombs and buried under sandy dunes lie forgotten legions whose loyalty to their bygone kingdoms and undying lords transcends death. These soldiers swore to continue their service into the afterlife and died with their weapons and armor in hand to ensure they would always be ready to answer the call of their eternal lords.

When the undying priests and monarchs of antiquity make war, they summon these regiments of unbreakable undead warriors who tirelessly carry out the orders of their superiors. These skeletal soldiers have forgotten most of their former identities, retaining only their training and their sense of unwavering duty. In battle, they execute the commands of their superiors with flawless devotion, never flinching in the face of danger as they carry out their eternal service.

### Skeletal Infantry
These undead represent the most numerous and lowest-ranking soldiers of the tomb pharaoh armies. They were given only the most rudimentary of burial rites, resulting in almost none of their former personality surviving. They possess only the knowledge and skills needed to serve as efficient and loyal soldiers. Though they cannot speak, they can understand and carry out orders with flawless efficiency. Each skeletal regiment retains the years of training and experience with its weapons and combat role that it had in life, and the long years have not dulled their skills.

#### Skeletal Spearmen
These soldiers make up the backbone of most tomb pharaoh armies. They march in seemingly endless ranks of bone and bronze, wielding ancient spears and impaling every foe before them. Though they are not the most powerful soldiers, they make up for this with numbers and unshakable resolve. Skeletal spearmen will fight against even the most overwhelming odds, never fleeing and fighting to the last soldier. 

##### The Scorpion Legion
The spearmen of this notorious legion are known for crafting their spears from the tails of deadly desert scorpions. These skeletal soldiers wield their venomous weapons with brutal skill, and foes that survive the initial stab will often succumb to the poisonous aftereffects. 

#### Skeletal Archers
These warriors served as the ranged support to their ancient armies. Armed with bows and an ever-ready supply of bronze-tipped arrows, these archers rained death on their foes to wound and demoralize armies before they could even engage in melee combat. In death, these archers continue to fulfill their ancient role, unleashing streams of arrows with no thought other than to carry out the orders of their eternal masters.

##### The Hawk Legion
These renowned archers were not only expertly trained soldiers but devoted disciples of the hawk god, whose domains were discernment and the hunt. In exchange for their devotion, the hawk god granted them his heightened senses and blessed their arrows such that they would unerringly find their quarry, regardless of any obstacle.

### Tomb Warriors
In life, these soldiers were among the most fanatically loyal to their monarch. These warriors eschewed the protection of a shield and spear, instead duel-wielding curved blades known as khopeshes to maximize their killing potential. Their khopesh blades allow them to knock weapons out of their foes’ grips, potentially sending them flying out of reach. These warriors then ruthlessly cut down their defenseless victims before continuing their bloody rampage. Tomb warriors have lost none of their fervor in death and continue to charge headlong into battle, headless of any danger.

#### Netherworld Legion
When mortals died and passed into the afterlife, it was said their souls would be judged by the discerning gaze of the god of the underworld. Those who displeased this god or were found unworthy would be cast down to the netherworld to suffer for eternity. However, some warriors could bargain for a better fate by offering their service as enforcers of their god’s will in the mortal realm. 

This netherworld legion of warriors can be summoned by those who curry favor with the god of the underworld. Even in the land of the living, they are spectral warriors who flicker in and out of the Material Plane. Their otherworldly nature can even transfer into objects they disarm from foes, preventing their retrieval. And when these warriors are defeated and banished back to the netherworld, they can leave a lingering curse that partially unmoors mortals from the Material Plane.

A creature cursed this way has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws, has the skeleton's Etherealness bonus action, has the skeleton's Ethereal Sight trait, and gains a fly speed of 15 ft. with the ability to hover.
>
>  As an action, a cursed creature can repeat the saving throw to attempt to end the curse. If a creature would return to Material Plane in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, it is immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it is moved.

If both attacks hit the same creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop an object of the skeleton's choice. The object lands at the creature's feet, and if the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 8), the skeleton can have the object flung up to 10 feet away from the creature in the direction of the skeleton's choice. The skeleton can choose for the flung item to enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. The item returns to the plane it was shunted from after 1 minute.

>




> ##### Option Rules: Binding Curses or Longer lasting Curses
>If you're running an adventure where your players turning ethereal and being able to move through objects would be problematic, you can modify the curse so that creatures under its effects can't move, be moved, or be teleported more than 30 feet away from where the skeleton that cursed them died. On the flip side, if you want to make the curse a key part of how players explore an adventure location, you can extend its duration.

### Sepulchral Guard
These soldiers served as elite infantry and personal guards to their kings. As a reward for their service, they were granted more elaborate burial rites upon their death. Though these rites were nowhere near the complexity of those reserved for royalty, they allowed the sepulchral guard to retain some semblance of their personality into undeath. In addition to being excellent soldiers and bodyguards, these soldiers are capable of verbal communication, abstract reasoning, and carrying out higher-level strategic plans. They answer directly to their kingdom’s rulers and ensure their will is carried out in the field of battle. 

#### Eternal Guard
Though all sepulchral guard legions consider themselves to be “eternal,” this legion takes the expression to the extreme by courting the favor of their death god in exchange for regenerative abilities. This blessed regeneration allows the enteral guard to suffer devastating assaults and rise again to ruthlessly cut down those who thought they could best the elite soldiers of the death god. Such is their tenacity that they don’t bother with using shields for protection and instead duel-wield khopeshes so they may better cut down their comparatively fragile foes.

##### Tomb Kingdom Infantry Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The players find an artifact deep in a crypt protected by necromantic wards. As they attempt to bypass its defenses, the artifact awakens waves of skeletal soldiers who threaten to overwhelm them.|
|  2  |The players search a coastal desert for buried treasures lost to shipwrecks over the years. However, the sands also hide skeletal soldiers ready to awaken the moment they’re disturbed.  |
|  3  | The players explore an impossible underground labyrinth patrolled by netherworld warriors. By purposely exposing themselves to the nether-curse of these warriors, the players can ethereally explore the otherwise untraversable dungeon.   |
|  4  | The players come across a battlefield where legions of skeletal soldiers clash against one another, continually reassembling and marching back into the fray as they are destroyed.|

> Mummy Soldiers
The skeletal soldiers and tomb warriors presented here are assumed to be more skeletal than mummy-like and, as such, have a weakness to bludgeoning damage rather than fire damage. If you wish to flavor these minions as being lesser mummies, you can change their bludgeoning weakness to fire weakness.

#### Tomb Kingdom Infantry Tactics

These soldiers are the least sentient and most expendable tomb kingdom creatures. Isolated groups of them can serve as low-level threats to players, and at higher levels, they can be used to overwhelm the players with numbers or to bog them down and set up attacks from more powerful creatures. In the event of a retreat, skeletons can also slow down the players and allow more important creatures to escape. 

Skeletal soldiers still retain their intuition for battle tactics and know how to position themselves for the optimal use of their weapons. They can also recognize high-threat targets, such as players dealing bludgeoning damage, and they will focus on eliminating such threats. However, they are usually not intelligent enough to recognize a threat before it becomes obvious. For example, they won’t understand a mace will deal extra damage, only that the player with the mace appears to be doing more damage and is, therefore, a more significant threat. They can also recognize when players are resistant to their damage or have such high defense that attacking them would be inefficient.

***Skeleton Spearmen.*** These skeletons have retained enough of their training to know how to maneuver and optimally use the reach of their spears while making counterattacks against them difficult. Each spearman has two extra spears on hand. 

***The Scorpion Legion.*** These skeletons are excellent at ganging up on a single player and debuffing them with the poisoned condition while racking up large amounts of poison damage.

***Skeleton Archers.*** These skeletons will stay out of melee range, using the Disengage action when needed to keep players at a distance. They will keep other melee skeletons between themselves and the players when possible.

***The Hawk Legion.*** While most archers should stay out of melee combat, this legion's Sacred Arrows ability allows them to snipe players from more flexible locations, making it even easier to keep them out of reach of the players.




##### Tomb Warriors
These soldiers combine the skeleton’s lack of self-preservation with zealous bloodlust. They should be played very aggressively and will usually charge after the highest threat target they can reach. Most of the time, this will be any player wielding a bludgeoning weapon. They are intelligent enough to assess how difficult it will be to knock a given weapon out of someone’s hands and will usually start with easier targets. 

If they are being directed by a more intelligent commander, it can also often be advantageous to command them to knock a spell focus from a caster’s hands. Once the caster can no longer cast defensive spells, a squad of tomb warriors can quickly cut them down to size.

***Legion of the Netherworld.***  These warriors fight similarly to normal tomb warriors, but their ethereal abilities add an extra layer of complexity. Use their Incorporeal Movement to sneak up on high-priority targets more easily while evading counterattacks. Players with magical bludgeoning weapons are the highest priority, and netherworld warriors will focus on disarming them and knocking their weapons into the Ethereal Plane if possible.

##### Sepulchral Guard
These elite soldiers and bodyguards retain more of their sentience than other skeletons. They can execute more complex strategies and have enough awareness to change their tactics when needed. However, they still lack a true sense of self-preservation and will throw their unlives away at the command of their masters. If they are left masterless, they will continue to guard anything belonging to the master and will seek vengeance on any who slay their master. 

The combination of their Halting Strikes and Reactive Strike abilities allows sepulchral guards to prevent players from reaching those they are charged with protecting. If their master is present, they will stay within 10 feet of it to ensure no one gets by. This then gives the master the opportunity to move further out of reach while the sepulchral guards harry the players. If sepulchral guards are working alongside other ranged units, they can protect them in a similar way.

While sepulchral guards are aware of their weakness to bludgeoning damage, their highest priority will be whoever is the greatest threat to their master.

***Eternal Guard.*** These skeletons operate similarly to normal sepulchral guards.

## Tomb Knights <br> & Tomb Serpents
In the sunbaked deserts and ancient necropolises of the Tomb Kingdoms, the tomb knights stand as a symbol of undying strength and loyalty. These elite warriors, once the most formidable in life, continue to serve in death, mounted upon their fearsome steeds - the tomb serpents.

**Formidable Steeds.** The tomb serpents are a sight to behold, colossal serpentine statues crafted from stone and metal, their forms echoing the deadly desert cobras of the dunes. Towering over the sands, these constructs possess an otherworldly grace in their movement, their bodies adorned with intricate hieroglyphs and sacred symbols. Their fangs, as long as scimitars, are not just for show – they drip with potent venom, a mimicry of the lethal toxins found in the desert serpents they resemble.

**Masters of Ambush.** The tomb serpents are not merely fearsome in appearance but are also formidable in battle strategy. Their design allows them to burrow through the desert sands, moving unseen before bursting forth in a terrifying ambush. This ability makes them unpredictable and deadly, capable of turning the tide of battle by striking unexpectedly from below.

**Bonded in Death.** Each tomb knight was once a veteran soldier who, after years of brutal combat, began to show signs of uncontrolled bloodlust of other forms of mental instability. Rather than face the shame of dismissal, they voluntarily committed ritual suicide using the excruciating venom of a tomb serpent so that they could serve in the eternal afterlife as tomb knights. These warriors were each buried alongside a tomb serpent statue. 

Upon awakening from their deathly slumber, the spirit of the tomb knight infuses the statue, bringing the tomb serpent to life. This mystical bond allows them to fight as one, with the tomb knight riding atop his serpentine steed, wielding ancient weapons and tactics long forgotten by modern civilizations.

**Unified Existence.** The tomb knight and his tomb serpent are bound by more than just loyalty; they share a single spirit. This unique connection means that to vanquish them, one must destroy both knight and steed. As long as one remains, the other can continue to fight, driven by the undying will that animates them.

#### Venom Knights
In the realm of the tomb kingdoms, the greatest power belongs to those who carry the greatest blessings of their gods, allowing warriors to intertwine their martial powers with ancient and divine magic. The venom knights stand as a testament to this combination of divine favor and lethal skill. These elite tomb knights, once formidable in their own right, received a dark blessing from the serpent goddess of their pantheon. Her gift transformed them into harbingers of venomous destruction. Clad in armor adorned with serpentine designs and wielding enchanted lances dripping with deadly toxins, they strike fear into the hearts of their foes. The venom that coats their weapons is a manifestation of their goddess’s power, crippling and weakening even the strongest adversaries with terrifying efficiency.

What sets the venom knights apart is their uncanny ability to exploit the vulnerabilities of those afflicted by poison. With each precise strike, they demonstrate an almost supernatural understanding of how to maximize the agony and effectiveness of their venomous assault. In battle, they are silent and deadly hunters, their presence often unnoticed until it's too late, and their enemies lay incapacitated by their toxic blades. The existence of the venom knights serves as a chilling reminder of the Tomb Kingdoms' mastery over death and poison, making them a feared force across the desolate landscapes they haunt.

### Tomb Knight & <br> Tomb Serpent Tactics
#### Tomb Serpents

Tomb serpents are ambush creatures that either pretend to be inanimate statues or hide beneath the sand, waiting for prey to pass by. In sandy environments, they will wait 25 feet beneath the sand and emerge 10 feet away from their intended victim. They attack with a bite and tail attack, then dive 25 feet below the surface again before repeating the process on their next turn.

Tomb serpents act as skirmishers, attempting to poison as many targets as possible. They always leverage their reach and burrow speed to stay out of melee reach from their targets. They will also use their tails to push back any creature that could potentially make an attack of opportunity against them as they retreat underground.

#### Tomb Knights
These warriors serve as elite cavalry for the Tomb Kingdoms and focus on charging into the vulnerable flanks of foes. Their Mount Bound ability and Redirect reaction work well together as the knight can redirect attacks to itself if it is at 0 hit points. However, if the mount has been reduced to zero hit points and the knight still has the majority of its hit points, it will not use this reaction.

When they're riding tomb serpents, you can utilize their steed's pushing tail attacks to set up effective lance attacks from the knight.

##### Venom Knights
Using the same tactics as Tomb Knights, a Venom Knight should always have a mount capable of poisoning targets. Tomb serpents are ideal, as, along with their poison, their tail attack can push targets away, ensuring the knight's lance does not gain disadvantage.

### Tomb Knight Loot
The valuable items looted from tomb serpents will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the tomb knights comes in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check.

## Tomb Lords
These monarchs ruled vast <br> kingdoms when civilization was <br> still young. Their ruthless ambition <br> saw them conquer huge territories <br> and amass untold troves of wealth. <br> Their egos were such that they saw <br> themselves as above death. So, they <br> had themselves mummified so they <br> could rule their kingdoms for eternity. <br> However, they’ve awoken to find their <br> bodies as shriveled husks and their kingdoms <br> crumbling and pillaged of treasures. Though <br> they still possess immense physical might, they <br> can no longer enjoy the sensations of life. Though they <br> still have many riches, much of it was stolen. Though they still have loyal subjects, they are undead minions only possessing a shadow of their former selves.

The rage at what they’ve lost and their desire to retake <br> what they feel the afterlife owes them drives the tomb <br> lords ruthlessly reclaim their territory and punish any trespassers in their domain. This indomitable will <br> manifests itself in their undead subjects, who become <br> much more formidable in the presence of their lord.

***Chosen of the Gods.*** The monarchy of these <br> long-lost kingdoms claimed to be divinely blessed, if <br> not the direct descendants of gods themselves. Those <br> struck by tomb lords experience direct evidence to <br> back this claim, for these undying monarchs strike <br> with the divine fury of their patron gods. This blessing <br> may come in the form of poisonous strikes, attacks <br> enhanced with solar radiance, or an onslaught so <br> vicious it mentally scars victims and forces them to <br> drop to their knees in prostration. 

The most sinister of these divine manifestations is <br> not a blessing on the tomb lord but a curse on anyone <br> who strikes it down. These curses reflect the gods <br> who favored the tomb lord and may leave victims <br> racked with poison, unable to recall learned <br> knowledge, or feeling the inevitable pull of death <br> tugging at their souls.

***Tomb Nobles.*** Most members of ancient royalty <br> were not destined for the throne. The sons of mighty monarchs who were not heirs to the throne served as commanders and enforcers for their father’s will. <br> Many strive to earn favor with their king, performing <br> deeds in his name as they jockey for positions in the <br> royal hierarchy. Others seek to gather enough power <br> to dethrone their father and take his place at the <br> head of an undying kingdom of their own.

### Additional Curses of the Gods

Many tomb lords have a specific god they regard as their patron. These gods enact divine punishments on those who strike the tomb lord down in a unique way that makes it clear which deity has been angered. You may replace the effects of the tomb noble’s or tomb king’s Vengeful Curse with one of the following curses.

#### Curse of Death's Grip
This is the most common curse tomb lords inflict and is the default curse listed in their stat blocks. The curse is inflicted by gods associated with death and funerary rites. Those under its effect feel the inevitable pull of the grave tugging at their soul.

While cursed this way, the target automatically fails any death saving throws it makes and treats the roll as if it rolled a 1.

#### Curse of the Glaring Sun
Many of the greatest kings of old claimed to be blessed by, or even descendent from, the god of the sun. Those who cut down these monarchs are cursed by the sun’s perpetual glare. 

Whenever a creature cursed this way is in direct sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

#### Curse of the Lost Lessons
Some monarchs made gods of knowledge their patron deities in hopes of receiving their wisdom. Those who earn the ire of these gods soon find themselves stripped of such wisdom.

The cursed creature can't add its proficiency bonus to skill checks, tool checks, or saving throws.

#### Curse of the Marked Prey
Monarchs who were fierce warriors and hunters earned the favor of gods of the wild. Those cursed by such gods become easy prey to their enemies. 

Weapon attacks against the cursed creature can't suffer from disadvantage.


#### Curse of the Serpent's Kiss
The cursed creature loses any immunity or resistance it has to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Additionally, if this curse originated from a tomb noble, and the creature takes any piercing, slashing, or poison damage, the creature takes an additional 2(1d4) poison damage. If the curse originated from a tomb king, it instead takes an additional 4 (1d8) poison damage.

### Additional Magic Strikes

If you wish to replace the effects of the Tyrannical <br> Strike ability for a tomb noble or tomb king, you <br> can use one of the following effects instead. The <br> save DC for a tomb noble is 15, and for a tomb <br> king, it’s 17. The tomb monarch in the descriptions <br> refers to the tomb noble or tomb pharaoh with this <br> ability.

#### Nullifying Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an <br> additional 10 (3d6) force damage. Once per turn, when <br> the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a <br> Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops <br> an object of the tomb monarch’s choice, and the tomb monarch can have the object flung up to 10 feet away in <br> the direction of its choice. If the object is magical, its <br> magical properties are suppressed for the next minute. 
 
#### Siphoning Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains a level of exhaustion, and the tomb monarch gains advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. These effects last until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. 
 
#### Sun Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) radiant damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. 

#### Tyrannical Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) psychic damage.

While frightened this way, the target can't stand up.

#### Venom Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. While it is poisoned this way, if it fails another saving throw against a poison effect, it becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.

### Tomb Lords Tactics

Tomb lords are generals who lead their undead forces from the front. They always have an entourage of undead minions at their side, and in battle, a tomb lord will attempt to stay in the middle of these minions so they can all benefit from its abilities. Ensuring their minions are empowered this way is usually a higher priority than moving to strike higher-priority targets. That’s dirty work better left to minions. 

Tomb lords are fearless in battle but have enough foresight to withdraw from a losing fight. If the tomb lord has lost most of its minions or is low on health, it will usually retreat to a secure location where it can regroup and plot its revenge. If the tomb lord is fighting in its home or a site sacred to it, it will stubbornly fight to the end rather than risk disgrace.

### Tomb Lords Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the lordsof the Tomb Kingdoms come in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Lords Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Tomb Noble Loot Table

|  18-24 | 2d4(2) 100gp Items |

## Tomb Priests

In the heart of the vast desert, where timeless pyramids touch the sky and ancient secrets lay buried beneath golden sands, the tomb priests stand as the eternal custodians of the Tomb Kingdoms. Theirs is the lore of life, death, and the shadowy realm that lies between.

***Spiritual Stewards.*** Tomb priests were not merely mages or scholars; they were the religious leaders of the Tomb Kingdoms. Entrusted with the divine responsibility of ensuring their pharaohs and royalty achieved immortality, these priests were the masterminds behind the intricate preservation of both the rulers and their vast armies. They mummified bodies, sealed tombs with arcane runes, and ensured that even in death, the grandeur of their kingdom persisted.

***Eternal Vigil.*** The tomb priests were tasked with discovering the ultimate mystery: transcending death itself. Through their relentless search for arcane knowledge, they found a way to trap their souls within their withering bodies, thus escaping death's final embrace. This, however, became both their greatest achievement and curse. Over the ages, their once-robust forms have withered into skeletal husks. Their skin is stretched tight over bone, and their eyes, once full of vigor, now glow with an eerie, unending light.

***Awakeners of the Dead.*** The vast silent legions of the Tomb Kingdoms can be roused to life via the incantations of the tomb priests. Using ancient rituals, they learned to call back the spirits of their royalty, imbuing mummified corpses with new unlife. Likewise, they can awaken entire preserved armies, ready to march and fight once again under the banners of their eternal kingdom.

***Divine Arcanists.*** Every spell, every invocation, and every ritual the tomb priests perform is a homage to their deities. They believe their power flows directly from the gods they worship. Their magic, diverse and potent, is recorded meticulously in ancient tomes, books, and scrolls of papyrus. These texts are treasures in their own right, containing secrets that have shaped the destiny of the Tomb Kingdoms.

***Hierarchy of Eternity.*** Among the tomb priests, rank and structure are paramount. From the lowliest acolyte studying the first mysteries of death to the high priests who hold secrets as old as the sands themselves, there is a clear hierarchy. When these eternal priests congregate, their combined power, channeled through sacred rituals, can alter the very fabric of reality, making them a formidable force in both the realms of magic and governance.

### Optional Rule: Hieratic Hierarchy

When several tomb priests collaborate in their usage of magic, they can combine their powers to form an arcane hierarchy that allows them to support each others' abilities.

A hierarchy consists of at least two spell casters in service to the Tomb Kingdoms. Any of the creatures in this document can be members of a hierarchy. The Challenge Rating (CR) of members of a hierarchy should be increased by 1.

Members of a hierarchy gain the following benefits:

* Upon rolling initiative, members of a hierarchy can swap their initiative orders with each other in any order they agree upon.

* When a member of the hierarchy casts a spell requiring concentration, it can choose another willing member who isn't already concentrating on a spell to maintain concentration on the spell in its place. Moreover, if a member dies while concentrating on a spell, another member can choose to maintain concentration of the spell for its remaining duration.

* All members gain a +1 bonus to saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells for each hierarchy member within 60 feet.

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The God-Pharaoh's Return:** The tomb priests are working on a ritual to reincarnate a long-dead God-Pharaoh, a ruler so powerful that his reign would spell doom for the living world. The adventurers must find and destroy the artifacts that power this ritual.|
|  2  | **The Last Acolyte:** Rumors speak of a last living acolyte of a tomb priest, carrying secrets that could either bolster the Tomb Kingdoms or bring about their final demise. Both protectors and hunters of this acolyte seek the party's assistance.|
|  3  |**Deserted Village:** A village near the Tomb Kingdoms has been mysteriously abandoned overnight. Tracks lead to an underground crypt where a tomb priest is rumored to have been experimenting with new forms of magic. |
|  4  | **The Soul Harvest:** A tomb priest has devised a dark ritual that drains the souls of the living to rejuvenate his desiccated form. Villages nearby are reporting their people falling into soulless comas. The adventurers must stop the ritual and confront the priest before an entire city becomes his next target. |
|  5  | **Keepers of the Forbidden Library**: An ancient library containing forbidden knowledge is protected by the tomb priests. When an explorer manages to steal a tome and is subsequently cursed, the adventurers are hired to infiltrate the library, return the book, and break the curse.  |

### Tomb Priest Tactics
These powerful spellcasters specialize in enhancing their undead minions. They possess a range of spells, and different rankings of priests have different power levels.

Instead of detailing every rank of tomb priest, these tactics focus on the spells they can access and how to use them most effectively. The more spells the tomb priest has access to, the more urgently they should be cast, typically starting with the most potent. Tomb priests can wisely identify party members with weak proficiencies and saving throws and use that to determine who to target with what spells.

#### Lore of Death 
Death tomb priests prioritize dealing damage and will sacrifice minions to empower themselves. They reserve their stronger spells for later stages of combat when enemies are more likely to fail their saves, thanks to their Life Leech trait.

**Crippling Pain:** Target skirmishers like rogues or monks to hinder their combat effectiveness.

**Spirit Leech:** Use when a target with low Charisma is within range or when the priest's health drops below half.

**Impending Doom:** Target martial characters with multiple attacks and low Charisma.

**Horrifying Laughter or Wind of Death:**  Use *horrifying laughter* to target martial characters with low Wisdom scores. Switch to *wind of death* when its saving throw has been boosted by at least +1 or if it can affect four or more targets, as it synergizes well with the Life Leech trait.

**Aspect of Dread:** This is a strong opening spell, forcing multiple targets to make saving throws and fueling the tomb priest's Life Leech trait. It can also be cast on an enemy to frighten its allies or serve as an escape tool when the tomb priest is surrounded.

\columnbreak

#### Lore of Tomb Priests

Tomb priests with this lore rely heavily on their minions for maximum potential, with at least three minions being essential for full efficiency.

**Guiding Wind:** This spell can be used to move a large group of undead into melee combat, or help ranged archers escape from combat. It can also serve as an escape for the tomb priest if it's in melee combat. However, be cautious with the positioning of the spell; enemies within the spell's radius can opt to be moved by it as well.

**Incantation of Protection or Incantation of Zeal:** Prioritize *incantation of zeal* over *incantation of protection* unless enemies are using bludgeoning weapons against skeletons or over half the party consists of martial classes wielding weapons that deal physical damage. In such cases, prioritize *incantation of protection*.

**Black Tentacles or Decrepify:** Cast *black tentacles* when three or more targets are available, or if two targets engage with minions. Be wary; skeletons affected by this spell will incur double damage. If targets are dispersed, use *decrepify*—preferably a martial character with a weak Constitution saving throw.

**Skull Storm:** Use *skull storm* once it can affect three targets. If it can hit two targets, prioritize the spell's bonus action over the tomb priest's Dredge ability. The tomb priest might opt to move alongside the spell to shield itself from ranged attacks. The tomb priest will cease concentration on this spell if the initial storm has moved beyond outside the field of battle or if the spell's bonus action can't affect two or more targets.

#### Lore of Light 
Light tomb priests rely on grouping up their enemies and allies alike to maximize their potency.

**Warding Light:** Cast this as a bonus action when the tomb priest's main action is occupied with something else, such as executing a Disengage maneuver.

**Burning Gaze:** This spell is ideal when it can hit four or more creatures, be they allies or adversaries. If foes are scattered, concentrate *burning gaze* on a single enemy to impose a disadvantage on its saving throw. 

**Dazzling Light & Sunbeam:** These spells are best used when they can affect four or more creatures, whether enemies or allies.

**Flame Strike & Net of Light Combo:** *Flame strike* becomes more lethal when combined with *net of light*. Initiate with *net of light* so that targets caught by it suffer disadvantage on their saves against *flame strike*. Abandon concentration on *net of light* once only two or fewer creatures are trapped within it, especially if the tomb priest has an optimal opportunity to cast *sunbeam*.

#### Lore of Shadow
Shadow tomb priests use debilitating and enhancing spells and utilize their Shadow Paths trait for optimal positioning.

**Shroud of Dusk:** Use this spell against adversaries in melee combat with the tomb priest, then have the tomb priest swap positions with a minion to distance itself from the threat.

**Unseen Lurker:** This should ideally be cast on the tomb priest's most formidable martial minion, then used to swap places with the minion to position it advantageously.

**Withering Resolve:** Target the enemy with the weakest Wisdom save to cripple its capabilities.

**Penumbral Pendulum:** Activate when two or more targets with low Intelligence and Dexterity saves can be caught in its path. If three or more targets are available, cast it, even if they have high Intelligence and Dexterity saves.




\columnbreak

**Mindrazors or Pit of Shadows:** Which of these two spells the tomb priest uses depends on whether it can target two or more enemies with *pit of shadows*, specifically those with low Dexterity saves. If this is not feasible, use *mindrazors*. Abandon concentration on *mindrazors* if an opportunity arises to use *pit of shadows* on two or more targets later.

#### Hieratic Hierarchy
When tomb priests come together to form a hierarchy, they can execute devastating combos by pooling their concentration with junior members, enabling them to channel spells they wouldn't normally use together. Potential combinations are vast, but here are a few notable ones:

**Net of Light & Sunbeam:** This combination can wreak havoc. A hierarchy member capable of casting *net of light* should initiate the sequence, regardless of its power. This should then be followed by the most powerful tomb priest using sunbeam on the trapped creatures.

**Decrepify, Black Tentacles & Skull Storms:** Use *decrepify* to nearly guarantee that targets fail their saving throws against the subsequent *black tentacles* and *skull storm*.

**Impending Doom with Other Casters:** *Impending doom* becomes particularly potent when combined with other spellcasters. Cast it quickly, as it enhances the potency of all the tomb priests' magic, whose spells typically have a low baseline save DCs.

**Withering Resolve & Powerful Spells:** The potency of *withering resolve* is magnified when channeled by multiple casters. Let the more junior members of the hierarchy who can cast it take the lead. Then, the most formidable among them should follow up with a mighty spell such as *penumbral pendulum* or *pit of shadows*.

## War Sphinxes
The war sphinxes stand as towering testaments to the might and ingenuity of the ancient Tomb Kingdoms. These colossal constructs, resembling massive, feline beasts carved from stone, embody the fearsome power and eternal vigilance of their creators. 

Despite their monumental, heavy stone bodies, war sphinxes possess a grace and agility that belies their size. With movements mirroring the predatory cats of the desert, they pounce and shred through enemy ranks, their huge teeth and claws leaving nothing but devastation in their wake. Perhaps most terrifying is their ability to rear up and slam down with thunderous force, pulverizing anything unfortunate enough to be caught beneath.

These majestic constructs are often equipped with war howdahs, battle platforms manned by tomb guards who direct these beasts into the heart of the conflict. From these vantage points, the tomb guards rain arrows upon the enemy while guiding the war sphinxes to maximize their destructive potential. Many pharaohs of the Tomb Kingdoms, ever seeking to demonstrate their might, have personal war sphinxes that guard their inner burial sanctums. In times of war, these pharaohs ride into battle atop their war sphinxes, commanding respect and fear on the battlefield.

The creators of these war sphinxes, master artisans of the Tomb Kingdoms, continually seek to enhance their creations, striving to outdo both themselves and their rivals. As a result, many war sphinxes are not only functional weapons of war but also masterpieces of art. They are often adorned with elaborate ornaments, engravings, and even magical enhancements. Some boast massive, venom-filled scorpion tails, adding a lethal sting to their arsenal, while others are enchanted with fiery roars capable of scorching anything <br> in their path, turning the tide of battle with a single, <br> incendiary breath.

### War Sphinx Enhancments
If you wish to enhance the power of a war sphinx, you can give it one of the following upgrades. Each upgrade increases its CR by 1.

####  Burning Roar
*The war sphinx can let loose a roar that burns the air with the heat of a funeral pyre and the force to shatter bones. The roar's raw power can stop even the most stalwart warriors in their tracks.*
 
The war sphinx gains the Burning Roar action, which it can use in place of its Thunder Crash during a Multiattack.

***Burning Roar (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The war sphinx lets out a roar that burns the air in a 60-foot cone in front of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage plus 17 (5d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 14), it is stunned until the end of the war sphinx's next turn.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br>

#### Envenomed Stinger
*The war sphinx is enhanced with a scorpion's tail, complete with a stinger the size of a man. Its venom causes blood to boil and limbs to freeze.* 


The war sphinx gains the Sting attack action, which it can use in place of one of its attacks during a Multiattack.
 
***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, and the effect ends on a successful one. If the creature fails this repeated saving throw by 5 more (DC 14), it becomes paralyzed until the poison ends.

If the creature fails by 5 or more (DC 14), or automatically fails, it can't stand up until after the end of its next turn. Objects and structures in this area take double the thunder damage dealt.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the sphinx's choice that is within 120 feet of the sphinx and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sphinx's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

### War Sphinx Tactics
War sphinxes are versatile monsters. They can ambush players by sneaking up on them or by remaining motionless and disguising themselves as statues. They can take down single targets with their pounces, or they can use their Thunder Crash to blast groups of enemies.

It's generally best for the war sphinx to start combat by getting a running start to empower its Thunder Crash and use it on the largest group of opponents. If one of them fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it will not be able to stand up, allowing the war sphinx to gain bonus damage on its Bite attack. If it is able to frighten the majority of its enemies with Frightful Presence, it will run off with a grappled target.

#### War Sphinx Enhancement Tactics

War sphinxes are able to gain two of the following upgrades:

**Burning Roar:** This is immediately used when it can hit three or more targets. If any targets are stunned, it will use its Thunder Crash on them.

**Envenomed Stinger:** This is used in place of its Claw attack on a target that is not frightened of the war sphinx. When a more intelligent creature is guiding the war sphinx in battle, it will prioritize using the stinger against creatures with low Constitution.

\columnbreak

### War Sphinx Loot
The valuable items looted from war sphinxes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### War Sphinx Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### War Sphinx Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-10  | 2d4(5) 50gp Items |
|  11-16 | 2d4(5) 100gp Items | 
|  17-23 | 2d8(9) 100gp Items  |  
|  24-26 | 1d6(3) 1,000gp Items |  
|  27+ |  1d6(3) 2,000gp Items | 

#### Example War Sphinx Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.

##### Example War Sphinx Item Names
|1d4 | 50gp | 100gp Item | 1,000gp Item |  2,000gp Item |

## Howdah Mechanics
War howdahs are small armored structured mounted to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use different types of howdahs in your games. They can be applied to howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own howdahs. 

### Howdah Rules
Howdahs are generally structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger war beast of some kind. The creatures within the howdah are referred to as riders, and the creature the howdah is mounted upon is referred to as its steed. If one of the riders is controlling the steed, that creature is the pilot. Howdah riders and steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

#### Movement & Initiative

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a howdah or its steed, the howdah and its steed are moved together.

* **Controlled & Independant Steeds.** The howdah's steed can be a controlled or independent mount as described in the player's handbook. If it is controlled, there must be a pilot who is controlling it.

* **Entering & Exiting Howdahs.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah. Any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. Each passenger already inside the howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.

#### Howdah Saving Throws
While objects normally automatically fail all Strength, Dexterity, and Constituion saving throws, howdahs are active parts of combat, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, you can use the following rules when howdahs are subject to such saving throws.

##### Strength & Dexterity Saves
Howdahs equipped on an unencumbered steed do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as they can rely on their steed to make the save for them. If a howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, its steed must make the saving throw against the effect. If the steed succeeds on the save, the howdah passes the save.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

##### Constitution Saves
Howdahs can make their own Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is mounted on a steed.

#### Opportunity Attacks
When the howdah steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the howdah itself. Passengers cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures outside the howdah.

#### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures inside a howdah are considered to be within 5 feet of each other.

#### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of three of the steed's largest hit dice.

#### Teleporting
If the steed is teleported, the howdah and its riders can choose to teleport with it.

#### Falling Howdahs
When a howdah's steed falls from a height of 10 feet or more, it and all its riders take fall damage as usual, and the riders fall prone.

#### Repairing Howdahs
If a howdah has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting repairs, provided it has the necessary tools and parts. After 1 hour of work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus if proficient with the required tools. On success, the howdah regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. On failure, the howdah doesn't regain any hit points, but repairs can be reattempted with the same tools and parts.

#### Howdah Destruction
When a howdah is destroyed, riders that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of its steed.




\pagebreakNum

### Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, howdahs have the following additional attributes and considerations:

#### Howdah DC 
Whenever the howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, that creature uses this value for the DC.

#### Damage Threshold
Most howdahs possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the howdah takes the damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the howdah's hit points.

####  Steed Size
This is the minimum size a creature must be to be the howdah's steed. If a creature ever becomes too small to carry the howdah, the howdah falls off the creature and is knocked over as though its steed was knocked prone, described in the Prone Howdahs section.

#### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride in the howdah comfortably. Additional creatures may be able to fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the howdah at the DM's discretion.

#### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the howdah adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

#### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning howdah, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the howdah is an additional creature with its own CR.

#### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits the howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

#### Siege Weapons
A howdah may have one or more built-in siege weapons. These siege weapons are built into the howdah and share its Hit Points, AC, and Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the howdah is destroyed. These siege weapons can only be operated by riders in the howdah, and riders can't provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the howdah while operating these weapons. The weapons can't be used if the howdah is not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.
