# Tomb Kingdom Compendium

These beautiful and treacherous environments are a staple in many fantasy adventures. Mountains can serve as imposing impediments to travel as players try to pass them to reach their destination, or they can be the location of the player's goal, serving as a dangerous and dramatic setting for an adventure. Even in the heart of relatively tame and civilized lands, mountains serve as bastions of untamed and unforgiving wilderness, for there are few environments that pose as many hazards to travelers.

This document provides content to help you run games that feature mountains of any shape and size in any environment. This content ranges from character options for players who want their characters to be associated with mountains, to mechanics for running sessions with travel through mountains, to a bestiary of mountain creatures to populate the peaks in your games. Whether the players are only spending a day traveling through mountains or your entire campaign features mountains, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

# Introducing The Tomb Kingdoms

These devious and opportunistic humanoids scurry within the shadowy recesses of other civilizations, where they scheme ways to advance themselves and bring ruin upon their hated enemies.  And the enemies of a ratfolk are many, for most other humanoids view them with fear and disdain.  Thus, ratfolk live hidden within swamps, caves, sewers, or the ruins of other humanoids.  From here, they can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive.  
Some ratfolk find it in their best interest to bargain with and even form alliances with other races.  These alliances are almost always created out of a sense of survivalist pragmatism, and most ratfolk won't hesitate to cast them aside once they are no longer of use.  But some exceptional or desperate ratfolk will find themselves tangled in long-term partnerships with members of other races to achieve common goals.  These ratfolk are almost always adventurers of some sort and can make for useful and dangerous allies.

### Nimble and Devious
Though ratfolk possess natural agility and a vicious bite, they don't typically confront their foes head-on.  Their smaller frames and lack of resources have made ratfolk accustomed to fighting at a disadvantage.  As such, ratfolk rarely believe in fighting fair.  They are twitchy and quick to scurry away if they perceive themselves in a losing fight.  

Skilled ratfolk can use this natural tendency to their advantage as they whittle enemies down with hit and run tactics.  Ratfolk also become more confident when attacking in numbers and quickly become more vicious when they are part of a swarm overwhelming their foes.

If worst comes to worst and they are forced to flee, ratfolk can quickly squeeze their way into tight crevices to escape attackers.  This ability also gives them a substantial combat advantage when fighting in their claustrophobic underground homes, where they can pop from hidden alcoves to attack unsuspecting intruders.

### Bringers of Plague and Ruin
Most ratfolk live brutal lives in which pure survival is prioritized above all else.  The idea of shunning a source of power out of fear of corruption or avoiding tactics because they are dishonorable is absurd to them.  As such, ratfolk are known to be masters of many powers and abilities other races consider sinister.  Many ratfolk become deadly assassins, some possessing a supernatural mastery of their wicked craft.  Others tap into the notoriety of rats for swarming through civilization and spreading plagues.  These ratfolk may become carriers for terrible diseases which they can inflict upon their victims, or they may learn to command swarms of other vermin to overwhelm their foes.  Even ratfolk who pursue power through more conventional martial means utilize fear and underhanded tactics to obtain that power.

\columnbreak

### Crafty Innovators
In their scramble to find new ways to survive, many ratfolk find innovative ways to use the limited resources at their disposal.  These ratfolk make for natural tinkerers, artificers, and engineers, and their creations are built to deliver powerful results at any cost.  This mindset results in many brilliant but perilous designs.  The weapons created by ratfolk are often as dangerous to the wielder as the weapon's target.  Successful engineers have others test their devices for them, only using the most tried and true designs themselves.  

### Ratfolk Names
In some settings, ratfolk take names similar to those of nearby humanoids.  Other times, ratfolk develop naming conventions of their own.  First names are usually short, squeaky, and chittering.  Surnames emphasize imposing traits or deeds, and ratfolk often take on new surnames they find useful for maintaining their status.  Some ratfolk will even discard their first name altogether and only be referred to by an imposing title.  Ratfolk names generally don't distinguish between the genders.
<br>**Ratfolk Names:** Skeetch Plaguebreath, Threk Bonechewer, Rikket Demoneyes, Gutterking, Kreet Craventail, Rotfang

# Running Tomb Kingdom Adventures 

The tomb kingdoms are all that remain of an ancient empire that had grown so powerful it believed it could conquer death. The egos of this empire's pharaohs were such that they could not accept the prospect of their end or that of their kingdom. Thus, incalculable resources went into the study of necromantic magics and the construction of massive statues and necropolises meant to immortalize their kingdom. The rulers of these realms have been preserved along with their armies, and they seek to reclaim the lost glory of their kingdom.

Players are most likely to come into conflict with denizens of the tomb kingdoms while exploring the lands they once ruled. The tombs, temples, and vaults of the tomb kingdoms all make for excellent adventuring locations that pit the players against these eternal warriors. The players may also encounter tomb kingdom forces outside their homes if they are seeking to reclaim lost treasure or exact vengeance on any who earned their ire.


### Tomb Kingdom Motivations


***Tomb Lords.*** The royal lords of the tomb kingdoms are egotistical and self-righteous, with most believing that their empires and territory were given to them by divine right. Tomb lords may adhere to ancient governmental or religious codes. Their behavior may also be dictated by the nature of the magic that caused them to awaken. In all these cases, the tomb lord may behave contrary to its best interest to adhere to these codes or magical compulsions. 

When bringing a tomb lord into your world, you can use these codes of conduct to shape its personality and behavior. A tomb lord may fanatically focus the wrath of its minions on anyone who defaces its sacred monuments, even if they’re not the soundest tactical target. A different tomb lord may be honor-bound to accept duals from a challenging player. Another tomb lord may have awoken from its slumber specifically to exact vengeance on someone who stole a treasure. These quirks can make your tomb lord more memorable and give players personal weaknesses to learn and exploit.

***Tomb Kingdom Minions.*** The motivations of most tomb kingdom minions are fairly straightforward. They exist to serve their kingdom and carry out the will of their undying lords. Most have specific duties they were assigned in ages past, and barring intervention from a tomb lord, they will carry out these duties to the best of their ability.

#### Tomb Kingdom Motivations
* Punish trespassers
* Reclaim lost treasures
* Carry out last received orders
* Reclaim territory formerly held in life
* Exact vengeance for past grievances
* Gather knowledge of necromantic arts
* Rebuild ruined structures or statues
* Carry out wishes of a patron deity

\columnbreak

### Tomb Kingdom Tactics
The armies of the tomb kingdoms are varied, and their tactics will depend on their goals, the environment, and what creatures they have at their disposal. Still, there are some commonalities between many of their creatures. Skeleton warriors are used en masse to distract or overwhelm players, but their methods of attack are usually straightforward. The large construct monsters provide much heavier hitting forces, each serving a more specialized role that can be combined with the more general-purpose skeletons. The leaders of the tomb kingdoms are powerful in their own right, but they rely on their minions to truly shine, each possessing spells or abilities that enhance other undead.





#### Engagement

Most tomb kingdom creatures either lie in wait beneath the sands, or they can appear indistinguishable from inanimate statues. This means tomb kingdom creatures will generally attempt ambushes whenever possible. They are patient and will usually wait to attack until they are spotted or they have the opportunity to attack from an advantageous position. 
When an ambush isn't possible, tomb kingdom creatures march implacably after the players, letting nothing deter them from their goal.


#### Combat

Tomb kingdom creatures and implacable and utterly focused on their objectives in combat. While the exact tactics of each creature vary, the discipline with which the creatures execute their tactics does not. The sophistication and adaptability of different creatures depend on the level of sentience of the highest-ranking creature there. Skeletons acting without a leader may execute their techniques without fail, but they aren't very adaptable. 

When using leaderless statues and low-level soldiers, have them execute their standard tactics and fight to the death regardless of changes to the situation. Leadership from tomb king priests or nobles can allow them to adapt to changing circumstances more easily and better counter whatever the players are attempting.

#### Retreat
Tomb kingdom creatures are entirely fearless and utterly devoted to following any orders given to them. They will never lose their morale or flee and will only retreat when ordered to. The kings and priests may flee to save themselves, but they are unlikely to panic, and many will stubbornly fight to the end if they feel the stakes are high enough. A tomb kingdom ruler who is forced to retreat will undoubtedly hold a grudge and likely seek vengeance in the future, even if it takes years.

# New Player Options
Bleep blee blah blah blah

## New Spells



### Lore of Death

This brand of magic plays on the nature of mortality and fragility of life, though it is strictly distinct from traditional necromancy, as it embraces the inevitability of death rather than attempting to deny it. Its users can manipulate negative energy, sap the vitality of foes, and instill mortal terror in those around them. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Death often wield.

- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Horrifying Laughter

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Wizard
___

You target a creature you can see within range, causing it to collapse into debilitating fits of deranged laughter. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less aren't affected.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration, any creature within 30 feet of the laughing creature that can hear the laughter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the laughing creature until the end of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it stabilizes but remains laughing and can no longer attempt saving throws against the spell. If the spell ends while the creature has 0 hit points, it dies.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

On a failed save, the creature is petrified for the duration. At the end of <br> each of its turns, the target can make another <br> Constitution saving throw. On a success, the <br> spell ends on the target. However, if a creature <br> accumulates three failed saves against this <br> spell (including the initial failed save), it <br> remains petrified indefinitely until the <br> condition is cured by other means.

If a petrified creature is physically <br> damaged or broken during this state, it <br> will manifest the same damage upon <br> being reverted to its original form.

## Lore of <Br> Liche-Priests
This ancient lore of magic was <br> developed by the liche-priests of <br> the long-gone Tomb Kingdom <br> empire. The undying liche-priests <br> are still its primary practitioners, but <br> the secrets of this lore have slipped out <br> into the hands of other desert peoples <br> and arcane archeologists. Its magic <br> focuses on incantations designed to bolster <br> the effectiveness of soldiers, magic that <br> harnesses the power of the desert, and curses <br> that conjure the underworld spirits and punish <br> trespassers. The following spells are examples <br> of the types of magic users of the Lore of <br> Liche-Preists often wield.

#### Cursed Blades
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Warlock

You imbue a weapon within range with the essence of death. When this weapon hits a creature, the target becomes cursed for the spell's duration. At the start of your turn, each creature cursed this way within 90 feet of you takes 1d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional weapon for each slot level above 1st. Using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher increases the damage by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.

#### Decrepify

- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A handful of shriveled weeds)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You attempt to drain the vitality of a creature within range, leaving it feeble and vulnerable. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and its Strength and Dexterity scores reduced to 1. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Constitution saving throw, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration becomes 24 hours and the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a short or long rest. If you use an 8th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled and no longer requires Concentration; the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a long rest.

Creatures can choose to resist and remain stationary instead of being carried by the wind.

*6th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tooth)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock
___

You summon a swirling tempest of skulls in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This whirlwind lasts for the spell's duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The tempest spreads around corners, seeping through openings large enough for a tiny creature.
When you cast the spell, choose a direction. When the storm first appears, and at the start of each of your turns afterward, the swirling skulls move 30 feet in the chosen direction.

\columnbreak



Any creature the storm passes though when moving must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct a cluster of skulls from the storm to streak toward a point you can see within 30 feet of the sphere. Once the skulls reach their destination or hit a solid surface, they lash out, biting at everything nearby. Every creature within 5 feet of where they stopped must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The skulls then return to the storm.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, damage dealt by the storm and the skull clusters increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Tomb Strike
*Necromancy cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock, Wizard
___

You or one of your undead servants lash out with a surge of malignant power. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you or a willing undead creature you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

## Lore of Light
This magic taps into the power of light and its <br> many aspects. Its users not only conjure literal <br> light but can ignite the light in the souls of others, <br> healing or inspiring them. Some magic from this lore <br> even blesses creatures with the ability to move at light <br> speed. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Light often wield.

#### Burning Gaze
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric
___

You fixate on two points within the spell's range, no more than 20 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of searing light erupt from your eyes, blazing between the two points. Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 radiant damage on a failed save. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d6, the radiant damage increases by 1d6, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Dazzling Light
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 fee
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous

You unleash a burst of radiant light at a point you choose within range.

 Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes blinded until the end of your next turn.

#### Holy Nova
*4th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

A burst of divine light emanates from you, enveloping all creatures within 30 feet. Each creature in this area must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 3d6 + your Wisdom modifier radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

You and up to four creatures of your choice within the area automatically succeed on this saving throw, taking no damage. Instead, you and the chosen creatures are bathed in the healing radiance, regaining hit points equal to the total radiant damage dealt.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Mass Haste
*8th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose up to six willing creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, each chosen creature has its speed doubled, gains a +2 bonus to AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and is quickened.


#### Net of Light
*4th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (A white thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Should a creature inside the web attempt to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. A successful save allows the creature to utilize its spell or ability to exit the web, while a failure causes the spell or ability to be expended without effect. Notably, this net of light also extends into the Ethereal Plane, preventing ethereal escape.

A restrained creature can take an action on its turn to attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending its restrained condition on a success.

#### Warding Light
*1st level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (sliver coin)
- **Duration:**  1 round.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin
___

You envelop a creature of your choice within range in a protective radiant light. Until the start of your next turn, the creature illuminates bright light out to a 10-foot radius and dim light out an additional 10 feet. During this time, attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage. This effect doesn't hinder attackers who don't depend on sight, such as those with blindsight or those who cannot be blinded.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. The chosen creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Lore of Shadow
This magic specializes in trickery, illusion, <br> and twisting the minds of its targets. Its <br> users primarily rely on illusory magic, though <br> they also wield spells that manipulate shadows <br> and even the nature of space and time as others <br> are able to perceive it, constantly leaving their <br> foes seconding guessing what they're seeing. <br> The following spells are examples of the types <br> of magic users of the Lore of Shadow often wield.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet

- **Range:** 30 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Warlock
___

You envelop up to three weapons you can see within range in phantasmal shadows, allowing them to slice through the minds of their targets. For the duration, when a creature is hit by an attack from one of these infused weapons, it takes an additional 1d12 psychic damage.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

#### Mirror Dance
*2nd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self 
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

The creature must be no more than one size category larger than you. The spell fails if either of you would appear in a space that cannot accommodate your size.

#### Mystifying Miasma
*2nd-level illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Ranger, Bard
___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 

This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Penumbral Pendulum
*4th-level illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You conjure a spectral pendulum that swings through a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, and 5-foot-tall line of your choice within range. Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot.

#### Pit of Shadows
*6th-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black cloth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

#### Shroud of Dusk
___
*1st-level evocation*

- **Classes:**   Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You release a surge of chilling shadows in a 15-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 1d10 cold damage, and on a failed save, and half as much on a success.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Unseen Lurker
*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

Choose a willing creature you can see within range. The chosen creature becomes enveloped in a shroud of mist, enabling it to move with unseen swiftness. Until the start of your next turn, the creature's movement speed is doubled, it's quickened, and it becomes invisible along with everything it's wearing or carrying.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 3rd.

#### Withering Resolve
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

## Tomb Kingdom <br> Magic Items

The priests and artisans of Tomb Kingdoms produced countless magical items during their empire's heyday. These relics now linger in the crumbling ruins dotted throughout their realm. Many leaders among the Tomb Kingdoms call upon the ancient power of these items when they awaken for battle, and this power is sought after by adventurers throughout the world.

The following magic items can be used to represent some of the magical items players may come across while encountering the Tomb Kingdoms in their adventures.


#### Amulet of Nullification
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement), 5,000gp*<br>
While wearing this amulet, all magic items within 5 ft. of you are subjected to the effects of the *antimagic field* spell. This effect also applies to magic items being worn or carried by creatures within 5 ft. of you.

#### Collar of The Exalted
*Wondrous item, very rare, 6,000gp*<br>
This collar was worn by only the most worthy of leaders who gladly threw away their followers' lives to save their own.

When you take damage while wearing this collar, you can use your reaction to choose a willing creature within 10 feet to take the damage instead. The damage that the creature takes can't be negated or resisted in any way.



#### Hieratic Jar 
*Wondrous item, varies*<br>

These canopic jars were used by the liche priests of the Tomb Kingdoms to store the remains of their deceased peers, from which they could draw upon magic the dead spellcaster knew in life.

After performing a 10-minute ritual, you can store the remains of a creature within this jar. The jar can only store the remains of one creature at a time. If the creature could cast spells in life, choose one of its spells of 1st level or higher that can be cast as an action or bonus action and does not require components consumed by the spell. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

While the jar holds these remains, you can cast the chosen spell by using an action to open the lid (which can be done as part of any somatic components the spell may have.) After casting the spell, if the remains belong to a creature that was hostile to you or recognized you as an enemy in life, the creature's lingering animosity forces you to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to maintain control of its remains. On a failure, the remains are destroyed by the corrosive resentment of the former creature. 

Once a spell has been cast from the jar, it can't be used in this manner again until the next dawn.

Some rare versions of this jar can contain more potent spells and may have a higher spell saving throw DC and attack bonus. These jars also have higher saving throw DCs to contain the power of a resentful creature's remains.



##### Hieratic Jar Levels
|Max Spell Level  | Save DC for Spells and the Jar| Spell Attack Bonus | Rarity | Cost (gp) |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:| :---------:|  :---------:|

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word
*Scroll, very rare, 640 gp* <br>
As a reaction to seeing a spell being cast with a verbal component, you can draw this scroll and read its incantations in an attempt to prevent its casting. The caster must make a concentration saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fails and has no effect as the caster's mouth is filled with biting scarabs, which deal 1d8 piercing damage per level of the spell that was being cast and prevent the caster from speaking until the start of their next turn.

#### Spell Bane Canopic Jar
*Wondrous item, varies*<br>
This canopic jar contains the remains of a high liche priest who jealously wished to stamp out all magic beyond his own.

As an action, you can open the lid of the kanopi, causing it to emit a swirling vortex that attempts to absorb any magic in the area. Every creature, object, and magical effect with 30 ft. is subjected to the effects of *dispel magic*. Spells caught in this area that are higher than 3rd level are unaffected. For every 2 effects dispelled this way, you can regain a 1st level spell slot.

Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until dawn of the following day.

Some rarer kanpoi can provide more potent effects, allowing them to dispel more powerful effects and grant their users higher-level spell slots.

##### Spell Bane Canopic Jar Levels
| Level of *Dispel Magic* Effect  | Level of Spell Slots Regained| Rarity | Cost (gp) |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:| :---------:|
|  3  | 1 | Rare | 2,600 |

|  8  | 4 | Legendary | 54,400 |
|  9  | 4 | Legendary | 105,600 |


#### Staff of the Grand Hierophant

*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 2,000gp*

This ancient staff is inscribed with the names of ancient gods, granting its wielder enhanced mastery over magical energies.

While holding the staff and casting a spell that requires concentration, you can allow a willing creature within 60 feet of you that you can see to also concentrate on that spell. The spell won't end if you lose concentration, provided the other creature maintains its concentration. However, the assisting creature will lose concentration if:

* It moves 60 or more feet away from you
* It loses line of sight with you
* You begin concentrating on a different spell

#### Vambraces of the Sun
*Wondrous item, uncommon, 1,000gp*<br>
This pair of bracers are blessed by an ancient sun god, and each is marked with a jeweled sun emblem capable of releasing a ray of blinding light. 


When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing bracers to shoot a flash of light at the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature. Each bracer can use this ability once (allowing you two uses in total) and can't do so again until dawn of the next day.

# Chariots

Chariots are iconic vehicles of war, allowing mighty steeds to pull soldier-filled carriages into battle. The number of steeds able to pull a chariot and the number of riders its carriage can support varies from one vehicle to the next. Some are even designed to be pulled by creatures other than horses. Chariots may charge headlong into enemy forces or ride past foes who are then dispatched by scythed wheels and spear-wielding riders. They are often a status symbol, and many warrior generals lead their armies from them. In some cultures, chariots are used for racing or other gladiatorial sporting events. 

The following rules can help you codify ways to use chariots in your games. They can be applied to chariots of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own chariots. The rules here can be applied to most vehicles pulled by other creatures, such as wagons and carriages. At the end of the document, there are some example chariots you can incorporate into your own games.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.



#### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, chariots are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The chariot may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by steeds.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.



> ##### Determining Chariot CR
>When building your own chariot, you can determine its CR using most of the creature creation guidelines described in the DMG with the following modifications:
> * Determine its Offensive CR using additional damage per round it grants to its riders and steeds.
> * Determine its Defensive CR using half its HP.
> * Consider other traits it has the same way you would consider creature attributes.

## Tomb Chariots & Cavalry
The ancient tomb kingdoms were masters of using warhorses to gain the edge over their more primitive opponents. These steeds were so prized they were entombed with their riders when they died. When the legions of the tomb kingdoms rise to make war once more, their loyal steeds rise with them and ride out to meet any enemy foolish enough to stand against the deathless legions.

You can use the stats for the warhorse skeleton from the Monster Manual to represent most of these steeds and have them serve as mounts for any of the tomb kingdom infantry.

### Chariots of The Dead

Not only were the tomb kingdoms masters of mounted combat, but they were also among the first civilizations to use chariots in warfare. Because the tomb kings were seen as divine beings, it was forbidden for them to sully themselves by riding on the back of an animal. As such, war chariots were created to carry them into battle, where they could move between important locations to deliver instructions and charge vulnerable foes. War chariots soon came to be seen as a symbol of status among the royalty, with the most powerful tomb kings able to field legions of thundering chariots to crush their foes. 

Great care was taken to preserve these chariots for use in the afterlife, and when the undying tomb legions march to battle, these chariots thunder alongside them. The chariots almost serve as an extension of their undead charioteer’s will, and they are utilized by tomb soldiers and royalty alike with terrifying results. 

Rules for chariots can be found at the end of the document.

# Tomb Kingdom Compilation

This document contains a compilation of ancient Egyptian-inspired undead and construct creatures that you can use to represent the undying forces of a long-lost tomb kingdom. These forces range from lowly skeletal soldiers to towering spirit-powered statues and tyrannical tomb kings.

## Tomb Kingdoms Infantry

Deep within ancient tombs and buried under sandy dunes lie forgotten legions whose loyalty to their bygone kingdoms and undying lords transcends death. These soldiers swore to continue their service into the afterlife and died with their weapons and armor in hand to ensure they would always be ready to answer the call of their eternal lords.

When the undying priests and monarchs of antiquity make war, they summon these regiments of unbreakable undead warriors who tirelessly carry out the orders of their superiors. These skeletal soldiers have forgotten most of their former identities, retaining only their training and their sense of unwavering duty. In battle, they execute the commands of their superiors with flawless devotion, never flinching in the face of danger as they carry out their eternal service.

### Skeletal Infantry
These undead represent the most numerous and lowest-ranking soldiers of the tomb king armies. They were given only the most rudimentary of burial rites, resulting in almost none of their former personality surviving. They possess only the knowledge and skills needed to serve as efficient and loyal soldiers. Though they cannot speak, they can understand and carry out orders with flawless efficiency. Each skeletal regiment retains the years of training and experience with its weapons and combat role that it had in life, and the long years have not dulled their skills.

#### Skeletal Spearmen
These soldiers make up the backbone of most tomb king armies. They march in seemingly endless ranks of bone and bronze, wielding ancient spears and impaling every foe before them. Though they are not the most powerful soldiers, they make up for this with numbers and unshakable resolve. Skeletal spearmen will fight against even the most overwhelming odds, never fleeing and fighting to the last soldier. 

##### The Scorpion Legion
The spearmen of this notorious legion are known for crafting their spears from the tails of deadly desert scorpions. These skeletal soldiers wield their venomous weapons with brutal skill, and foes that survive the initial stab will often succumb to the poisonous aftereffects. 

#### Skeletal Archers
These warriors served as the ranged support to their ancient armies. Armed with bows and an ever-ready supply of bronze-tipped arrows, these archers rained death on their foes to wound and demoralize armies before they could even engage in melee combat. In death, these archers continue to fulfill their ancient role, unleashing streams of arrows with no thought other than to carry out the orders of their eternal masters.

##### The Hawk Legion
These renowned archers were not only expertly trained soldiers but devoted disciples of the hawk god, whose domains were discernment and the hunt. In exchange for their devotion, the hawk god granted them his heightened senses and blessed their arrows such that they would unerringly find their quarry, regardless of any obstacle.

### Tomb Warriors
In life, these soldiers were among the most fanatically loyal to their monarch. These warriors eschewed the protection of a shield and spear, instead duel-wielding curved blades known as khopeshes to maximize their killing potential. Their khopesh blades allow them to knock weapons out of their foes’ grips, potentially sending them flying out of reach. These warriors then ruthlessly cut down their defenseless victims before continuing their bloody rampage. Tomb warriors have lost none of their fervor in death and continue to charge headlong into battle, headless of any danger.

#### Netherworld Legion
When mortals died and passed into the afterlife, it was said their souls would be judged by the discerning gaze of the god of the underworld. Those who displeased this god or were found unworthy would be cast down to the netherworld to suffer for eternity. However, some warriors could bargain for a better fate by offering their service as enforcers of their god’s will in the mortal realm. 

This netherworld legion of warriors can be summoned by those who curry favor with the god of the underworld. Even in the land of the living, they are spectral warriors who flicker in and out of the Material Plane. Their otherworldly nature can even transfer into objects they disarm from foes, preventing their retrieval. And when these warriors are defeated and banished back to the netherworld, they can leave a lingering curse that partially unmoors mortals from the Material Plane.

> ***Curse of the Netherworld.*** When the skeleton dies, it curses each non-undead creature within 10 feet of it, forcing each of those creatures to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail) or be cursed for 1 minute. A creature cursed this way has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws, has the skeleton's Etherealness bonus action, has the skeleton's Ethereal Sight trait, and gains a fly speed of 15 ft. with the ability to hover.
>
>  As an action, a cursed creature can repeat the saving throw to attempt to end the curse. If a creature would return to Material Plane in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, it is immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it is moved.   
>
> ***Ethereal Sight.*** The skeleton can see 60 ft. into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
>
> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The skeleton can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.***  The skeleton makes two spectral khopesh attacks. If both attacks hit the same creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop an object of the skeleton's choice. The object lands at the creature's feet, and if the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 8), the skeleton can have the object flung up to 10 feet away from the creature in the direction of the skeleton's choice. The skeleton can choose for the flung item to enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. The item returns to the plane it was shunted from after 1 minute.
>
> ***Spectral Khopesh.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  12 (3d6 + 2) force damage.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Etherealness.*** The skeleton enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
>




> ##### Option Rules: Binding Curses or Longer lasting Curses
>If you're running an adventure where your players turning ethereal and being able to move through objects would be problematic, you can modify the curse so that creatures under its effects can't move, be moved, or be teleported more than 30 feet away from where the skeleton that cursed them died. On the flip side, if you want to make the curse a key part of how players explore an adventure location, you can extend its duration.

### Tomb Guard
These soldiers served as elite infantry and personal guards to their kings. As a reward for their service, they were granted more elaborate burial rites upon their death. Though these rites were nowhere near the complexity of those reserved for royalty, they allowed the tomb guard to retain some semblance of their personality into undeath. In addition to being excellent soldiers and bodyguards, these soldiers are capable of verbal communication, abstract reasoning, and carrying out higher-level strategic plans. They answer directly to their kingdom’s rulers and ensure their will is carried out in the field of battle. 

#### Eternal Guard
Though all tomb guard legions consider themselves to be “eternal,” this legion takes the expression to the extreme by courting the favor of their death god in exchange for regenerative abilities. This blessed regeneration allows the enteral guard to suffer devastating assaults and rise again to ruthlessly cut down those who thought they could best the elite soldiers of the death god. Such is their tenacity that they don’t bother with using shields for protection and instead duel-wield khopeshes so they may better cut down their comparatively fragile foes.

The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these undead soldiers in your games:

##### Tomb Kingdom Infantry Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The players find an artifact deep in a crypt protected by necromantic wards. As they attempt to bypass its defenses, the artifact awakens waves of skeletal soldiers who threaten to overwhelm them.|
|  2  |The players search a coastal desert for buried treasures lost to shipwrecks over the years. However, the sands also hide skeletal soldiers ready to awaken the moment they’re disturbed.  |
|  3  | The players explore an impossible underground labyrinth patrolled by netherworld warriors. By purposely exposing themselves to the nether-curse of these warriors, the players can ethereally explore the otherwise untraversable dungeon.   |
|  4  | The players come across a battlefield where legions of skeletal soldiers clash against one another, continually reassembling and marching back into the fray as they are destroyed.|

> ##### Mummy Soldiers
> Mummy Soldiers
The skeletal soldiers and tomb warriors presented here are assumed to be more skeletal than mummy-like and, as such, have a weakness to bludgeoning damage rather than fire damage. If you wish to flavor these minions as being lesser mummies, you can change their bludgeoning weakness to fire weakness.

### Royal Warhorse Mummy
Most steeds were preserved using the same rituals as common soldiers. However, like their human counterparts, greater rites of preservation were used for those of greater status. The most prized steeds kept by the ancient royalty were given proper rituals of mummification when they died. When these steeds return to the land of the living, they do so with the unnatural vitality and terrifying powers of their royal masters. 

In war, mummified warhorses serve as steeds for the most elite tomb soldiers and pull the chariots of the tomb royalty. Their cursed hooves doom any they strike, and their terrifying equine glare breaks the will of all but the most resolute soldiers. Never tiring of their duty, these elite steeds work in tangent with their undying riders to destroy any that stand against their terrifying charge.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
>
> ***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 9), it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.

### Desert Storm Riders
The skeletal cavalry of the tomb legions are often used as outriders to harass and harry foes using their speed in conjunction with guerilla warfare. The most feared of these outriders are the legendary Desert Storm riders. This legion of horsemen were notorious for their ability to sweep up great clouds of sand as they rode, which they would use as cover to enable disorienting hit-and-run attacks.

These riders' regiments included melee warriors for running down vulnerable foes and skilled archers for picking apart enemies from a distance. Together, they would often act as a vanguard force that would throw enemy forces into disarray while kicking up great clouds of dust that would make it hard to target or identify the rest of the approaching tomb kingdom army. After the enemy army was broken and routed, the Storm Riders would run down fleeing soldiers, brutely slaying them during their panicked retreat. 

In their new unlife, these riders continue to serve their kingdom, patrolling the desert and running down any would-be intruders. Many adventuring expeditions into the realm of the tomb kingdoms have been cut short by these merciless cavalrymen.

## Ushabti

The people of the ancient tomb kingdoms <br> worshipped pantheons of gods who were <br> said to blend aspects of animal and <br> human. They possessed the heads of <br> powerful desert beasts, the bodies of <br> humans, and each presided over their <br> respective domains. The people of <br> these kingdoms created many imposing <br> statues of these deities, and when their <br> priests learned how to preserve and bind <br> the spirits of the fallen, they began the <br> practice of enshrining the spirits of their <br> most powerful warriors within these statues. <br> Known as ushabti, they stand watch over the <br> most important temples and necropolises <br> of the tomb kingdoms, where they remain <br> motionless but ever vigilant. 

Ushabtis awaken only when they detect <br> intruders or hear the summons of a <br> powerful tomb priest. In either case, they <br> stride into battle, wielding giant ornate <br> weapons, from intricately etched blades <br> capable of cutting a horse in half to gilded <br> longbows with blessed arrows the size of <br> spears. Ushabtis use their weapons with ease, <br> cutting a swath through would-be intruders and <br> invaders, making them the perfect sentries and <br> monstrous soldiers for their eternal kingdom.

&emsp;***Chosen of the Gods.*** These ushabtis are <br> possessed by the spirits of mighty archers who <br> have earned the blessings of their gods. While <br> all ushabtis utilize blessed arrows, these <br> warriors are capable of performing miraculous <br> feats with their divine ammunition, such as <br> raining volleys of radiant arrows down upon <br> foes in a deadly barrage. The elevated rank of <br> these archers means they are available only to <br> the most powerful of tomb lords and employed <br> for only the most important of duties, such as <br> providing ranged support in critical battles or <br> protecting the most sacred of temples.

***Soul Wardens.*** These ushabtis are built to <br> imprison the souls of those who have earned a <br> special ire from the tomb lords. They are capable <br> of tearing out the souls of their victims and <br> trapping them within their construct bodies. <br> Some transport the souls of the victims to their <br> masters for further punishment, but many serve <br> as a prison for the soul of an especially powerful transgressor, such as a traitorous priest, <br> renegade necromancer, or even a powerful <br> demon. The presence of a tomb warden serves <br> as a grim reminder to would-be tomb robbers <br> that a fate worse than death awaits them should <br> they fall into the clutches of these dreaded <br> guardians.

If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become incapacitated and have its speed become 0 as the ushabti begins ripping the target's soul from its body. This effect ends if the ushabti dies, is incapacitated, or uses this ability again. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the creature fails the repeated saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the ushabti until it the ushabti dies or traps another soul. While a creature's soul is trapped, it can't be resurrected. <br> If a creature is struck by this attack again while already incapacitated by its effect, it doesn't make another save, but instead makes its next save against the effect with disadvantage.

## Bone Giant

Though these mighty beings appear to be the skeletons of enormous giants, they are, in fact, constructs carved from wood and stone. In ancient times, they were created as monumental tributes to legendary kings and heroes. As the death priests learned to bind souls and manipulate the death, they began binding powerful spirits to these statues. These spirits remain dormant for ages at a time until they are called upon to serve their lost kingdom. 

When they're stirred into action, bone giants draw huge bows and unleash blessed arrows the size of a ballista bolt capable. Even those who manage to overcome the sheer terror of the bone giant's presence and engage it in close quarters will still need to contend with melee attacks capable of pulverizing most humanoids in a single blow. And those who survive long enough to land a blow will be unlikely to overcome the defenses of its nearly indestructible frame.

## Titan of the Gods

These massive ornate constructs were built to serve as conduits to the netherworld. They preside over the tombs of ancient kings, ensuring they are guided to the afterlife. In one hand, they wield a massive sun staff that lights the way through the netherworld and allows them to unleash solar rays through their burning eyes. In the other hand, they carry a set of scales used to judge the worthiness of souls and rip apart the life force of those still living. 

When stirred to battle, the titan of the gods serves as an avatar of the divine that walks the mortal realm. Its connection to the realm of the gods allows divine beings to hear the prayers and rituals beseeching them for power more clearly. Those who draw on the gods for power find they can more freely call upon that power in the presence of this titan, and the titan serves as a messenger to communicate the gods' will to their supplicants.

## Tomb Lords
These monarchs ruled vast <br> kingdoms when civilization was <br> still young. Their ruthless ambition <br> saw them conquer huge territories <br> and amass untold troves of wealth. <br> Their egos were such that they saw <br> themselves as above death. So, they <br> had themselves mummified so they <br> could rule their kingdoms for eternity. <br> However, they’ve awoken to find their <br> bodies as shriveled husks and their kingdoms <br> crumbling and pillaged of treasures. Though <br> they still possess immense physical might, they <br> can no longer enjoy the sensations of life. Though they <br> still have many riches, much of it was stolen. Though they still have loyal subjects, they are undead minions only possessing a shadow of their former selves.

The rage at what they’ve lost and their desire to retake <br> what they feel the afterlife owes them drives the tomb <br> lords ruthlessly reclaim their territory and punish any trespassers in their domain. This indomitable will <br> manifests itself in their undead subjects, who become <br> much more formidable in the presence of their lord.

***Chosen of the Gods.*** The monarchy of these <br> long-lost kingdoms claimed to be divinely blessed, if <br> not the direct descendants of gods themselves. Those <br> struck by tomb lords experience direct evidence to <br> back this claim, for these undying monarchs strike <br> with the divine fury of their patron gods. This blessing <br> may come in the form of poisonous strikes, attacks <br> enhanced with solar radiance, or an onslaught so <br> vicious it mentally scars victims and forces them to <br> drop to their knees in prostration. 

The most sinister of these divine manifestations is <br> not a blessing on the tomb lord but a curse on anyone <br> who strikes it down. These curses reflect the gods <br> who favored the tomb lord and may leave victims <br> racked with poison, unable to recall learned <br> knowledge, or feeling the inevitable pull of death <br> tugging at their souls.

***Tomb Princes.*** Most members of ancient royalty <br> were not destined for the throne. The sons of mighty monarchs who were not heirs to the throne served as commanders and enforcers for their father’s will. <br> Many strive to earn favor with their king, performing <br> deeds in his name as they jockey for positions in the <br> royal hierarchy. Others seek to gather enough power <br> to dethrone their father and take his place at the <br> head of an undying kingdom of their own.

### Additional Curses of the Gods

Many tomb lords have a specific god they regard as their patron. These gods enact divine punishments on those who strike the tomb lord down in a unique way that makes it clear which deity has been angered. You may replace the effects of the tomb prince’s or tomb king’s Vengeful Curse with one of the following curses.

#### Curse of Death's Grip
This is the most common curse tomb lords inflict and is the default curse listed in their stat blocks. The curse is inflicted by gods associated with death and funerary rites. Those under its effect feel the inevitable pull of the grave tugging at their soul.

While cursed this way, the target automatically fails any death saving throws it makes and treats the roll as if it rolled a 1.

#### Curse of the Glaring Sun
Many of the greatest kings of old claimed to be blessed by, or even descendent from, the god of the sun. Those who cut down these monarchs are cursed by the sun’s perpetual glare. 

Whenever a creature cursed this way is in direct sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

#### Curse of the Lost Lessons
Some monarchs made gods of knowledge their patron deities in hopes of receiving their wisdom. Those who earn the ire of these gods soon find themselves stripped of such wisdom.

The cursed creature can't add its proficiency bonus to skill checks, tool checks, or saving throws.

#### Curse of the Marked Prey
Monarchs who were fierce warriors and hunters earned the favor of gods of the wild. Those cursed by such gods become easy prey to their enemies. 

Weapon attacks against the cursed creature can't suffer from disadvantage.


#### Curse of the Serpent's Kiss
The cursed creature loses any immunity or resistance it has to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Additionally, if this curse originated from a tomb prince, and the creature takes any piercing, slashing, or poison damage, the creature takes an additional 2(1d4) poison damage. If the curse originated from a tomb king, it instead takes an additional 4 (1d8) poison damage.

### Additional Magic Strikes

If you wish to replace the effects of the Tyrannical <br> Strike ability for a tomb prince or tomb king, you <br> can use one of the following effects instead. The <br> save DC for a tomb prince is 15, and for a tomb <br> king, it’s 17. The tomb monarch in the descriptions <br> refers to the tomb prince or tomb king with this <br> ability.

#### Nullifying Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an <br> additional 10 (3d6) force damage. Once per turn, when <br> the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a <br> Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops <br> an object of the tomb monarch’s choice, and the tomb monarch can have the object flung up to 10 feet away in <br> the direction of its choice. If the object is magical, its <br> magical properties are suppressed for the next minute. 
 
#### Siphoning Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains a level of exhaustion, and the tomb monarch gains advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. These effects last until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. 
 
#### Sun Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) radiant damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. 

#### Tyrannical Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) psychic damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature falls prone in prostration and is frightened of the tomb monarch until the end of the tomb monarch's next turn or until the tomb monarch is incapacitated. While frightened this way, the target can't stand up.

#### Venom Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. While it is poisoned this way, if it fails another saving throw against a poison effect, it becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.

## Tomb Swarms
In the unforgiving sands of the desert and the echoing silence of ancient crypts, a menace lurks unseen. A creeping, crawling, writhing menace emerges from the very ground to consume and annihilate those who dare to trespass on the sacred grounds of the Tomb Kingdoms.

Tomb Swarms resemble a horrifying cascade of skeletal and desiccated small desert creatures, moving as one, with the sole intent of overwhelming their prey. From a distance, they might appear like shifting sands, but upon closer inspection, one can discern the countless creatures that form these swarms, their tiny bones, carapaces, and withered forms glistening under the desert sun or the dim torchlight of a crypt.

***Swarm Composition.*** Comprised of a myriad of smaller undead beings, Tomb Swarms are most notably made up of scarabs and scorpions, though various other small creatures might be found within the mix. Each creature, though small and seemingly insignificant on its own, becomes a formidable force when part of the swarm.


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br>

The scarabs are especially feared for their gruesome method of attack, burrowing into the flesh of their unfortunate victims. Once inside, they consume their prey from the inside out, causing immense pain and inevitable death.

The undead scorpions inject a potent necrotic venom with each sting. The poison not only causes excruciating pain but also debilitates the victim, making counterattacks nearly impossible.

***Deadly Ambushers.*** The Tomb Swarms do not exist by mere chance. They are animated by the ambient magic wielded by the liche-priests of the Tomb Kingdoms. In combat, these swarms serve as perfect ambushers, bursting forth from beneath the sands or creeping out of shadowed crypt corners, taking enemies by surprise. 

With an appetite that seems insatiable, Tomb Swarms will skeletonize their surprised prey. The speed at which they devour flesh and bone is unnatural, leaving behind only empty armor and weapons, a grim testament to their efficiency.

### Tomb Swarm Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these undead beasts in your games:

##### Tomb Swarm Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Scarab Gem:** An infamous gem, said to be cursed, resurfaces in the market. Anyone who possesses it is found dead, their body grotesquely skeletonized. The adventurers are tasked with tracing the gem's origin and dealing with tomb swarms it summons.|
|  2  |**Lost to the Swarm:** An earlier expedition into the Tomb Kingdoms has not returned. The adventurers are tasked with finding them. As they explore deeper into the ancient ruins, they find evidence of the expedition's encounters with tomb swarms.  |
|  3  | **Master of the Swarm:** A rogue necromancer seeks to control the tomb swarms for their own nefarious goals. As they conduct dark rituals to bend the swarms to their will, the adventurers must intervene, navigating through the chaos of swarming undead.  |
|  4  | **The Desiccated Oasis:** A once-lush oasis is now completely dry. Those who ventured to investigate never returned. But their last messages spoke of the ground awakening with swarming undead creatures.|

### Tomb Swarm Tactics
Tomb swarms are made up of a mass of mindless undead creatures acting with just enough collective intelligence to maintain a unified cohesion as they hunt. Beyond this, they are mindless in their tactics. They remain hidden in crevasses or underground until they detect prey, then they burst forth for a surprise attack. They focus on attacking the closest prey available, using their numbers to overwhelm and devour their victim.

When in the service of the tomb kingdoms, they act as ambushers designed to surprise and distract high-priority targets such as spell casters.

\columnbreak

### Tomb Swarm Loot
The valuable items looted from tomb swarms will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Swarm Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Tomb Swarm Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | 2d6(7) 5sp Items |
|  6-9 | 3d6(10) 5sp Items | 
|  10-17 | 2d6(7) 1gp Items  |  
|  18-21 | 3d6(10) 1gp Items  |  
|  22+ |  2d6(7) 2gp Items | 


##### Large Tomb Swarm Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 5d6(17) 5sp Items |
|  8-11 | 6d6(21) 5sp Items | 
|  12-19 | 5d6(17) 1gp Items  |   
|  20-23 | 6d6(21) 1gp Items  |  
|  24+ |  5d6(17) 2gp Items | 


#### Example Tomb Swarm Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.

##### Example Tomb Swarm Item Names
 5sp Item | 1gp Item | 2gp Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
 |   Cracked Tomb Carapaces | Tomb Carapaces  |  Pristine Tomb Carapaces  |

## Tomb Carrion
In the shadowed dunes and desolate plains of the eternal desert lie the remnants of the once-glorious Tomb Kingdoms. These vast lands are inhabited not only by the buried undead legions but also by the chilling specters of the skies: the tomb carrion.

Tomb carrion are monstrous, reanimated vultures bearing an unholy union of decayed flesh and preserved remains. The scale of these creatures is intimidating, with wingspans reaching that of several men laid end to end. Their desiccated skin clings tightly to their skeletal form, and their lifeless eyes gleam with an eerie light, signaling the dark magic that reanimates them.

In days of old, the giant carrion vultures were revered creatures, considered sacred to the denizens of the Tomb Kingdoms. Seen as messengers and intermediaries between the mortal realm and the heavens, they were embalmed upon their death and preserved with archaic rituals. Thus, the vast necropolises of the empire, home to its departed rulers and warriors, became the resting place for countless such vultures.

The Tomb Kingdoms may have been long silent, but they are far from lifeless. The powerful liche-priests, guardians of ancient rituals and forbidden magics, possess the capability to awaken the embalmed vultures. Summoned forth from their aeons of slumber, the tomb carrion soar the skies once more, providing invaluable aerial support to the ground-bound legions of the undead.

These creatures are not mere tools of war. They are deadly hunters of the arid desert, preying on wanderers and creatures already enfeebled by the scorching sun and relentless sandstorms. With dread inevitability, they descend upon the vulnerable, leaving little but bones in their wake.

But the tomb carrion have evolved beyond mere talons and beaks as weapons. Through the dark rituals that bind them, they've gained the ability to spew forth a vile, necrotic filth. This foul substance weakens their prey, sapping them of strength and vitality, rendering them all the easier to subdue.

Among the tomb carrion, there are those that stand a class apart. These are the blessed ones, chosen by the very gods of the Tomb Kingdoms. These sacred creatures are not only larger and more formidable, but they also possess the unique ability to release torrents of necrotic filth from high above. Like unholy bombers, they soar the heavens, raining down decay and death upon the enemies of the Tomb Kingdoms.

The tomb carrion are a testament to the enduring might and dark majesty of the Tomb Kingdoms. As long as the liche-priests chant their spells and the necropolises stand, these creatures of dread will continue to haunt the desert skies, symbols of an empire that refuses to fade into the annals of history.

### Tomb Carrion Tactics
These vulturous undead specialize in harrying their prey and picking off the weak. 

When operating independently, tomb carrion will track down desert-traveling players suffering from exhaustion and attempt to swoop in to finish them off. They usually initiate with their Spew Filth and then focus their attacks on whoever has the most levels of exhaustion. They will typically stop their attacks to use Feast whenever the opportunity presents itself.

When working with other Tomb Kingdom forces, they will harass and weaken players, focusing on which ever player the other Tomb Kingdom forces may be having the most trouble reaching. They are also good at helping Tomb Kingdom forces catch fleeing foes.

The sacred carrion fight in much the same way as their other kin. The biggest difference is that they have Filth Bombardment rather than Spew Filth. This ability allows sacred carrion to weaken their prey from afar before having to move in closer, where they risk facing stronger counterattacks.

### Tomb Carrion Loot
The valuable items looted from tomb carrion will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Carrion Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Tomb Carrion Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-8  | 1 5gp Item |
|  9-12 | 1d4(2) 5gp Items  |  
|  12-16| 1 10gp Item  |  
|  17+| 1d4(2) 10gp Items  |  



##### Sacred Carrion Loot Table

|  11-16 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items  |  
|  17-21 | 1d4(2) 20gp Items  |  
|  22+ |  1d6(3) 20gp Items | 


#### Example Tomb Carrion Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.

## Liche-Priests

In the heart of the vast desert, where timeless pyramids touch the sky and ancient secrets lay buried beneath golden sands, the liche priests stand as the eternal custodians of the Tomb Kingdoms. Theirs is the lore of life, death, and the shadowy realm that lies between.

***Spiritual Stewards.*** Liche priests were not merely mages or scholars; they were the religious leaders of the Tomb Kingdoms. Entrusted with the divine responsibility of ensuring their pharaohs and royalty achieved immortality, these priests were the masterminds behind the intricate preservation of both the rulers and their vast armies. They mummified bodies, sealed tombs with arcane runes, and ensured that even in death, the grandeur of their kingdom persisted.

***Eternal Vigil.*** The liche priests were tasked with discovering the ultimate mystery: transcending death itself. Through their relentless search for arcane knowledge, they found a way to trap their souls within their withering bodies, thus escaping death's final embrace. This, however, became both their greatest achievement and curse. Over the ages, their once-robust forms have withered into skeletal husks. Their skin is stretched tight over bone, and their eyes, once full of vigor, now glow with an eerie, unending light.

***Awakeners of the Dead.*** The vast silent legions of the Tomb Kingdoms can be roused to life via the incantations of the liche priests. Using ancient rituals, they learned to call back the spirits of their royalty, imbuing mummified corpses with new unlife. Likewise, they can awaken entire preserved armies, ready to march and fight once again under the banners of their eternal kingdom.

***Divine Arcanists.*** Every spell, every invocation, and every ritual the liche priests perform is a homage to their deities. They believe their power flows directly from the gods they worship. Their magic, diverse and potent, is recorded meticulously in ancient tomes, books, and scrolls of papyrus. These texts are treasures in their own right, containing secrets that have shaped the destiny of the Tomb Kingdoms.

***Hierarchy of Eternity.*** Among the liche priests, rank and structure are paramount. From the lowliest acolyte studying the first mysteries of death to the high priests who hold secrets as old as the sands themselves, there is a clear hierarchy. When these eternal priests congregate, their combined power, channeled through sacred rituals, can alter the very fabric of reality, making them a formidable force in both the realms of magic and governance.

### Optional Rule: Hieratic Hierarchy

When several Tomb Kingdom priests collaborate in their usage of magic, they can combine their powers to form an arcane hierarchy that allows them to support each others' abilities.

A hierarchy consists of at least two spell casters in service to the Tomb Kingdoms. Any of the creatures in this document can be members of a hierarchy. The Challenge Rating (CR) of members of a hierarchy should be increased by 1.

Members of a hierarchy gain the following benefits:

* Upon rolling initiative, members of a hierarchy can swap their initiative orders with each other in any order they agree upon.

* When a member of the hierarchy casts a spell requiring concentration, it can choose another willing member who isn't already concentrating on a spell to maintain concentration on the spell in its place. Moreover, if a member dies while concentrating on a spell, another member can choose to maintain concentration of the spell for its remaining duration.

* All members gain a +1 bonus to saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells for each hierarchy member within 60 feet.

### Liche Priest Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these undying lore keepers in your games:

##### Liche Priest Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The God-Pharaoh's Return:** The liche priests are working on a ritual to reincarnate a long-dead God-Pharaoh, a ruler so powerful that his reign would spell doom for the living world. The adventurers must find and destroy the artifacts that power this ritual.|
|  2  | **The Last Acolyte:** Rumors speak of a last living acolyte of a liche priest, carrying secrets that could either bolster the Tomb Kingdoms or bring about their final demise. Both protectors and hunters of this acolyte seek the party's assistance.|
|  3  |**Deserted Village:** A village near the Tomb Kingdoms has been mysteriously abandoned overnight. Tracks lead to an underground crypt where a liche priest is rumored to have been experimenting with new forms of magic. |
|  4  | **The Soul Harvest:** A liche priest has devised a dark ritual that drains the souls of the living to rejuvenate his desiccated form. Villages nearby are reporting their people falling into soulless comas. The adventurers must stop the ritual and confront the priest before an entire city becomes his next target. |
|  5  | **Keepers of the Forbidden Library**: An ancient library containing forbidden knowledge is protected by the liche priests. When an explorer manages to steal a tome and is subsequently cursed, the adventurers are hired to infiltrate the library, return the book, and break the curse.  |
|  6  | **The Stolen Sun:** A liche priest, envious of the living world, has captured a fragment of the sun, plunging the region into eternal night and cold. The adventurers must traverse the treacherous, darkened desert to reclaim the sun fragment and restore daylight.|

### Liche Priest Tactics
These powerful spellcasters specialize in enhancing their undead minions. They possess a range of spells, and different rankings of priests have different power levels.

Instead of detailing every rank of liche, these tactics focus on the spells they can access and how to use them most effectively. The more spells the liche has access to, the more urgently they should be cast, typically starting with the most potent. Liches can wisely identify party members with weak proficiencies and saving throws and use that to determine who to target with what spells.

#### Lore of Death 
Death liches prioritize dealing damage and will sacrifice minions to empower themselves. They reserve their stronger spells for later stages of combat when enemies are more likely to fail their saves, thanks to their Life Leech trait.

**Crippling Pain:** Target skirmishers like rogues or monks to hinder their combat effectiveness.

**Spirit Leech:** Use when a target with low Charisma is within range or when the liche's health drops below half.

**Impending Doom:** Target martial characters with multiple attacks and low Charisma.

**Horrifying Laughter or Wind of Death:**  Use *horrifying laughter* to target martial characters with low Wisdom scores. Switch to *wind of death* when its saving throw has been boosted by at least +1 or if it can affect four or more targets, as it synergizes well with the Life Leech trait.

**Aspect of Dread:** This is a strong opening spell, forcing multiple targets to make saving throws and fueling the liche's Life Leech trait. It can also be cast on an enemy to frighten its allies or serve as an escape tool when the liche is surrounded.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



#### Lore of Liche-Priests

Liches with this lore rely heavily on their minions for maximum potential, with at least three minions being essential for full efficiency.

**Guiding Wind:** This spell can be used to move a large group of undead into melee combat, or help ranged archers escape from combat. It can also serve as an escape for the liche if it's in melee combat. However, be cautious with the positioning of the spell; enemies within the spell's radius can opt to be moved by it as well.

**Incantation of Protection or Incantation of Zeal:** Prioritize *incantation of zeal* over *incantation of protection* unless enemies are using bludgeoning weapons against skeletons or over half the party consists of martial classes wielding weapons that deal physical damage. In such cases, prioritize *incantation of protection*.

**Black Tentacles or Decrepify:** Cast *black tentacles* when three or more targets are available, or if two targets engage with minions. Be wary; skeletons affected by this spell will incur double damage. If targets are dispersed, use *decrepify*—preferably a martial character with a weak Constitution saving throw.

**Skull Storm:** Use *skull storm* once it can affect three targets. If it can hit two targets, prioritize the spell's bonus action over the liche's Dredge ability. The liche might opt to move alongside the spell to shield itself from ranged attacks. The Liche will cease concentration on this spell if the initial storm has moved beyond outside the field of battle or if the spell's bonus action can't affect two or more targets.

\pagebreakNum

#### Lore of Light 
Light liches rely on grouping up their enemies and allies alike to maximize their potency.

**Warding Light:** Cast this as a bonus action when the liche's main action is occupied with something else, such as executing a Disengage maneuver.

**Burning Gaze:** This spell is ideal when it can hit four or more creatures, be they allies or adversaries. If foes are scattered, concentrate *burning gaze* on a single enemy to impose a disadvantage on its saving throw. 

**Dazzling Light & Sunbeam:** These spells are best used when they can affect four or more creatures, whether enemies or allies.

**Flame Strike & Net of Light Combo:** *Flame strike* becomes more lethal when combined with *net of light*. Initiate with *net of light* so that targets caught by it suffer disadvantage on their saves against *flame strike*. Abandon concentration on *net of light* once only two or fewer creatures are trapped within it, especially if the liche has an optimal opportunity to cast *sunbeam*.

#### Lore of Shadow
Shadow liches use debilitating and enhancing spells and utilize their Shadow Paths trait for optimal positioning.

**Shroud of Dusk:** Use this spell against adversaries in melee combat with the liche, then have the liche swap positions with a minion to distance itself from the threat.

**Unseen Lurker:** This should ideally be cast on the liche's most formidable martial minion, then used to swap places with the minion to position it advantageously.

**Withering Resolve:** Target the enemy with the weakest Wisdom save to cripple its capabilities.

**Penumbral Pendulum:** Activate when two or more targets with low Intelligence and Dexterity saves can be caught in its path. If three or more targets are available, cast it, even if they have high Intelligence and Dexterity saves.




\columnbreak

**Mindrazors or Pit of Shadows:** Which of these two spells the liche uses depends on whether it can target two or more enemies with *pit of shadows*, specifically those with low Dexterity saves. If this is not feasible, use *mindrazors*. Abandon concentration on *mindrazors* if an opportunity arises to use *pit of shadows* on two or more targets later.

#### Hieratic Hierarchy
When liches come together to form a hierarchy, they can execute devastating combos by pooling their concentration with junior members, enabling them to channel spells they wouldn't normally use together. Potential combinations are vast, but here are a few notable ones:

**Net of Light & Sunbeam:** This combination can wreak havoc. A hierarchy member capable of casting *net of light* should initiate the sequence, regardless of its power. This should then be followed by the most powerful liche using sunbeam on the trapped creatures.

**Decrepify, Black Tentacles & Skull Storms:** Use *decrepify* to nearly guarantee that targets fail their saving throws against the subsequent *black tentacles* and *skull storm*.

**Impending Doom with Other Casters:** *Impending doom* becomes particularly potent when combined with other spellcasters. Cast it quickly, as it enhances the potency of all the liches' magic, whose spells typically have a low baseline save DCs.

**Withering Resolve & Powerful Spells:** The potency of *withering resolve* is magnified when channeled by multiple casters. Let the more junior members of the hierarchy who can cast it take the lead. Then, the most formidable among them should follow up with a mighty spell such as *penumbral pendulum* or *pit of shadows*.

## Casket of Souls
In the sprawling necropolises of the Tomb Kingdoms, ancient secrets are kept hidden from the prying eyes of the world. Among the most fearsome of these enigmas are the Caskets of Souls. Nestled deep in the heart of the grandest tombs, these artifacts are not only a testament to the Tomb Kingdoms' arcane prowess but also a symbol of their unforgiving justice.

The appearance of a Casket of Souls is truly awe-inspiring. Carved from a single slab of onyx, the casket is adorned with hieroglyphs depicting scenes of eternal torment and divine judgment. On its lid rests golden effigies of vultures, representing the Tomb Kingdom god of the dead watching over the casket to ensure the souls within cannot escape.

Inside, the casket serves as a prison for the souls of those who dared defy or displease the mighty rulers and priests of the Tomb Kingdoms. Instead of granting them the honor of joining their ancestors in the afterlife, these unfortunate beings are condemned to an eternity of torment within the casket, their spirits never to find rest.

When the Tomb Kingdoms march to war, the casket doesn't remain behind. A dedicated liche attendant conjures forth the casket from its resting place to the battlefield. With practiced precision and dark incantations, the liche attendant can momentarily unlock the casket. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

As the lid creaks open, vengeful souls pour out like a tempestuous wind, hungry for release and retribution. Directed by the will of the attendant, these souls sweep through the enemy ranks, withering those they touch and tearing the very essence from their victims. Once their brief freedom ends, the attendant's incantations pull them back into their dark prison, along with the new souls they've claimed.

Such is the power emanating from the Casket of Souls that it distorts the very fabric of magic around it. Mages and sorcerers find their spells dissipating or going awry in the artifact's presence. However, with another whispered incantation, the liche attendant can twist this disruption, amplifying the magical prowess of their allies while still hindering their foes.

But woe betide those who believe they can simply destroy the casket and end its threat. If shattered, the built-up wrath and pain of millennia burst forth. Freed souls, in their final moments of liberation, lash out in a blinding frenzy, consuming everything in their path before dissipating into the ether, finally finding the peace denied to them for so long.

In the ever-shifting sands of time, many artifacts and relics are lost or forgotten. But the Caskets of Souls, and the dread they inspire, ensure that the dread power of the Tomb Kingdoms will never be overlooked or underestimated.

### Casket of Souls Mechanics

The casket of souls is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the casket if it has proficiency in the Religion skill and both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 14 or higher. 

A creature attuned to the casket can perform a minute-long ritual to summon it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat a casket of souls with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

#### Unleashing the Souls

The creature attuned to the casket of souls and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the tormented souls within, targeting a creature it can see within 300 feet. The souls can then jump to another creature within 15 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 15 feet of that one. A creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per turn. A targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If a creature fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) or if the damage from this ability reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the casket begins extracting the target's soul. This effect ends if the casket is destroyed. The affected creature repeats the saving throw at the start of the casket user's next turn, with disadvantage if it has 0 hit points. On a success, the effect ends. If the creature fails, it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the casket until the casket is destroyed. While a creature's soul is trapped this way, it can't be resurrected.

#### Arcane Conduit

Additionally, creatures within 150 feet of the casket have a -1 penalty to their spell save DC and spell attack rolls. The creature attuned to the casket can choose for a creature to receive a +1 bonus instead. This modifier remains even if the creature attuned to the casket dies.

#### The Casket's Destruction

If the casket of souls is destroyed, the trapped souls are freed and lash out at all nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the casket must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Casket of Souls Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from liche priests come in the form of relics and religious icons they carry.

## The Grand Hierophant

In the dim mists of antiquity, when the Tomb Kingdoms still brimmed with life, there arose a sage of unparalleled prowess, known today as the Grand Hierophant. As time withered ancient stones, his name grew synonymous with the enigmatic might of the Tomb Kingdoms.

The Grand Hierophant was the pioneering beacon amongst the liche priests, the first to decipher the esoteric rites of eternal existence, transcending mortality to ascend into undeath. His physique is a haunting mirage of his former self; a desiccated skeletal form draped in opulent, tattered robes, symbolic of his age and wisdom. An ornate staff, crowned with a shimmering gem, proclaims his exalted station. His eye sockets, though devoid of life, glint with an eerie, otherworldly glow, hinting at the vast knowledge and power trapped within.

However, power often invites hubris. With the fall of the Tomb Kingdoms and their subsequent resurrection, the inability of the liche priests to fully restore their once grand civilization was seen as a grievous failure. The Grand Hierophant, as the paragon of their order, bore the brunt of this blame. Thus, a great irony befell him: the one who had unlocked the secrets of immortality was exiled from the very lands he had once elevated. Sworn to wander the vastness beyond the Tomb Kingdoms, he seeks the elusive remedy that would restore his homeland to its prior living magnificence. Until that day, the deserts are forbidden to him.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Yet exile did not diminish him; if anything, it has given him countless opportunities to expand upon his archaic knowledge and power. As eons passed, the Grand Hierophant has amassed an unmatched reservoir of arcane secrets. He wields not only a repertoire of ancient spells but does so with a mastery far beyond any of his liche priest subordinates. Those who try to combat his magic with their own will quickly be cursed and unable to cast spells as their mouths fill with vile insects. Should the gods choose to favor him, the Grand Hierophant can even surround himself in an obscuring and biting sandstorm, making conventional combat tactics difficult to use against him as well.


The Grand Hierophant is formidable enough on his own, but his true power lies in his command over the legions of the dead. Undead guardians rally to his side, driven by an unwavering loyalty. These minions, guided by his ancient hand, are imbued with enhanced vigor, making them formidable adversaries. While they engage, The Grand Hierophant hurls curses upon his enemies, weakening their resolve and corroding their vitality. 

Many have stood against The Grand Hierophant, and he has outlasted them all. Any who stand in the way of his sacred quest will be cast into the oblivion he has evaded for millennia. And once he has found the secrets he seeks, he will return to his dead, crumbling home and restore it to its former, indomitable heights of power.

>
> ***Scroll of the Cursing Word (1/day).*** As a bonus action or as a reaction to The Grand Hierophant seeing a spell being cast with a verbal component, The Grand Hierophant curses each creature of its choice within 300 feet of it for 10 minutes. While cursed, when a creature casts a spell with a verbal component, it must make a DC 15 ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a success, the curse ends for that creature. On a failed save, it takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage per level of the spell. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 5), the spell has no effect and is wasted as its mouth is filled with sand and dung beetles.
>
> ***Staff of The Grand Hierophant.*** When The Grand Hierophant casts a spell that requires concentration while holding this staff, he can have a willing creature within 60 feet of him also concentrate on the spell. The spell does not end if The Grand Hierophant loses concentration as long as the other creature is still concentrating on the spell. The other creature loses concentration if it is 60 or more feet away from The Grand Hierophant, is out of line of sight from The Grand Hierophant, or The Grand Hierophant concentrates on another spell.
>
> ### Bonus Action

> **Check.** The Grand Hierophant makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Drag Down.** A creature that just took its turn and is restrained by The Grand Hierophant's *black tentacles* spell must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.

> **Incantation (Cost 2 Actions).** The Grand Hierophant casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

\pagebreakNum

### Optional Ability: <br> Wrath of the Desert

The Grand Hierophant is protected by the gods of the desert, who can project their power at his behest. If you give him this ability, increase his CR by 1.     
 
 **Sand Storm (Recharges on a short rest).**
At the start of the round on Initiative count 20, The Grand Hierophant can create a 100-foot tall sandstorm with a 20-foot radius centered at a point within 120 feet of him. This ability can be activated even if The Grand Hierophant is incapacitated or surprised. The storm spreads around corners and lasts for 10 minutes, or until it is dismissed by The Grand Hierophant (no action required) or he dies.

The area within the storm is considered difficult terrain and is heavily obscured for creatures other than The Grand Hierophant. Additionally, ranged weapon attack rolls are made with disadvantage if their path passes through the storm.

On initiative count 20 of subsequent rounds, The Grand Hierophant can move the storm up to 20 feet in any direction. If the storm moves over a creature or if a creature ends its turn within the storm, that creature must make a Strength saving throw (The Grand Hierophant ignores this effect). On a failed save, the creature takes 6d6 slashing damage, is pulled 10 feet toward the storm's center, and if the creature is concentrating on a spell, it makes its concentration saving throw caused by the damage with disadvantage.
 


### Casket of Souls
  
The Grand Hierophant can be attuned to a Casket of Souls (whose mechanics are described below.) While attuned, he gains the following special abilities and is considered a CR 20 creature:
  
* He is immune to damage and cannot be moved or teleported against his will while within 5 feet of the casket.
  
* He can unleash the casket's souls (as described in the casket mechanics below) using a legendary action. The initial target for the souls must be the creature that just took its turn.
  
* He can use a legendary action to teleport the casket and himself to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the casket.

### Casket of Souls Mechanics

The casket of souls is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the casket if it has proficiency in the Religion skill and both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 14 or higher. 

A creature attuned to the casket can perform a minute-long ritual to summon it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat a casket of souls with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

\columnbreak

#### Unleashing the Souls

The creature attuned to the casket of souls and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the tormented souls within, targeting a creature it can see within 300 feet. The souls can then jump to another creature within 15 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 15 feet of that one. A creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per turn. A targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If a creature fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) or if the damage from this ability reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the casket begins extracting the target's soul. This effect ends if the casket is destroyed. The affected creature repeats the saving throw at the start of the casket user's next turn, with disadvantage if it has 0 hit points. On a success, the effect ends. If the creature fails, it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the casket until the casket is destroyed. While a creature's soul is trapped this way, it can't be resurrected.

#### Arcane Conduit

Additionally, creatures within 150 feet of the casket have a -1 penalty to their spell save DC and spell attack rolls. The creature attuned to the casket can choose for a creature to receive a +1 bonus instead. This modifier remains even if the creature attuned to the casket dies.

#### The Casket's Destruction

If the casket of souls is destroyed, the trapped souls are freed and lash out at all nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the casket must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
##### The Grand Hierophant Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Lost Manuscript:** Whispers circulate of a manuscript detailing the secrets of The Grand Hierophant's power. Many treasure hunters and arcanists are on its trail. The adventurers are hired to retrieve it but must face traps, rival seekers, and perhaps even the watchful eyes of The Hierophant himself.|
|  2  |**The Cursed Oasis:** A cursed oasis has appeared in the desert, with water that turns living beings into stone. Rumors suggest it's The Grand Hierophant's latest experiment in restoring life to the Tomb Kingdoms. The adventurers must investigate and find a way to reverse the curse.|
|  3  |**The Hierophant's Bargain:** An emissary of The Grand Hierophant approaches the party with a deal. Aid him in retrieving an ancient tome, and in return, they'll be granted a boon of power or knowledge. But can they trust the legendary liche priest? |
|  4  | **The Mirage Fortress:** A fortress appears and disappears within the desert at different times. It's believed The Grand Hierophant uses it as a base for his studies. The adventurers, for their reasons or by hiring, are tasked to infiltrate it and uncover its secrets.| 
 
\pagebreakNum

### The Grand Hierophant Tactics 
The Grand Hierophant represents the pinnacle of liche priest spellcasters. Always accompanied by a minimum of three elite undead warriors, The Grand Hierophant is a tactician who prioritizes his own safety over dealing direct damage. His potent ability to heal and resurrect his fallen soldiers makes him excel in prolonged engagements, often outlasting his enemies.

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word 
This ability is triggered in reaction to spellcasting threats. If any spellcaster manages to negate the curse, they immediately become the primary target for The Grand Hierophant and his minions.

#### The Grand Hierophant's Staff 
The Grand Hierophant strategically shares his concentration with the healthiest minion, ensuring it is not already paralyzed or vulnerable to incoming attacks. Furthermore, The Grand Hierophant can use the staff to concentrate on a variety of spells, each unlocking unique legendary actions. Below is a prioritized list detailing which spells he should cast first to harness their associated legendary actions.

##### Skull Storm
On its initial turn, The Grand Hierophant casts *skull storm*, targeting two or more enemies. After this, he deploys his Gust of Skulls legendary action whenever he can affect two or more targets again.

##### Black Tentacles
If The Grand Hierophant identifies two or more targets with low Dexterity and *skull storm* is no longer available, he will cast *black tentacles*. Once enemies are restrained, he will use his Drag Down legendary action. However, he avoids using this action on players with a high Strength saving throw, like barbarians.

##### Decrepify
This spell is reserved for scenarios where neither allies nor enemies are closely grouped for The Grand Hierophant's Incantation spells. The ideal targets are martial characters with weak Constitution saving throws. Once cast, he will use his Wither legendary action at the earliest opportunity.

\columnbreak

#### Incantation
The Grand Hierophant should cast spells using his Incantation legendary action when he can affect three or more powerful allies, particularly undead with a CR (Challenge Rating) of 3 or higher. However, these spells are of secondary priority if he can target three or more enemies with *black tentacles* or *skull storm*.

##### Specific Incantations and Their Uses:

**Guiding Wind:** 
* This spell should be deployed to swiftly move a large group of undead into melee combat.

* It is useful for allowing ranged archers to disengage from close combat.

* It acts as a potential escape route for The Grand Hierophant when surrounded. 

* Caution is advised, as adversaries within the spell's radius might also choose to be moved by it.

#####
**Incantation of Zeal vs. Incantation of Protection:**

* *Incantation of zeal* should generally be given priority over *incantation of protection*.

* However, if opponents possess bludgeoning weapons and The Grand Hierophant has skeletons under his command, or if a significant portion of the enemy group consists of martial classes using physical weaponry, then *incantation of protection* should be prioritized.

#### Tomb Strike Legendary Action
This action is used when The Grand Hierophant doesn't have a group of allies to enhance or isn't currently concentrating on a spell.

#### Wrath of the Desert
The Grand Hierophant summons this storm at the start of the fight and positions it to impact the highest number of targets. If players scatter, he directs the storm toward ranged attackers, aiming to disable their attack options.

#### Casket of Souls
When The Grand Hierophant uses the casket of souls, his strategy shifts. While he will still cast *skull storm* on his initial turn, all subsequent legendary actions will be devoted to utilizing the power of the casket.
