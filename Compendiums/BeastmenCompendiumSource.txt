# Beastmen Compendium

In the shadowed depths of ancient forests, where sunlight scarcely penetrates the dense canopy, the beastmen gather as they prepare to make war on all of civilization. These vile humanoids are a grotesque blend of horned beast and man, embodying the primal savagery of the animal kingdom and the cunning malevolence of humanity. Their twisted forms are a mockery of the human shape, with gnarled horns, coarse fur, and bestial visages that inspire fear and revulsion.

The beastmen harbor a deep-seated loathing for civilization and its creations. They view the structured order of cities and towns as an affront to their wild and chaotic nature, and they take perverse pleasure in despoiling the works of more civilized races. This hatred is not just ideological but deeply instinctual, driving them to relentless acts of destruction and desecration.

Their abode is the untamed wilderness of the dark forests, a labyrinthine world of shadows and danger. The beastmen are not alone in these murky realms; they often form temporary alliances with other destructive monsters and malevolent entities that share their disdain for order and harmony. These dark alliances make the heart of the forests a place of nightmares, where few dare to tread.

\columnbreak

The society of the beastmen is characterized by rowdiness, impulsiveness, and a lack of any refined culture. They live for the thrill of the hunt, the joy of battle, and the ecstasy of indulgence in their base desires. Their communities are driven by a brutal hierarchy where strength and savagery are the only currencies of respect. Hedonism and bloodlust are not just common but celebrated, and their rituals and revels are debauched affairs that often end in violence or worse.

Despite their apparent lack of sophistication, the beastmen are not to be underestimated. They possess cunning and knowledge of their woodland domains, making them formidable adversaries. Their raids are swift and brutal, striking like a tempest and leaving behind only ruin and despair. In the savage wilds, the beastmen reign supreme, a constant reminder of the dark and wild forces that lurk just beyond the boundaries of the civilized world.

This document provides content to help you run games that heavily feature the beastmen or any of the savage creatures that dwell in their forest domain. This content ranges from new spells used by the beastmen to a bestiary of the different types of beastmen and the monsters they utilize. Whether the players only have a minor side quest featuring beastmen or an entire campaign, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

# Running Beastmen Adventures 

The setting you're running your adventures in will help determine the origin of the beastmen and how they fit into your world. They may be irredeemably evil monsters who serve dark gods and seek the downfall of civilization. They may have once been rowdy, uncouth humans who succumbed to their wild impulses and were cursed with bestial forms. Or, they may be a savage but misunderstood race of forest dwellers the players are able to reason with.

Regardless of their origins, there are some common traits that define the beastmen and the creatures they ally with:

* **Driven By Base Urges:** All humans experience primal drives that push them towards violence or hedonism and must be controlled through discipline and civility. Beastmen lack and actively despise such forces of restraint and wholly give themselves to their debauched urges. They are wild and undisciplined in combat and prone to extreme and destructive revelry whenever given the chance. This makes them aggressive and unpredictable enemies but also limits their ability to organize and build anything of value.

* **Loathing of Civilization:** Beastmen lack the ability to create any civilization's marvelous works, and in turn, they hate all such creations. The creations of civilization allow softer, weaker humanoids to hold them at bay, and as such, beastmen seek to tear down civilization in all its forms so the playing field can be tipped in their favor. While beastmen will readily plunder the works of civilization for their own use, they will never put any effort into maintaining anything they've taken.

* **Might Makes Right:** Beastmen society is as uncivilized as one could imagine, and status within their clans is generally determined by strength and intimidation (though some cunning beastmen can rise in power through other means). The leaders of beastmen control their forces using such means and must always be ready to put down challengers while trying to maintain some form of cohesion among their wild and rowdy kin.

\columnbreak

### Beastmen Motivations
Most beastmen have simple motivations driven by base impulses that rarely stretch far into the future. They seek to gratify their animalistic urges which tend to include violence and destruction. They also seek to rise in status among their clan whenever possible, asserting dominance over others whenever the opportunity presents itself.

Leaders among the beastmen may have longer-term goals that involve bringing about the downfall of towns, cities, or even whole kingdoms. They find ways to tactically channel the destructive capabilities of their tribe to maximum effect, allowing them to pursue larger and grander acts of destruction.

When role-playing beastmen, don't overthink them. They are usually at the mercy of their destructive impulses and will pursue whatever is most likely to bring them immediate gratification. However, they are not mindless, and many still possess a low cunning, allowing them to plot ways to achieve their goals. They also possess a strong sense of self-preservation, which is often at odds with their impulsive nature. Beastmen can very quickly flip from wild abandon to panicked cowardess.

#### Common Beastmen Motivations
* Destroy Edifice of Civilization (Town, City, Caravan, Etc.)
* Indulge in Violence or Hedonism
* Gain Status in Clan
* Exact Vengeance on Enemy
* Appease Primal Gods
* Secure Forest Territory

### Tactics of the Beastmen Forces
The combat tactics used by the different types of beastmen are described along with each individual creature's description later in this document. When beastmen forces come together to form large war herds, they are able to operate with a level of coordination that belies their savage and impulsive nature. Though they aren't known for their intelligence, beastmen can employ tactics that resemble a cross between those used by a pack of predatory beasts and a gang of malicious bullies. They can work together to bring down powerful targets but get malicious glee when mobbing vulnerable victims.

Beastmen prefer rapid surprise attacks, relying on wild, savage, bravado, and bloodlust to immediately put their foes on the back foot. So long as they are pressing their advantage, the beastmen can rely on savage aggression to compensate for their lack of organization. However, if the tables turn on them, the craven and undisciplined nature of the beastmen causes their fighting force to quickly begin losing cohesion as tactics fall apart and many begin to flee. Only a beastman force led by a powerful leader can maintain its integrity in the face of such adversity.

# New Spells

## Lore of Beasts
This brand of magic draws on the power of the wilds and the animals that inhabit them. Those who practice it avoid civilization and live hermitic lives in the savage and untamed wilderness. Their magic harnesses the power of the beasts they dwell alongside, often by summoning wild spirits or unleashing the inner savagery of themselves and others to transform them into primeval creatures. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Beasts often wield.

#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

<br><br>


#### Aspect of the Beast

*4th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

#### Bestial Spirit

*4th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.


<br>

#### Call of the Pack

*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Ranger
___

Unleashing a primal howl, you stir the wild fervor within your allies. You and up to three other creatures you are aware of within range that can hear you are quickened* until the start of your next turn. While quickened this way, these creatures gain advantage on attack rolls against any enemy if at least one of their allies is within 5 feet of that enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**New condition described above*

#### Impenetrable Pelt

*5th-level  transmutation*
___

#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

## Lore of Death

This brand of magic plays on the nature of mortality and fragility of life, though it is strictly distinct from traditional necromancy, as it embraces the inevitability of death rather than attempting to deny it. Its users can manipulate negative energy, sap the vitality of foes, and instill mortal terror in those around them. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Death often wield.

#### Aspect of Dread

- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard 
___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Crippling Pain
*3rd-level necromancy*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric Warlock, Wizard

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Wizard
___

You target a creature you can see within range, causing it to collapse into debilitating fits of deranged laughter. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less aren't affected.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration, any creature within 30 feet of the laughing creature that can hear the laughter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the laughing creature until the end of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it stabilizes but remains laughing and can no longer attempt saving throws against the spell. If the spell ends while the creature has 0 hit points, it dies.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

On a failed save, the creature is petrified for the duration. At the end of <br> each of its turns, the target can make another <br> Constitution saving throw. On a success, the <br> spell ends on the target. However, if a creature <br> accumulates three failed saves against this <br> spell (including the initial failed save), it <br> remains petrified indefinitely until the <br> condition is cured by other means.

If a petrified creature is physically <br> damaged or broken during this state, it <br> will manifest the same damage upon <br> being reverted to its original form.

> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone.

Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

You release a surge of chilling shadows in a 15-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 1d10 cold damage, and on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

\columnbreak

The the line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

## Lore of The Wild
This magic taps into the savage and primeval <br> aspects of nature that have plagued humanity <br> since the dawn of time. Some of these spells <br> conjure the most monstrous aspects of the wild, <br> while others undo the thin veneer of civility that <br> separates humans and their "domestic" creatures <br> from barbaric savagery. This magic is often wielded <br> by those who wish to undo civilization and return <br> everything to a  state of primitive barbarism. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore <br> of The Wild often wield.


#### Devolve
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of lizard brain)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Druid, Sorcerer

You choose a creature you can see within range. It must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be overwhelmed by the primal aspects of its psyche for the duration of the spell. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. 

While affected, the creature:
* Has disadvantage on Intelligence and Charisma checks
* Cannot cast or concentrate on spells
* Cannot activate magic items
* Cannot speak or understand any language
* Is treated as a beast with an Intelligence score of 4 when targeted by spells and abilities that normally only target beasts, such as *dominate beast* or *beast bond* (This doesn't change its actual Intelligence score)

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, the affected creature takes 1d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns while under this spell's effects before it makes the saving throw. When cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Mad Rampage

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a stinger)
- **Duration:**  1 minute
- **Classes:**   Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You plunge a willing creature within range that you can see into a frenzied state, making it reckless and heedless of danger. 

For the duration of the spell:
* The creature incurs a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature becomes quickened.
* When the creature hits with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, it deals an additional die of its damage. If the creature moves at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making the attack, the attack deals two additional dice of its damage, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

If the creature is charmed or frightened, these effects are suspended for the duration of this spell.

#### Mystic Signal

*5th-level transmutation (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** self
- **Components:**  V, S, M (A focus worth at <br> least 500 gp, such as a war horn, marble <br> bird, or a gem encrusted jaw bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
___

This spell enables you to broadcast a brief message, no longer than four seconds in length, to each creature within 3 miles of your location. Recipients of the message hear it in their minds and, if they know you, recognize you as the sender. Additionally, they discern your distance and direction at the time of casting. The spell ensures that creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 1 can comprehend the message's meaning. 

A sleeping creature can hear the message and may choose to awaken upon hearing it.

You can tailor the spell to target specific types of creatures only, such as humans, giants, unicorns, etc.

The message cannot be received by any creature if there is any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocking a direct path between you and the creature.

#### Primal Scream
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A goat hair)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Bard
___

You or a willing creature of your choice within range is filled with primal vigor and releases a powerful howling roar in a 30-foot cone. If the target is prone, it can immediately stand up without using any movement. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

Additionally, the creature releasing the roar regains 3d8 hit points. Constructs and undead cannot regain hit points from this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the damage and healing increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Savage Dominion

*7th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Warlock
___

You call forth a formidable creature of your choice: a **Stone Hurling Giant**, a **Madding Jabberwocky**, or a **Hungering Behemoth**. It materializes in an unoccupied space within range and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

This primitive creature is allied with you and your companions. It acts on your initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. You can telepathically communicate with the creature while you are on the same plane, and you are both aware of each other's locations. It follows your telepathic commands without requiring an action from you. If not given any commands, it automatically moves toward and attacks the nearest creature it detects.

If the creature moves more than 100 feet from you, your concentration on the spell is broken. Additionally, at the start of its turn, if the creature has taken damage since its last turn, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn't disappear but becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and you lose control over it. The uncontrolled creature cannot be dismissed by you and will disappear 1 hour after it was summoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the summoned creature gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 7th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, the spell's duration extends to 8 hours.

#### Traitor-Kin

*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a stinger)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You choose a beast, monstrosity, giant, dragon, or fey within range that can see and hear you with an Intelligence score of 7 or lower and instill it with a surge of betrayal, compelling it to attack its allies. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you until the end of your next turn. 

While charmed this way, all attack rolls against it have advantage, it cannot take reactions or bonus actions, and on the creature's next turn, you may dictate another creature for it to attack (no action required). On its turn, the charmed creature must move towards the chosen target by the safest route possible if it is aware of where the chosen creature is, and it must use its Attack action to make all its attacks against the target, which are made with advantage. If it is unaware of the chosen creature's location, it does nothing on its turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Vile Tide
*2nd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M  (A few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
___

You cause a swarm of insects to erupt from the ground within a 10-foot square area at a point you choose within range. Each creature standing in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 piercing damage, and insects burrow into the creature, remaining there for the spell's duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage, and the insects do not burrow into it. 

While the insects are burrowed in a creature, the creature has disadvantage on checks, cannot regain hit points, and takes 2d4 piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. 

Any creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the insects from a creature. This check must be done using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, and it causes 1d4 damage of its damage type to the target. On a successful check, all the insects are destroyed, and the spell ends for that creature. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the insects, but if it does, the target takes 3d4 damage instead. 

Alternatively, a creature can expend a use of a Healer's Kit or use the *lesser restoration* spell to purge the insects without needing to make a check.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Beastman Magic Items
Most beastmen don't take part in crafting anything beyond the crudest weaponry as they are more inclined towards destruction than creation. However, they often acquire powerful magical items by twisting the creations of others or finding dark sources of power in the wild that can be formed into imposing weapons. The following magic items reflect some of the creations that can be found in their possession.


### Axe of Man-Slaying 
*Weapon (Greataxe), Uncommon (Requires Attunement), 1,000 gp*  

*The Axe of Man-Slaying earned its name for its ability to cleave even the largest warrior in twain as easily as a hot knife cuts through butter. This fearsome weapon slices with terrifying ease, its effortless carving through the strongest foes a stupefying—and horrifying—sight that emboldens allies while breaking enemies.*

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 20 slashing damage. If a creature has 20 Hit Points or fewer after taking this damage, it is cut in half and dies. If a creature dies this way, each enemy in a 60-foot emanation from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for the next minute. A frightened creature takes the Dash action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on that creature. Additionally, each ally in the emanation may end any frightened condition affecting them.


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


### The Black Star

*Weapon (Morningstar), Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 16,000 gp*

*The cudgel was forged from the remnants of a meteorite that crashed down from the heavens, unleashing a wave of madness upon impact. Those who take up this hulking weapon find its spirit granting them visions of mayhem and slaughter—causing the wielder’s mind to drown in insanity.*

When you roll Initiative while holding this weapon, you can choose to have the weapon gain up to three charges until the end of combat. The weapon gets +1 to attack rolls and deals an additional 1d8 dice of damage for each charge it has. Additionally, at the start of each of your turns, even if you are not holding the weapon, you roll a number of d6s on the Madness Effects Table (found at the end of the document) equal to the number of charges on the weapon to determine your actions during the turn.


### Horn of the First Beast

*Wonderous Item (Instrument), Rare (Requires Attunement), 12,800 gp*

*This fossilized horn belonged to the first beast birthed from the twisting power of Chaos, when its corruption first took hold in the mortal realm. When blown, it releases an ancient roar that fills those who hear it with primeval fury.*

As an action, you can blow this horn, causing each ally within 60 feet to become Emboldened*. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until the next dawn. When the horn is sounded, it can be heard clearly up to a mile away.

**New condition described at the end of the section*

### Horn of the Great Hunt

*Wonderous Item (Instrument), Very Rare <Br> (Requires Attunement), 60,000 gp*

*Said to have been fashioned from the tusk of a dead boar god, this horn has been used by beastmen for generations in their foul conquests. When sounded, the entire warband surges forward with predatory fervor.*

When you roll Initiative and are not incapacitated or surprised while holding the horn, you may blow it. If you do, any number of allies within 120 feet of you that can hear the horn, and are not surprised or incapacitated, also roll Initiative and gain a +5 bonus to their roll. Their speed then increases by 20 feet for their first turn in combat. When the horn is sounded, it can be heard clearly up to a mile away.


### Hunting Spear

*Weapon (Spear), Rare (Requires Attunement), 4,800 gp*

*This thick-shafted hunting spear was crafted to fell the mighty beasts of the frozen wastes. The enchantments infused within it surge with power when the weapon is hurled, increasing its velocity and impact force.*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, attacking at long range with this weapon doesn’t impose disadvantage on the attack rolls, and the weapon deals an extra 2d6 piercing damage on hit if the attack was made at long range.


### Mind Mangler

*Weapon (Scimitar), Rare (Requires Attunement), 4,000 gp*

*Said to have once been a sentient weapon, its mind was shattered when its master attempted to use it to slay the hideous jabbersnarl brood mother of the ancient wood. The broken remnants of the blade’s consciousness—and twisted reflections of the revolting abomination—are still woven into its metal. Any struck by it have their minds assaulted by demented thoughts and maddening visions.*

At the end of your turn, you may choose one creature you hit with this weapon on this turn and force it to make a DC 15 *Intelligence Saving Throw*. <Br> *Failure:* The creature can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a number of d4s on the Madness Effects Table below equal to the number of times it was hit with the weapon this turn.

### Primeval Club

*Weapon (Club), Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 18,000 gp*

*This simple branch, wrapped in crude skins, is said to be a weapon fashioned in the distant past by the first tribes of humans who inhabited the deepest woods—long before villages and cities dotted the landscape. Those of truly feral nature are able to wield this club, delivering savage blows with primal force.*

While you aren’t wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon, and when you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d4 bludgeoning damage. In addition, you can use your Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using this weapon.

### Ram Horn Helm
*Wonderous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement), 4,000 gp*

*The helm was fashioned from a pair of thick, coiling horns taken from a particularly dreadful beastlord, slain by a rival who wished to add the impressive horns to his own regalia. The wearer of this mantle is able to charge into enemy lines with bone-cracking force.*

While wearing this helm, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Additionally, once per turn, if you move 20+ feet straight toward a target before hitting it with a melee weapon attack, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Rod of the Chattering Skull

*Rod, Uncommon (Requires Attunement),  1,000 gp*

*Once, a mighty bray-speaker tenaciously sought to master the dark arts to a degree no other disciple of Chaos ever had. So merciless was his pursuit of this twisted desire that he spiraled into lunacy. Ultimately, the shaman became so unhinged that his own tribe was forced to decapitate him. Now, the bray-speaker’s bleached skull is fastened to a crude rod, its jaws chattering as it imparts the maddening knowledge it gathered in life.*

The rod has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 of its expended charges daily at dawn.

When you or a willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you that can see and hear you fails a saving throw while you're holding the rod, you can use your reaction to expend a charge to roll up to 3d6 and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. On the creature's next turn, the creature performs the action on the Madness Effects Table (found at the end of the document) equal to the number added to the saving throw.

### Sacrificial Dagger

*Weapon (Dagger, Holy Symbol, Arcane Focus, Druidic Focus), Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 10,000 gp*

*A rough-hewn blade, stained with the blood of thousands of sacrifices. Any who add to the countless lives it has claimed will be greatly rewarded.*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, when you deal damage to a creature with a CR or class level of 1 or higher with this weapon, if it has 15 Hit Points or fewer after taking the damage, it dies and the blade gains a charge. The dagger can hold up to 5 charges.

While holding the dagger, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *aspect of dread* (2 charges), *crippling pain* (4 charges), *wind of death* (5 charges).

**New spell described in Spells section*

### Shredder Claws

*Weapon (Sickle), Rare (Requires Attunement), 5,000 gp*

*Many elegant elven swords were shattered to create this set of vicious claws, each blade pilfered from the mangled corpse of a mighty elven warrior and transmuted into one of the wicked fingers of this deadly apparatus. The claws can tear through anything they are set against, limited only by the fury of their wielder.*

The weapon comes in a pair, which the creature must have both of to attune to and counts as one attunement.

When you roll the weapon’s damage dice for an attack you make with either weapon, for each 4 you roll, the weapons deal an additional 1d8 damage on any further attacks you make this turn with either one. Additionally, when you score a critical hit with either weapon, instead of rolling all of your damage dice twice and adding them together, you treat the d4 roll as a 4.

### Staff of Swarming Insects (Revised)

*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 16,000 gp*

*The staff teems with all manner of invertebrates that endlessly scuttle up and down its surface, waiting to be unleashed at the command of its bearer.*

This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *fog cloud* (1 charge, the cloud appears as a swarm of insects), *vile tide** (2 charges), *giant insect* (4 charges), or *insect plague* (5 charges).

# The Warherd
This section lists the different <br> types of beastmen along with <br> the savage monsters they <br> often utilize in battle. The <br> different types of beastmen <br> include the shorthorns, <br> longhorns, and besthorns. The <br> various horrific monsters they utilize can be <br> found living alongside the beastmen or lurking <br> the wilds of their dark forest homelands. 

## Chaos Mutations

The twisting power of Chaos carries an unpredictable <br> quality in its corruption, bestowing a wide range of <br> deadly traits upon individuals. In places where Chaos <br> has deeply seeped into the land, there are records of monsters unlike anything seen elsewhere in the <br> world—wolf-like creatures with jagged beaks whose <br> saliva can dissolve metal; massive predatory cats that <br> melt into shadows and scale the sheer stone walls of fortresses to feed on inhabitants within; and even strange, wicked humanoids with hides thicker than leather, constantly shifting and warping to ward off attack. Accounts of these bizarre deviations and their horrific exploits are numerous. Yet no two records ever share a description of the exact same miscreation.

The following mechanics provide various mutations you can apply to existing creatures to represent the warping effect Chaos (or any other power appropriate to your setting) has had on that creature. This can provide surprise twists on creatures players are familiar with that challenge them in new ways and meaningfully display the power of Chaos to distort everything it touches.

**CR Increase.** Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

**Mutation Save DC.** If a mutation force a creature to make a Saving throw or check, the DC is equal to 10 + it's Proficiency Bonus

### General Mutations
The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any creature to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them. The creature receiving the mutation is referred to as the "mutant."

To pick a mutation at random, roll 1d20 and match the result to the number of the mutation.

#### 1. Acidic Secretions

*The beast’s claws, teeth, or other natural weapons drip with corrosive fluids, capable of reducing a victim to a delectable slurry should the caustic substance make contact.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Once per turn when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) acid damage and the creature is covered in acid until it or a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. While covered in acid, it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the end of each of its turns.


#### 2. Adaptive Defense

*Should one manage to wound the beast, its body begins to twist and change. Within seconds, it adapts into a new form impervious to the attacker’s strikes.*

The mutant gains the following Reaction:

***Adaptive Defense (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** *Trigger:* When the mutant takes damage. *Response:* The mutant becomes immune to the triggering damage type for the next minute. (This does not negate the damage that triggered the reaction.)


#### 3. Earth-Ripping Claws

*With massive paws or chitinous blades, the beast moves through the earth like a fish through water. Lurking below, it waits for the telltale vibrations of prey above before it strikes.*

The mutant has a burrow speed of 20 feet and Tremorsense out to 30 feet.


#### 4. Expeditious Metabolism

*The creature can digest blood, flesh, and bone within seconds, rapidly converting the carnage into fuel to restore its own body.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, it regains 20 hit points.

#### 5. Gnarled Hide

*The beast's hide has toughened up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The mutant gets +3 to its AC


#### 6. Gouging Tusks

*The beast has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn, if the mutant has moved 20+ feet straight toward a target immediately before it hits with the enhanced weapon, the target takes an extra 17 (5d6) piercing damage.


#### 7. Many Limbed Monster

*The beast sports an extra pair of limbs to tear at its enemies.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons.

When the mutant takes the Attack action, it makes one additional attack as part of the action, which uses the attack modifier of the chosen weapon for the attack roll. On hit, the target takes 14 (4d6) slashing damage.


#### 8. Regeneration

*No amount of slicing, stabbing, or thrashing will keep it down for long. Muscles regrow, skin stitches itself closed, bones snap back into place—and the beast rises once more.*

The mutant regains 15 hit points at the start of its turn. If the mutant takes fire or acid damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the mutant's next turn. The mutant dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

> ##### Using Mutations To Create Urgency In Adventures
> If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with beastmen and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the beastmen in the adventure gain mutations as time passes. This means the more slowly and carefully the players progress, the more dangerous the beastmen will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. 
> 
> If you want the mutations to be random, you can roll a d8 to determine what mutation they will gain (number each of the abilities in alphabetical order).
>
> The rate at which they gain mutations could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.
>
<br>

#### 9. Infesting Injector

*The beast can implant parasitic organisms into other creatures—whether they are grotesque organisms it harbors or its own repulsive young.*

Once per turn, when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, parasites burrow into target's flesh, infesting it. While infested, the creature takes 10 (3d6) damage. Any creature within reach can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check to remove the parasites using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, causing 1d6 damage of the same type to the target. On a successful check, the effect ends. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the parasites, but if it does, the target takes 2d6 damage instead.


#### 10. Shadow Hide

*The beast's black fur melds perfectly with the darkness around it, allowing it to stalk its prey from the shadows while completely unseen.*

While in darkness, the mutant is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness. Additionally, it gets a +5 on Dexterity (Stealth) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on checks from wearing armor.

#### 11. Shredding Implement

*The beast’s claws, beak, horns, or other natural weapons grow jagged and barbed, tearing muscles into tattered, useless strands.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn, when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, the target suffers a rending wound. While wounded, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution d20 Tests, and its speed is halved. The wound ends if the target regains 15 or more hit points at once or if the target, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to stanch the wound by succeeding on a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check.


#### 12. Slug-Skin

*This beastman's disgusting skin oozes thick, slippery, toxic slime.*

At the end of the mutant's turn, any ground within 5 feet of it is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain.

A creature standing on the slime has disadvantage on Dexterity and Strength saving throws, and prone creatures in the area must spend all their movement to stand up instead of half. If a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. Any creature with this mutation ignores its effects.

\columnbreak

#### 13. Snatching Appendage

*Whether a chameleon-like tongue, mantis-like limbs, or a grotesquely elongated arm, the beast can strike with lightning speed and drag its ill-gotten prize away—screaming.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

The enhanced weapon has its reach extended by 15 feet. On hit, the target is grappled and pulled 15 feet towards the creature.


#### 14. Sneak Attack

*Driven by malevolent cunning, the beast exploits even the most minuscule of gaps in its opponents' defenses, striking with terrifying precision.*

Once per turn, the mutant deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 feet of an ally of the mutant that isn't incapacitated and the mutant doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.


#### 15. Splendid Mantle

*This beast is adorned with especially grandiose features—twisting horns, vibrant feathered plumes, or some other majestic trait. Granting it an arrogant confidence, fully aware it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

If the mutant is not bloodied, it gets +5 to all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

#### 16. Springing Legs

*The beast can launch itself staggering distances, crashing down upon the unprepared.*

Once per turn, the mutant can jump up to 40 feet by spending 10 feet of movement. If the mutant has jumped 20+ feet straight toward a target immediately before it hits with an attack, it gains advantage on the attack roll.


#### 17. Sticky Smear 

*The beast is able to Release clinging webbing or thick mucus, which immobilize anything caught within.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn, when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, the creature is restrained by sticky mucus or webbing until it is destroyed (AC 15; HP 20; immune to bludgeoning, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage).


#### 18. Uncanny Senses

*The beast's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*

The mutant gets +5 on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 30 feet.

#### 19. Unsettling Scuttle

*Insectoid limbs lined with barbed hairs allow the beast to move in an off-putting, unpredictable manner. It skitters effortlessly across any terrain, bypassing foes without pause or penalty.*

The mutant has a climb speed equal to its walking speed and can climb on difficult surfaces, including along ceilings, and doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.


#### 20. Vile Toxins

*The beast’s venom is so potent that even the slightest scratch can deliver a fatal dose, sapping away life in mere seconds.*

Choose one of the mutant's natural weapons to become enhanced.

Once per turn, when the mutant hits with the enhanced weapon, the target must make a Constitution Saving Throw. *Failure:* The target is poisoned for the next minute. While poisoned, it can't regain hit points. At the end of each of its turns, the poisoned creature repeats the Constitution Saving Throw. *Success:* It ends the poison. *Failure:* It takes 14 (4d6) poison damage.

### Beastmen  Mutations List

The following is a list of mutations that can only be applied to beastmen. To pick a mutation at random, roll 1d6 and match the result to the number of the mutation.


#### 1. Arcane Fury

*The beastman’s horns act as arcane conduits, drawing in powerful magic and infusing it with potent mystic vigor.*

The beastman gains the following reaction:

 *Trigger:* When another creature within 15 feet of the beastman casts a 1st or higher level spell. *Response:* The beastman becomes Emboldened*. If the beastman already Emboldened, it may move up to half its speed and make a single gore attack. The attack has advantage if it is made against the creature that triggered the ability.



#### 2. Cursed Tongue

*Humility is anathema to the beastman. Should another cause it to appear weak or foolish, it responds by weaving a hex in its foul language—inflicting it upon the source of its shame.*

When the beastman loses the Emboldened* condition from missing with all of its attacks against the same creature on the same turn, it may curse a creature. It may also curse a creature when it loses the Emboldened condition due to being Charmed or Frightened by a creature. The curse lasts for one minute, until the beastman it becomes Emboldened again, or until the beastman dies. While cursed, whenever a target makes a d20 test, the target must subtract 1d6 from the roll. A creature can be cursed this way by more than one beastman at a time, and the effects stack.


#### 3. Disfiguring Hate

*The beastman’s fury warps its visage into a grotesque mask of rage. Its guttural roars of loathing echo forth, while a slick, rancid sweat seeps from its flesh, carrying a stench so hateful it stings the eyes—a living nightmare of repulsion.*


The beastman emits an aura in a 30-foot emanation <br> from itself while it is Emboldened* which forces <br> creatures to make the following saving throw. <br> *Wisdom Saving Throw:* Each enemy that <br> starts its turn in the emanation. <br> *Failure:* The creature is Frightened of <br> all Emboldened creatures until the <br> start of its next turn. 

If a creature would make <br> multiple saving throws against <br> the Disfiguring Hate abilities <br> of multiple beastmen, it instead <br> makes a single saving throw.  <br>The save DC equals the highest <br> save DC among the beastmen plus <br> 2 per saving throw that was forgone.

<br>

**New condition described at the <br> end of the document*

\columnbreak


#### 4. Fetid Soul

*So drenched in festering hatred is the beastman’s spirit that, as it tears free from its corpse in death, the vile essence fouls all it touches—leaving rot and hate in its wake.*

When the beastman dies while it is Emboldened*, it explodes, forcing creatures to make the following saving throw. *Constitution Saving Throw:* Each non-beastman creature within a 10-foot emanation of the beastman when it dies. *Failure:* The creature takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage and suffers a level of exhaustion. *Success:* Half damage only. 

Each beastman in the emanation becomes Emboldened if it is not already in one.



#### 5. Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorts the flow of magic around it.*

If the beastman fails a saving throw against a spell while Emboldened*, it can choose to end the Emboldened condition and succeed instead. If the beastman would take half damage on a success, it instead takes no damage.

#### 6. Wounded Rage

*Deep wounds and broken bones only drive the beastman to strive harder, dreading the judgment of its dark gods should it die in failure.* 

If the beastman is bloodied and Emboldened, it has advantage on attack rolls, and its attacks deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage on hit.

## Avatar of Beasts

From the echoing roars of ancient beasts to the silent stalk of the predator, nature begets a power all its own, an unchecked and relentless force. It is this raw, untamed energy that gives birth to an elemental known as an avatar of beasts, enigmatic entities born from the very soul of the wilderness.

**Primeval Visage.** These towering creatures walk upon the land with long, powerful strides. Their body is a blend of various animal spirits, giving them an almost unpredictable look, though most are bipedal with a vaguely humanoid body shape. A constant is their skull-like head adorned with antlers that rise like darkened spires. Eyes, pools of haunting luminescence, observe the world with primal intensity. Their vast hooved feet, capable of pulverizing any caught in their step, and their supernatural claws, an embodiment of nature's fury, are weapons of unparalleled savagery. With each individual avatar drawing upon various primal animal spirits, no two are exactly alike. One might have the scales of a serpent intermixed with the fur of a lion, while another might possess the feathery mantle and claws of an eagle combined with the armored hide of a rhino.

**Veil of the Wilds.** Despite their daunting size, avatars of beasts possess an uncanny ability to meld with the wilderness. They move through forests, mountains, and swamps as if they were phantoms, impervious to natural barriers and ever-prepared to ambush the unwary.

Their harmony with nature allows them to bypass any plant obstructions their forest homes might impose, making them almost impossible to anticipate.

**Supernatural Savagery.** In battle, these elementals are a spectacle of raw might and eldritch power. While their natural weapons—claws, antlers, and hooves—are deadly enough, their supernatural abilities add another level of terror. They can summon flocks of relentless birds whose sharp talons and beaks dive upon foes with murderous intent, often blinding their victims. When their foes amass to charge them head-on, avatars of beasts are even known to unleash rays of eerie and deadly supernatural light, thought to be the essence of the magic that makes up their being.

**Summoning the Beast.** While these elementals are free spirits of the wild, there are those with the knowledge to call upon them. Druids, shamans, and other mystics of the wilderness, in times of sheer desperation, might perform ancient and savage rituals to summon these mighty beings. These ceremonies are not to be taken lightly, often demanding a primeval sacrifice, where the essence of the wild is offered in exchange for the avatar's aid.

>
> ***Crashing Charge.*** If the avatar moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 11 (2d10) damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The creature makes the saving throw with disadvantage if the attack was made using its Bestial Take Down bonus action.
>
> ***One with the Wild.*** The avatar has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena and can do so when only lightly obscured. Additionally, the avatar can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them, and can move through trees as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 10 force damage if it ends its turn inside a tree.
>
> ***Primal Senses.*** The avatar has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on the checks in areas that are lightly obscured.
>
> ***Talons of the Forest.*** When the avatar makes an attack, it ignores half and three-quarters cover provided by foliage.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The avatar makes two attacks.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage.
>
> ***Savage Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) for each time this turn the target has already been hit with its Talon attack this turn.
>
> ***Pulverizing Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a prone creature, it cannot stand up until the end of the avatar's next turn unless it uses its action to succeed on a DC 20 Constitution check.
>
> ***Amber Breath (1/day).*** The avatar exhales amber light in a 60-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creatures gain no benefit from cover given by foliage for this saving throw.
>
> ***Flock of Doom.*** The avatar fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 100 feet of it with shadowy crows. The avatar can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by the crows. The sphere spreads around corners, and it lasts until the avatar uses the ability again, is more than 100 feet away from the area, or loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The sphere's area is difficult terrain, and creatures in it have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. At the end of each of the avatar's turns, each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 15 (6d4) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is surprised. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 8), it is blinded until the end of the avatar's next turn. On each of the avatar's turns, the avatar may move the crows 50 feet in any direction (no action required). Using this ability does not reveal the avatar if it is hidden from a creature.
> 
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Howl of the Great Beast (1/day).*** The avatar lets out a primeval howl. The avatar can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by it. Each affected creature within 120 feet of it that can hear it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes frightened of the avatar. The creature can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the avatar by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. At the end of its turn, the creature repeats the Wisdom save, ending the effect on it on a success.
>
> ***Bestial Take Down.*** The avatar makes one weapon attack. After the attack, the avatar falls prone. If it has 90 or fewer hit points, the attack is made with advantage.

### Avatar of Beasts Tactics
Avatars of Beasts are ambush predators and experts at stealthily navigating woodland environments to attack from optimal hidden positions. Knocking enemies prone will be their primary tactic throughout the fight as it allows them to stack successive talon attacks on a single target more easily. The avatar never flees from combat unless directed to by someone controlling it.

#### Special Abilities

&emsp;**Flock of Doom.** The avatar generally uses this ability at the start of the fight, ideally before it's even spotted by the players. The avatar will stay hidden for as long as possible while withering away the players with the flock. The avatar will only charge into combat if it manages to blind a vulnerable player it can reach, or one of the players spot it. While the flock is active during combat, the avatar will position it to hinder ranged attackers. 

**Amber Breath.** This ability is deployed when the avatar can hit three or more targets simultaneously. 

#### Attack Sequence

The avatar's primary targets are those blinded by its flock and any vulnerable prey it can reach. The target's distance and whether it's prone affects how the avatar will attack.<br><br>

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Available.** 
* The avatar uses Howl of the Great Beast.
* It then closes the distance and makes a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If finishes with a stomp attack.

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Not Available.** 
* The avatar uses its Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If it manages to knock the target prone, it will follow up with two stomp attacks; otherwise, it will make two talon attacks.

**Targets Beyond 60ft.**
* The avatar dashes to its target.
* The avatar uses the Bestial Take Down bonus action to make a gore attack.
* The avatar stands back up.
Note, if the avatar lacks the remaining movement to stand back up, it will be unlikely to use Bestial Takedown and leave itself vulnerable.

**Targets Already Prone.**
* The avatar attacks with two talon attacks.
* If both attacks hit, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make another talon attack.
* If any of the attacks miss, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a stomp attack.

### Avatar of Beasts Loot
Because these creatures are elementals, they don't have flesh and blood like mundane other creatures, and most of their body disintegrates when they die. Amidst the smokey ashes they leave behind, players may be able to salvage some bone or hide that remained corporeal or even some of their magical essence before it evaporates. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Avatar of Beasts Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Avatar of Beasts Loot Table

## The Brass Bull

The Brass Bull was once a formidable chieftain of a <br> powerful minotaur tribe, feared and respected by his kin. His reign took a dark turn when, in a fit of insatiable hunger and rage, he devoured the tribe's bray speaker shaman, a sacred figure who communed with their dark gods. This sacrilegious act incurred the wrath of the gods, who sent a host of demons to punish him for his blasphemy. However, in a display of unparalleled ferocity and strength, the Brass Bull consumed the very demons sent to destroy him.

As punishment for this defiance, the demons cursed him with a bloodthirsty madness, transforming him into a relentless slaughtering machine. The Brass Bull rampaged across the land, driven by an unending desire to kill, his sanity consumed by the curse. He would have continued his rampage until death from exhaustion, but the dark gods, intrigued by his indomitable will and savage power, intervened once more. They remade him with metallic flesh, rendering him immune to fatigue and making him an eternal engine of destruction.

Now, the Brass Bull burns with an infernal heat, his metallic body glowing with an unholy fire as he leads his clan on a never-ending rampage. His presence on the battlefield is a harbinger of doom, his unstoppable fury leaving a trail of carnage in his wake. His metallic hide is nearly impenetrable, a testament to the dark gods' craftsmanship. However, a single weak point exists—a spot that glows with a reddish heat where the metal is weakest. Those who dare to challenge the Brass Bull must strike this precise point to bring him down, a near-impossible feat given his ferocity and the chaos that surrounds him in battle.

>
> ***Weak Point.*** Whenever a creature has advantage on an attack roll against the Brass Bull, it can choose to roll only one die instead of two as it aims for the Brass Bull's weak point. If the attack hits, the Brass Bull has vulnerability to the damage from the attack. The attack still counts as having advantage for the purposes of other abilities such as a rogue's Sneak Attack. If any damage would reduce the Brass Bull to 0 hit points that did not target its weak point, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead. The Brass Bull only dies if reduced to 0 hit points from damage dealt to its weak point.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The Brass Bull uses its Dread Presence and makes two attacks with its Rune-Tortured Axe.
>
> ***Charge.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target takes an extra 4 (1d8) piercing damage for each 10 feet the Brass Bull moved in a straight line before the attack.
>
> ***Crushing Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage, the target takes an extra 4 (1d8) piercing damage for each 10 feet the Brass Bull moved in a straight line before the attack. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone. If the target fails by 10 or more, the creature is dazed* until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Dread Presence.*** Each creature of the Brass Bull's choice that is within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature can't cast spells other than cantrips. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Brass Bull's Dread Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Rune-Tortured Axe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage for each level of rampage the Brass Bull has.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The Brass Bull can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Brass Bull regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Check.** The Brass Bull makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Blood Call.** The Brass Bull chooses a creature that just took its turn, which it can see within 120 feet of it, calling it into battle by having the creature's own blood turn on it. At the start of the creature's next turn, the target may move on its turn toward the Brass Bull by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet of it. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal, except it can't move away from the Brass Bull willingly and can't teleport. If it doesn't choose to move this way, it takes 22 (4d10) force damage.
>
> **Building Fury.** The Brass Bull moves up to half its movement then makes a Rune-Tortured Axe attack against a creature that just took its turn. If the attack hits and deals damage, the Brass Bull gains a level of rampage, up to a maximum of ten levels. Each level increases the Brass Bull's speed by 5 feet. All levels of rampage are lost after one minute of not gaining a level.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If the Brass Bull is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its turn, it may immediately make that saving throw with advantage. It can use this legendary action even while incapacitated.
>
> **Vent Heat (Costs 2 Actions).** The Brass Bull burns the air around it, forcing each creature within 10 feet of it to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) fire damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer disadvantage on its next attack.
>
> ### Reaction
>
> ***Block.*** The Brass Bull adds +6 to its AC against one attack that would hit it. To use this reaction, the Brass Bull must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
>
> **New condition described on next page*

\pagebreakNum

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

### Epic Battle: Cataclysmic Onslaught
If you wish to turn the Brass Bull into an endgame threat, increase his Hit Points to 600 and give him the Cataclysmic Onslaught ability described below. These changes increase his Challenge Rating (CR) to 23.

### Cataclysmic Onslaught

When the Brass Bull rolls initiative, he can activate his Cataclysmic Onslaught. On initiative count 1 of each round during combat, he gains a new ability for the next minute on each following turn:

#### 1st Turn: Horrific Onslaught

The Brass Bull has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are frightened of him.

#### 2nd Turn: Eldritch Onslaught

At the start of his turn, the Brass Bull chooses one creature within 150 feet of him that he is aware of. The chosen creature is engulfed in an agonizing inferno, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage and is set on fire for one minute. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The target cannot benefit from being invisible and has disadvantage on attack rolls. A creature can use its action to douse the fire by making a DC 16 Dexterity check. The flames are also extinguished if the creature is fully submerged in water or standing in an area with strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour). At the end of each of its turns while on fire, the creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the Brass Bull gains a level of rampage.

#### 3rd Turn: Unyielding Onslaught

Spells and other magical effects can neither reduce his speed nor cause him to be paralyzed or restrained, and he can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has him grappled. Additionally, being underwater imposes no penalties on his movement or attacks.

#### 4th Turn: Bloodthirsty Onslaught

The Brass Bull has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have all its hit points.

\columnbreak

### The Brass Bull's Lair
The Brass Bull does not maintain a traditional lair or remain in one location for an extended period. Instead, he roams the land, selecting locations to wreak havoc upon—often choosing relatively isolated villages or farmlands near woods for his temporary lairs. From these bases, he methodically spreads terror among the nearby inhabitants.

When fighting within his lair, the Brass Bull's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 1.

#### Lair Actions
When the Brass Bull rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or the Brass Bull dies, the lair has an Intelligence 6 and can act of its own accord but always acts in the Brass Bull's best interest. While active this way, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

**Tide of Blood.** A wave of blood crashes down on an area within the lair, up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. If the Brass Bull is within the area of the wave, he takes no damage and instead regains 13 (3d8) hit points. If the wave passes through the space of three or more creatures, the Brass Bull gains a level of rampage.

**Seeping Wounds.** Wounded creatures within the lair begin to bleed profusely. Each creature with half or less of its hit points must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. Creatures at 0 hit points automatically fail this saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If two or more creatures fail this saving throw, the Brass Bull gains a level of rampage.

#### Regional Effects
The presence of the Brass Bull drastically affects his surroundings, bringing ruin and bloodshed that warp the land within 5 miles of his lair:

* Rivers in the area run red with blood.
* Corpses and other remains are preserved from decay and cannot become undead.
* Non-minotaur creatures within the area require three times the usual amount of rations per day. Additionally, any creature can consume raw meat without risk of sickness.
* Minotaurs in the area gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track or smell creatures that have lost more than half their hit points.

These effects gradually dissipate over 1d10 days after the Brass Bull's death.

### The Brass Bull Tactics

#### General Tactics
* **Dealing With Weak Point:** Prioritizes targets that consistently hit him with advantage, especially those resistant to his Dread Presence.
* **Block Reaction:** Reserves his reaction for the Block ability, using it against the attack likely to inflict the most damage.

#### Legendary Actions Usage
* **Building Fury:** Focuses on accumulating stacks of rampage whenever possible.
* **Blood Call:** Summons distant enemies closer for melee engagement.
* **Vent Heat:** Used when three or more targets can be hit simultaneously.

#### Cataclysmic Onslaught Tactics
* **1st Turn (Horrific Onslaught):** Targets those frightened by its dread presence to maximize rampage benefits, deviating from usual targets.
* **2nd Turn (Eldritch Onslaught):** Targets the creature furthest from its allies, limiting their ability to assist.
* **3rd Turn and Beyond:** Continues usual tactics, unaffected by the specific abilities used in previous onslaught turns.


### The Brass Bull Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the Brass Bull consist of what can be harvested from his demonically blessed form. Because his hide and flesh are metallic in nature, it's up to you what qualities you want to assign it and how the players harvest it. For example, you could have players make an **Intelligence (Smith's Tools)** or **Intelligence (Leatherworker's Tools)** to collect his hide. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

You may also opt to simply have the players collect weapons and equipment he was carrying or wearing.

#### The Brass Bull Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Bray Speakers


Beastman bray speakers occupy a <br> mystical and revered position within the <br> beastmen society, serving as the conduit between <br> the physical world and the dark, chaotic realms of their deities. Adorned with gnarled staves and a collection of arcane charms, icons, and fetishes - many of which are intricately woven into their fur - bray speakers present an eerie and formidable presence. 

As the primary spellcasters among the beastmen, bray speakers bear the responsibility of divining the will of their dark gods. They are deeply attuned to the chaotic energies that permeate their lands and use this connection to interpret signs and omens. This role places them at the center of the beastmen's ceremonies, often leading dark rituals that range from desecrating the forests to performing blood sacrifices of captives. These ceremonies are crucial in calling forth the herds from the depths of the forest, rallying them for war, or appeasing their savage gods.

The bray speakers are also the custodians of the sacred monoliths scattered throughout the forest. These ancient stones serve as focal points for the beastmen's mystical energies and are the sites of many of their most significant rituals. The power emanating from these monoliths is harnessed by the speakers to conduct powerful rites, strengthen their connection to the dark gods, and imbue their followers with otherworldly might.

In the hierarchical society of the beastmen, bray speakers often act as advisors and guides to chieftains and other leaders. Their insights are considered invaluable, ensuring that the strategies and plans of the herd align with the perceived desires of their gods. 

This role imbues them with considerable influence, often placing them at the right hand of the most powerful leaders. They are among the only beastmen that need not fear attacks or challenges from others of their kind, for none would dare to harm a conduit of the gods.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> ##### New Condition: Emboldened  
> This document references the Emboldened condition. 
> * The Emboldened condition always lasts one minute.
> * An Emboldened creature deals additional 7 (2d6) damage when it hits with a attack.
> * At the end of the creature's turn, the Emboldened condition ends early if it missed with all of its attacks that turn, it is charmed or frightened, or is effected by *calm emotions* spell. 
> 

<br>

Bray speakers in beastmen society exhibit an array of magical abilities, each specializing in different arcane lores that reflect their connection to the natural and supernatural realms. Those attuned to the Lore of the Wilds channel the raw, malevolent forces of nature, manipulating the elements to unleash devastating spells that work to undo civility in all its forms. 

Speakers versed in the Lore of Beasts have a deep affinity with animals, able to summon and control various creatures or bestow their herds with beast-like ferocity and strength. The practitioners of the Lore of Death delve into the morbid and necrotic, wielding spells that sap life, summon spirits, and spread decay, embodying the finality of all life. Lastly, those who master the Lore of Shadows are adept in manipulation and illusion, using their magic to cloak their movements, sow confusion among enemies, and strike from where they are least expected.

Bray speakers within beastmen society vary in power, from lesser speakers associated with small herds to great speakers who counsel the most powerful leaders. Lesser speakers focus on minor rituals and guidance for smaller groups, honing their skills and gaining knowledge as they aspire to greater influence. In contrast, great speakers, at the pinnacle of this hierarchy, possess profound connections to the dark gods. They play crucial roles in strategic decisions, oversee major rituals, and channel significantly more potent magic.  These revered speakers are integral to the planning of large-scale operations, with their insights viewed as divine mandates, commanding deep respect and fear from their kin.

In battle, bray speakers are formidable opponents, using their dark magic to both bolster their allies and wreak havoc upon their enemies. Their spellcasting is instinctual and deeply entwined with the primal fury of their race. Drawing on the raw energies of their primeval homes and the chaotic power of their gods, they can unleash devastating spells, sow confusion among enemy ranks, and invigorate their beastmen brethren. This combination of mystical prowess and savage instinct makes the bray speakers a fearsome force, embodying the untamed and unpredictable essence of the malevolent wilds.

### Bray Speaker Tactics

Bray speakers serve as the primary spellcasters of the beastmen war herds. Unlike most other spellcasters, they are fairly durable and can engage in melee combat while using their spells. With their Primal Fury active, bray speakers can cast spells while also making attacks. This makes them formidable foes as they don't suffer the vulnerabilities of most spellcasters and won't hesitate to dive into melee combat.

The following tactics assume the bray speaker is accompanied by at least two other beastmen.

The lore of magic a bray speaker is specialized in significantly influences its combat tactics. Below are tactics specific to the different lores and their spells:

#### Lore of Beasts

These bray speakers primarily serve a support role, which is helped by the fact that their Wild Heart trait works with most beastmen creatures.

##### Lore of Beasts Spells

**Pass Without Trace:** This ideally cast before combat begins. However, if allies can hide as a bonus action during combat, this spell remains useful during the fight.

**Amber Spear:** This should be cast when there's an opportunity to hit two or more targets.

**Aspect of the Beast:** This is typically cast on the speaker's most powerful ally. Ripping Jaws is generally the most useful for the Beastmen. With it, a beastman can use its Charge ability to topple a target and then bite with a higher chance of success. Additionally, the extra piercing damage from Primal Fury boosts the temporary hit points gained from the Ripping Jaws attack.

**Heroism:** This spell can be useful for either other beastmen or the speaker. It ensures the target isn't easily frightened, helping to mainain their Primal Fury. 

It's important to remember that this spell only benefits from the Wild Heart trait when cast at 1st level. For higher-level speakers, this often becomes their primary concentration spell.

**Monstrous Transformation:** This spell acts as a reset for the speaker. Upon transformation, the likelihood of reverting to their original form during combat is minimal. This spell is generally activated when the speaker's health drops below half or when it loses Primal Fury. While the transformed creature can't cast spells, any prior ongoing spells persist. 

Depending on the situation, the speaker might transform into a:

* **Manticore.** Preferable when adversaries have limited ranged capabilities

* **Hydra.** Chosen when foes have a lower damage output or can't focus their attacks on the transformed speaker

* **Dragon.** Optimal when opponents are grouped together, allowing the dragon's breath to hit multiple targets or when facing adversaries with high elemental damage output.

\pagebreakNum



#### Lore of Shadows
The Shadow Paths trait of this lore works well when combined with beastmen who have the Charge ability. By swapping places with units like besthorns or warhorns, the speaker can help them get in repeated charges during a fight.

##### Lore of Shadows Spells
**Pit of Shadows:** This spell is used at the earliest opportunity when it can affect two or more targets.

**Mystifying Miasma:** This is the speaker's go-to opening spell, unless *Pit of shadows* is available. It's used to disperse tightly packed enemy formations.

**Penumbral Pendulum:** This is employed when it can strike two or more foes. After casting it, the speaker's allies may attempt to grapple and restrain adversaries, ensuring they remain within the pendulum's path.

**Unseen Lurker:** This spell generally targets the speaker's strongest ally and is cast when no other spells take precedence or if the speaker requires an urgent retreat.

**Shroud of Dusk:** This spell is particularly handy during close-quarters combat. If the bray speaker knows it will have disadvantage on its next attack, this spell's darkness can level the playing field by canceling out any sources of advantage and disadvantage for most creatures in its area.

#### Lore of Death

Bray speakers practicing the Lore of Death tend to reserve their more potent spells for later rounds of combat, capitalizing on the enhanced power derived from their Leech Life ability.

##### Lore of Death Spells

**Circle of Death:** Given its vast area of effect, speakers prefer to cast this spell prior to engaging in melee combat, ensuring maximum enemy exposure.



**Aspect of Dread:** This spell is typically used after the speaker engages in melee combat. After charging in and making a Gore attack, the speaker will cast this spell while surrounded by foes to sow fear.



**Impending Doom:** This spell should target formidable enemy frontline fighters. This will help other beastmen knock them over with charging attacks.

**Inflict Wounds:** Speakers are patient with this spell, waiting for an opportune moment to strike a target when they have advantage.

**Crippling Pain:** This is best cast on agile skirmishers like monks or rogues. Its potency is amplified when targeting a prone adversary, as the act of standing further exacerbates the damage the target takes.


#### Lore of The Wild
Bray speakers dedicated to this lore tend to be less melee-focused, especially those with access to the Savage Domain spell. The majority of their spells require concentration, but their Bestial Surge trait allows them to maintain multiple spells at once, and they will often have at least one spell going that can help them disrupt the concentration of enemy spellcasters.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



##### Lore of the Wild Spells

**Savage Dominion:** This spell is cast pre-combat unless doing so would jeopardize a surprise attack. While maintaining concentration on this spell, the speaker keeps its distance, remaining within 60 feet of the summoned monster. The type of summoned creature is typically random unless the speaker possesses prior knowledge about adversaries.

The choices are:

* **Giant:** Chosen if adversaries are adept at avoiding melee or are fighting at a distance

* **Jabberwocky:** Chosen when the objective is to hamper foes with the creature's Burble and other debilitating effects. (Remember that the Burble ability is indiscriminate, potentially affecting even the speaker if it gets too close.)

* **Behemoth:** A versatile monster, adept at singling out and consuming targets, as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

**Mad Rampage:** This should be cast on a unit with multiple attacks. Great speakers might cast it on the creature summoned with *savage domain*.

**Vile Tide:** This should be used when it can target two or more opponents or disrupt a spell-concentrating foe, especially if *devolve* has already been used on them.

**Primal Scream:** This should be reserved for critical moments. It's typically cast on the speaker itself or on powerful allies like a warhorn or a creature summoned by *savage domain*. It's most effective when the targeted unit is at half-health and can affect at least two foes with the scream.

**Devolve:** This spell is saved for when the speaker can target an enemy spellcaster with it.

## Beastman Infantry
The hierarchy of the beastmen is primarily determined by strength and brutality. The bulk of beastmen are known as longhorns and represent the typical members of their kind. Beneath them are the wretched shorthorns who represent the dregs of their society, and above them are the elite besthorns who lord over the rest of their kin. All these beastmen make up the infantry fighters of a beastmen force going to war and are typically lead by the most powerful among them. Warhorns lead smaller war herds or serve as secondary leaders in large war herds, which are typically led by the most powerful of all beastman warriors: the beastlords.

### Shorthorns
Shorthorns, the lowest caste among the beastmen, are a pitiful sight to behold in their dark, twisted society. These lesser beastmen are easily recognized by their diminutive, stunted horns, a physical manifestation of their lowly status within the brutal hierarchy of their kin. Their horns, small and often malformed, set them apart as the weakest and least respected of their race.

Physically, shorthorns possess a devilish appearance, with gaunt frames, sharp, angular features, and eyes that gleam with malice and cunning. Their snarling expressions reveal a nature twisted by resentment and cruelty. Despite their smaller stature and less imposing presence, there is something undeniably sinister about their demeanor, a reflection of the bitterness that festers in their hearts.



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This low status among their brethren imbues the shorthorns with a deep-seated cruelty. They are often treated with contempt and abuse by the larger, stronger beastmen, which in turn makes the shorthorns resentful and vindictive. Given the opportunity, they vent this malice with savage glee, particularly upon captured prisoners who fall into their clutches. 
Their treatment of such unfortunates is merciless and filled with inventive brutality, a means for them to exert power in the few ways they can.

Despite their low rank, shorthorns are essential to the functioning of a beastmen herd. They perform duties that others have no patience for or are too clumsy to handle, such as maintaining weapons and equipment. Their dexterous fingers are well-suited for intricate tasks, and they often find themselves tending to the arms and armor of their more formidable kin, a role that, while menial, is crucial for the warband's effectiveness.

In the chaos of battle, shorthorns are typically relegated to the role of expendable light infantry. Their weak and cowardly nature is well-known, and they are often sent to the front lines as cannon fodder. In the heat of combat, their lack of courage becomes apparent; they are quick to flee at the first sign of the tide turning against them. This behavior reinforces their status as the lowest of their kind, yet their numbers and willingness to swarm the enemy in droves can sometimes turn the tide in a skirmish, albeit at a great cost to their own ranks.

#### Shorthorn Tormentors
Some shorthorns achieve a special level of notoriety, <br> earning them the title Tormentor. These shorthorns, renowned for their exceptional cruelty and proficiency <br> in torture, wield poisonous spears with chilling <br> expertise. Unlike their typical counterparts, tormentors <br> are feared and respected, not for brute strength, but for <br> their ability to inflict prolonged agony. Their spears, laced with lethal toxins from forest flora and fauna, are designed <br> to incapacitate and torture rather than kill swiftly. In battle, these weapons become instruments of terror, <br> foreshadowing the grim fate of those who fall into their clutches, and they take deviant glee in ganging up on vulnerable targets.

The tormentors' notoriety, however, is most pronounced <br> in their role as skilled torturers. Their gruesome methods are a perverse art form, earning them a unique, elevated status within the beastmen's brutal society. Beastmen chieftains often entrust them with the torture of particularly hated captives, a task they relish. This grim responsibility grants the Tormentors a level of respect and authority rarely afforded to other shorthorns.

#### Shorthorn Raiders

Shorthorn raiders occupy a unique and vital role within the ranks of the beastmen. As specialists in scouting and ranged combat, these shorthorns distinguish themselves through their proficiency with crudely made bows, a rarity in a culture that typically favors brute force and melee combat. Their skill with these weapons, combined with their natural agility and stealth, makes them ideal scouts and ranged support for the more brutish members of their kind. Shorthorn raiders are adept at moving silently through dense forests, their keen eyes and sharp senses constantly scanning for signs of the enemy or opportunities for ambush.

The intelligence gathered by these raiders is invaluable to the beastmen chieftains, enabling them to coordinate devastating ambushes and strike at prime targets with little to no warning. Their ability to relay critical information about enemy movements, weaknesses, and terrain plays a pivotal role in the beastmen's guerrilla warfare tactics. In the heat of battle, shorthorn raiders skulk on the fringes, loosing volleys of arrows into the enemy ranks, sowing chaos and confusion from a distance while their brethren engage in close-quarters bloodshed.

However, the ambitions of the shorthorn raiders often extend beyond mere reconnaissance. Emboldened by their mastery of stealth and archery, they sometimes undertake their own raids, pillaging and burning villages when they believe they can evade retribution. These raids are swift and brutal, characterized by a sudden onslaught of arrows followed by the merciless slaughter of any who survive the initial assault.

#### Shorthorn Stalkers

Shorthorn stalkers represent the pinnacle of skill and discipline among the shorthorn raiders, setting a standard for stealth and skirmishing tactics that few in the beastmen ranks can match. These elite raiders are renowned for their hit-and-run tactics, striking with precision and vanishing before the enemy can mount a proper defense. Their exceptional agility and mastery of the terrain allow them to navigate the densest forests and roughest terrains with ease, making them the perfect operatives for quick, devastating strikes. 

As scouts, the shorthorn stalkers are remarkably reliable and disciplined, a trait that is somewhat atypical in the often chaotic and impulsive beastmen society. They excel in reconnaissance, gathering crucial information about enemy positions, numbers, and movements with a level of efficiency that is invaluable to any beastman chieftain. Their reports are precise and timely, allowing for the swift planning of raids and ambushes. In the field, they act as the eyes and ears of the beastmen warbands, ensuring that their brute force is applied with strategic cunning and surprise, maximizing the impact of their attacks.

The role of the shorthorn stalkers in the beastmen hierarchy is unique. Despite their lowly origins, their skills and contributions are indispensable, earning them a place of unique value in the herd. They are the silent, deadly shadow of the beastmen hordes, often the difference between a successful raid and a disastrous engagement.

### Longhorns

Longhorns are the primary representation of a beastman, forming the backbone of their savage herds. They are a fearsome blend of animal and human. Their lower bodies boast powerful, goat-like, bipedal legs, adept for traversing rough, forested terrains with ease. Their human-like torsos and arms showcase grotesque but powerful muscles. Above this, their heads are akin to that of a fanged goat, complete with menacing horns. However, within their ranks, many variations of beastman can exist, exhibiting a mix of traits from different wild animals. This diversity adds to their terrifying presence, as each longhorn presents a unique yet uniformly intimidating appearance.

The longhorns make up the majority of the beastmen herds. Their numbers are vast, and they form the core of the beastmen's marauding forces. Characterized by their rowdy and impulsive nature, longhorns are creatures of instinct and aggression. They are quick to anger, and once provoked, their fury is relentless and brutal. This temperament, while often chaotic, is a significant asset in the heat of battle, as it fuels their ferocity and resilience. However, once they lose their momentum and their fury burns out, they can become less confident and unreliable fighters.

Longhorns are primarily melee combatants, relying on their natural speed and brute strength to overpower their foes. They typically lack discipline, and their equipment is often crudely made and poorly maintained, but what they lack in finesse, they more than make up for with sheer rage-fueled power. Their approach to battle is straightforward and savage: they charge headlong into enemy ranks, using their horns, teeth, and any weapon at hand to wreak havoc. This makes them excellent shock troops, capable of breaking enemy lines through sheer force and the intimidating might of their charge. Foes knocked prone by the charge of their horns are quickly dogpiled by other beastmen who relish the opportunity to prey on a newly vulnerable victim.

#### Longhorn Ravagers

Longhorn ravagers, a notorious subgroup within the beastman ranks, are as feared for their chaotic behavior as they are for their combat prowess. Known for their love of potent, rank brews, these ravagers are seldom seen without their signature flasks or containers of alcohol. This drink, foul to any but their own kind, serves as a source of inebriation and a form of battle stimulant. In the midst of combat, the intoxicating effects of their brew do more than impair; they invigorate the ravagers, fueling their already formidable aggression and bolstering their confidence. This alcohol-induced bravado often turns the tide of battle, as the ravagers, lost in their drunken fury, become even more fearsome and unpredictable adversaries.

The longhorn ravagers have also developed a unique fighting style that incorporates their drinking vessels. Whether it's a crude mug, a battered flask, or even an entire keg, these containers are not just for holding their brew but are also cleverly used as improvised shields. This unconventional approach to defense is surprisingly effective, allowing the ravagers to absorb blows that would fell lesser beastmen. 


\columnbreak

<br>

Despite their drunken demeanor, the destructive power of the longhorn ravagers should not be underestimated. Their alcohol-induced courage often leads them to hold their ground in the face of overwhelming odds, where other beastmen might break and flee. This tenacity, coupled with their wild, unpredictable nature, makes them unlikely elite warriors. In battle, the ravagers are the embodiment of chaotic strength, a whirlwind of fury and resilience, their roars of inebriated rage echoing as both a battle cry and a warning to all who face them.

> ##### Number of Swig Uses
> The default number of uses of the Swig represents the average amount of drink a longhorn is carrying with it at any given time. There may be a reason why a longhorn would have more or less drink on its person, and you can adjust the number of daily uses of the Swig ability to reflect this.

### Besthorns
Besthorns stand at the pinnacle of the beastman hierarchy, representing the most elite and formidable warriors within their brutal society. These fearsome creatures bear a resemblance to their longhorn brethren, but they are distinguished by their grander, more majestic horns and more robust, powerful physiques. While they may be of the same stock as longhorns, besthorns view themselves as a class apart, seeing the longhorns as inferior and unworthy of comparison. 

Armed and armored with the finest spoils of war, Besthorns have access to the best equipment looted from countless raids. Their weapons are often of higher quality the herd can get their hands on, and their armor is more complete and protective than that of the average beastman. This access to superior gear is a privilege earned through their proven prowess in battle and their elevated status in the herd. The sight of a besthorn donned in heavy armor wielding a massive battle axe is both imposing and terrifying, a testament to their position as the apex predators of their society.

In terms of combat skill and discipline, besthorns are a step above the typical longhorn. They are more battle-hardened and tactically astute, capable of executing complex strategies and holding the line where others might falter. This discipline and martial prowess make them the preferred choice for the chieftain's personal retinue, serving as both elite guards and the most trusted warriors in the herd. Their presence in a chieftain's entourage is a clear sign of his strength and the respect he commands.

However, the ambition and strength of the besthorns often put them in a position to challenge for leadership. It is among their ranks that contenders for the title of chieftain most frequently arise. These challenges are brutal and decisive, for in the world of the beastmen, might makes right, and the strongest rule. The besthorns, with their superior abilities and equipment, are often the most likely to succeed in these contests, ensuring that the leadership of the herd remains in the hands of the most formidable and fearsome among them.

#### Besthorn Manrippers
Besthorn manrippers are the embodiment of sheer brutality and skill within the already formidable ranks of the mesthorns. These elite warriors have honed their mastery of the massive greataxes, weapons that are as deadly as they are symbolic of their wielders' status and power. The manrippers have earned their fearsome title through countless battles, where they demonstrated an uncanny ability to cleave through multiple foes in a single, devastating swing. 

The greataxes wielded by the manrippers are not just tools of war; they are extensions of their own savage nature. Honed to be as lethal as possible, these axes are capable of delivering strikes that not only cut through armor and bone but can also bisect an opponent with terrifying ease. The manrippers have perfected the use of these axes to such a degree that what might be a survivable blow from another warrior becomes a deadly, maiming strike in their hands. Their ability to turn the tide of battle with a few well-placed swings makes them both valuable and feared assets in any beastman warband.

In the ranks of the beastmen, the besthorn manrippers are viewed with a mixture of jealous awe and cowering terror. Their presence on the battlefield is enough to demoralize enemies and inspire their fellow beastmen with their sheer ferocity and combat prowess. As they wade through enemy ranks, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake, the manrippers embody the apex of beastman martial ability. They are not just fighters; they are symbols of the raw, unbridled power and savagery that define the beastmen's way of war, making them a terrifying force to be reckoned with.

### Beastmen Chieftains
Beastman chieftains stand as towering figures of power <br> and authority within the savage society of the beastmen. These formidable leaders have risen through the ranks,  often through sheer strength and brutality, to a position where they command entire herds. Their ascent to power is a testament to their prowess in battle and their ability to dominate and control their kin, traits revered among the beastmen. A chieftain is not just a leader; they are the epitome of what a beastman aspires to be - strong, commanding, and fearsome.

Filled with a supreme sense of confidence and superiority, beastman chieftains view themselves as above all other creatures. This arrogance is not unfounded, as their physical and martial capabilities often far exceed those of their subordinates. Their mere presence on the battlefield is a source of inspiration for other beastmen, bolstering their confidence and battle fury. The chieftain's roar of command or charge into battle can ignite the frenzied rage of their herd, transforming a disorganized mob into a focused, albeit still chaotic, fighting force. Under the leadership of a chieftain, the beastmen become more than just a rabble of savages; they become a terrifying wave of destruction.

Coordinating the chaotic and unruly nature of the beastmen herds is no small feat, and it is here that the chieftains truly demonstrate their leadership. They are the strategists and coordinators behind the beastmen's raids and battles, adept at deploying their forces against the most hated enemies of their kind. Often, a chieftain is advised by a speaker, a mystical figure who provides guidance on the spiritual and strategic aspects of their campaigns. This speaker advisor plays a crucial role in decision-making, offering insights on when and how to best utilize the beastmen under the chieftain's command so that they best fulfill the will of their dark gods.

#### Warhorns

Warhorns are formidable figures within <br> their herds, having fought fiercely to attain <br> their dominant positions. Their rise to power <br> is a testament to their unmatched strength and combat prowess, setting them apart from the other ranks within the beastmen society. These leaders see themselves as superior, not just in terms of physical might but also in their ability to command and direct the actions of their herd. Their authority is undisputed, born from a brutal culture where strength and the ability to instill fear are the keys to leadership.

Unlike typical leaders who might engage in the intricacies of governance, warhorns are singularly focused on maintaining their authority and orchestrating the acts of raiding and warfare that define the beastmen's existence. They are less concerned with the day-to-day affairs of the herd, leaving the herd to squabble amongst themselves. Their primary concern lies in ensuring that their position of dominance remains unchallenged. This involves a balance of displaying ruthless strength to deter potential challengers and demonstrating enough strategic wisdom to lead successful raids and battles. The life of a warhorn is one of constant vigilance and aggression, as any sign of weakness could invite challenges from ambitious underlings.

#### Beastlords
Beastlords represent the apex of power and authority in the savage hierarchy of the beastmen. They are formidable figures, towering above even the mighty warhorns in terms of strength, leadership, and sheer presence. A beastlord's rule extends not just over a single herd but over multiple warherds, which they unite into a single, overwhelming force of destruction. Their ability to command and coordinate such a vast array of brutal warriors is a testament to their unparalleled dominance and strategic acumen. In the world of the beastmen, where might and ferocity are the cornerstones of power, the beastlords are the ultimate embodiment of these traits.

Under a beastlord's command, warhorns serve as lieutenants or subcommanders, each overseeing individual herds within the larger force. This structure allows the beastlord to exert control over a massive number of troops, delegating responsibilities to these trusted commanders while maintaining overall strategic direction. 

<br>

\columnbreak

<br><br>

The warhorns, in turn, respect and fear the beastlord, recognizing their superior strength and the privilege of serving under such a powerful leader. This hierarchy ensures that the beastlord's will is executed efficiently and ruthlessly across the multiple herds under their dominion.

To the other beastmen, a Beastlord is more than just a leader; he is seen as the living embodiment of the will of their dark gods. When a Beastlord unites the warherds for a campaign, he is perceived as a divine mandate, a signal that a great wave of destruction is about to be unleashed upon the civilized world. This belief imbues the beastmen with fanatical zeal, as they view their campaigns under a beastlord's command as sacred acts of war, destined to bring ruination and chaos in the name of their dark deities. The appearance of a beastlord at the head of a united beastmen force is a dire portent, heralding a time of strife and devastation for all who stand against them.

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Shorthorn Tactics
These beastmen are weak and cowardly by nature and will usually only press an attack if they feel they have an advantage that tips the odds in their favor. This advantage could range from a surprise attack to overwhelming numbers or the use of forested terrain to launch hit-and-run attacks. Once they feel they're on the winning side, shorthorns will charge in with the same reckless ferocity common to most beastmen.

##### Shorthorn Tormentors
These beastmen typically move ahead of the rest of their warband, setting up ambushes that their allies can capitalize on. If they can pull off the ambush, they'll use their poisonous attacks to weaken players and leave them more susceptible to the charges of other beastmen. Once an enemy is prone, the tormentors will surround it and ensure it can't get back up. These tactics make tormentors ideal allies for stronger beastmen like longhorns and besthorns.

##### Shorthorn Raiders and Stalkers
These beastmen are unique in that they avoid rushing into battle to use their Charge ability. Instead, they specialize in targeting foes their allies can't reach in close combat. They are skillful and opportunistic archers and will take cover between their attacks whenever possible.

\columnbreak

<br>

#### Longhorn Tactics
Longhorns make up the bulk of most beastmen warherds. When fighting together, they form a rowdy mob drunk on their confidence and recklessly charging into enemies. If the fight doesn't quickly go in their favor, sobering reality may set in, causing them to break and flee if they don't have a leader keeping them in line.

##### Longhorn Ravagers
These beastmen's signature ability is Swig. They will typically expend a use of the ability just before combat, letting the poisoned condition clear while retaining the temporary hit points. 

In the heat of battle, they will use the Swig ability again if they lose their Primal Fury or they drop below half health. It's important that they use Swig after they've made their attacks for the turn so they can minimize the disadvantage from being poisoned.

Because of their drunken nature, these beastmen will be even more wild and reckless than the rest of their kin, and you can reflect this by having them take more foolhardy actions in combat.

#### Besthorns
Because these elite warriors wear medium armor and don't have the Bestial Ambush trait, they are not as reliant on stealth and ambush tactics as other beastmen. If they're teamed up with other beastmen who have Bestial Ambush, the besthorns will charge the players first. This will allow the sneakier beastmen an opportunity to move around and attack from behind while the players are distracted.

##### Besthorn Manrippers
These beastmen prioritize attacking targets with low Strength so they can best utilize their Hewing Greataxe attacks. However, if the enemies they can reach all have high AC or abilities that make them hard to hit, the manrippers will change their strategy to attacking foes that are grouped up so they can attempt to make use of their Arcing Swing ability.

#### Warhorns and Beastlords
These beastmen leaders fight from within the center of their minions, extending their aura to as many beastmen as possible. Because they're constantly seeking the favor of their dark gods, they will often challenge the most powerful adversaries they can find to prove their worth.

Because of their armor, their ambush options are often limited, and so they typically use the same combat initiation tactics as besthorns.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## The Dark Omen

The Dark Omen is a figure of dread and awe within the annals of human legend and folklore, a bray speaker whose name is whispered in fearful tones. His physical form is a grotesque testament to his dark powers, marked distinctly by a pair of large, tattered crow wings sprouting from his back. These wings are often kept hidden under his hide cloak, but when outstretched, they are revealed to be black as the deepest night and as ominous as the shadows dancing at the firelight's edge. They are seen as a physical embodiment of his cursed connection to the dark gods.

The coming of The Dark Omen is always foretold by a series of dark portents and ominous signs. In woodland regions, locals speak of strange hoofprints leading up to their door, flocks of crows that blot out the sun, and a sense of dread that settles over the land like a suffocating blanket. These supernatural occurrences have elevated The Dark Omen to a figure of religious superstition and fearful reverence among those living near the forests. Some unfortunate souls may even catch a glimpse of the creature leering from the shadowy forest edge, an event which all but guarantees impending misfortune and doom.

When he emerges from the darkest depths of the ancient forests, The Dark Omen is more than just a leader among the beastmen; he is the harbinger of doom and a prophet of despair.

 His origins are shrouded in mystery, with rumors suggesting he was chosen by the dark gods themselves, transformed from a mere beastman into a being of immense mystical power. His eyes are said to blaze with an unholy light, piercing through the shadows of the forest, and his voice carries the weight of prophecy, his words twisting the minds of those who hear them.

The Dark Omen's ruinous reputation is built upon countless desecrated shrines and fallen enemies, his mere presence spreading fear and chaos. He is not only a master of dark sorcery but also a tactician of savage warfare, leading his herds in brutal raids against civilization. His command over the beastmen is absolute, his will enforced not just by strength but by the sheer terror he invokes. In battle, he wields his malevolent magic with devastating effect, cursing his foes and bolstering his followers with the primal fury of the wilds.

Legend has it that The Dark Omen seeks to fulfill a dire prophecy, one that foretells a great reckoning that will engulf the world in chaos and darkness. As he moves unseen through the forest, the beating of his crow wings is said to be an omen of the dark times to come, a reminder that the beastmen are ever waiting at the edge of the civilized lands, ready to reclaim the world in the name of their sinister deities.

### Epic Encounter
If you wish to make The Dark Omen into a threat for end-game players, you can make the following enhancements:

* Increase his hit points to 600
* Increase the AC granted by his natural armor to 17
* Give him proficiency in Strength and Dexterity saving throws (increasing his modifier to +8 for Strength and +7 for Dexterity)
* Increase his CR to 20


### The Dark Omen's Lair
The Dark Omen does not keep a traditional lair or even stay in one area for long. Instead, he roams the land before choosing a location to bring ruination upon. This is usually a relatively isolated village or farmland near woods where he can establish a temporary lair. From here, The Omen slowly begins to sow terror among everyone living nearby.

When fighting within his lair, The Dark Omen's CR increases by 1.

#### Lair Actions

When fighting inside his lair, The Dark Omen can invoke the ambient magic that has saturated his temporary abode to use his lair action. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), The Dark Omen can cause the following effects, even while incapacitated:

Creatures without the Primal Fury or Unholy Fury abilities in the layer must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is overwhelmed by a sense of abject defeat until initiative count 20 on the next round. While overwhelmed this way, a creature can't add their proficiency bonus to saving throws, checks, attack rolls, or their spell save DC for spells they cast. If three or more creatures fail the saving, The Dark Omen gains a level of power for his Unholy Fury trait if the ability is active.

#### Regional Effects
Any region where The Dark Omen dwells for a significant amount of time is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of his lair:

* Strange footprints appear across the area, going up vertical surfaces, solid objects, and sometimes mysteriously disappearing with no trace. These footprints prevent The Dark Omen from being tracked except by magical means while in the area.
* Clouds in the sky form into leering horned skulls and other twisted faces.
* Beasts within the area become highly aggressive and agitated, causing creatures other than The Dark Omen to have disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks while in the area.
* Crows and carrion birds become predominant in the area and can telepathically communicate with The Dark Omen while he is in the area.

If Dark Omen dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

##### Dark Omen Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Omen's Shadow:** Rumors spread across the region of unnatural phenomena – crops failing, wildlife behaving erratically, and dark visions plaguing the dreams of the villagers. These signs are believed to herald the arrival of The Dark Omen. The players must investigate these omens, protect the affected communities, and uncover the true intention of The Dark Omen's visitation.|
|  2  |**Pact of the Crow:** A village leader, desperate to protect his people from the beastmen's raids, has struck a dangerous bargain with The Dark Omen. The players are drawn into a complex situation where they must deal with the consequences of the leader's actions and confront The Dark Omen to prevent a greater evil from unfolding. |
|  3  | **The Doomed Village:** A village on the forest’s edge is suffering from a mysterious curse since The Dark Omen was sighted nearby. Villagers are vanishing, and those remaining speak of terrifying nightmares. The players need to break the curse, rescue the missing villagers, and confront the source of this dark magic.   |
|  4  | **The Crow Feather’s Trail:** A series of occult crimes and strange events in a city are linked by a single clue – a crow's feather, a known symbol of The Dark Omen. The players must unravel this mystery, leading them on a trail that connects the city's dark underbelly to the ominous forests and ultimately to The Dark Omen himself.  |

### Dark Omen Tactics
The Dark Omen is a formidable spellcaster who is also adept in melee combat. He specializes in casting spells that are most effective at close range. Thanks to his fly speed, The Dark Omen excels in repositioning himself for optimal attacks and spellcasting.

**Minion Interaction:** While The Dark Omen can be an effective solo encounter, he works best with minions.

#### Spells
The Dark Omen's primary ability is Unholy Frenzy, which enhances his spellcasting power as combat progresses. Creatures attempting to charm, frighten, or interfere with the Dark Omen's ability to make Wisdom checks become his primary targets. The Dark Omen is a tactical spellcaster and avoids using spells on targets likely to resist them.

##### Summon Flock
The Dark Omen can cast this spell at will and should always have it active so that he gains a +12 bonus to Perception, bringing his passive Perception up to 22. Attacks made with this spell also benefit from the Unholy Fury trait.

##### Withering Resolve
Cast this spell on creatures likely to interfere with The Dark Omen's Unholy Frenzy checks, particularly targets lacking proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

##### Primal Scream
* **Use Case 1:** Cast when it can affect more than two targets.
* **Use Case 2:** Cast if The Dark Omen is airborne and is confronted by another flying opponent with low Constitution.

##### Impending Doom 
Best cast on targets with low Charisma or on those already under the effects of Withering Resolve

##### Wind of Death
Effective when it can hit two or more targets

##### Horrifying Laughter vs. Pit of Shadows
* **Horrifying Laughter:** Preferable when targeting a creature whose saving throw has been lowered, especially if it's already affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*
* **Pit of Shadows:** Generally a better choice when it can affect two or more creatures with lower Dexterity, particularly if no target is affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*

##### Savage Dominion vs. Purple Sun
Both spells are extremely devastating, but their usage depends on specific conditions:

* **Purple Sun:** Cast this spell when Dark Omen has 100 or more hit points and is not suffering from any crippling conditions.

* **Savage Dominion:** Opt for this spell if Dark Omen's action economy is low or he anticipates defeat in the next round. The summoned creature persists even after Dark Omen's demise.

##### Creatures Summoned With Savage Dominion
The preferred creature can depend on the state of the battle:
* **Giant:** Ideal for situations where adversaries excel in avoiding melee combat or are engaged in long-range fighting
* **Jabberwocky:** Ideal for disrupting enemies with its Burble ability and other debilitating effects. Note that the Burble ability can affect anyone in proximity, including The Dark Omen
* **Behemoth:** A versatile choice suited for targeting and consuming individual targets as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

#### Legendary Actions
When The Dark Omen is not in debilitating terrain and is surrounded by less than two enemies, it primarily uses its legendary actions to cast spells. If The Dark Omen finds itself in debilitating terrain or surrounded by two or more enemies, it will prioritize using its actions to reposition itself. When moving, The Dark Omen aims to move from one target. This strategic movement is designed to maximize the benefits of its Charge ability for its Gore attack at the end of its movement.

## Jabbersnarls
*Repugnant Monstrosities of Fear & Madness*<br>
**Habitat:** Forest, Swamp, Underdark; **Treasure:** Any <br>
Among the most ancient groves, tainted by the malevolent presence of chaos, countless nightmares have crawled forth from the undergrowth. Yet none are more revolting than the jabbersnarl. Its array of legs—a grotesque mingle of insect and amphibian—rival the thickness of pine trees, each tipped with lethal talons that dig into the ground, ushering the beast forward as it drags its misbegotten, bloated, toad-like frame. Its bulk is so immense that even the mightiest ox would be crushed beneath its girth. Trailing behind, a terrible serpentine tail sways, tipped with a mace-like appendage sporting spiky protrusions as long as a greatsword. Upon its back rest a pair of massive, leathery wings, folded until splayed and bent, inexplicably lifting its disjointed mass into the air.

Most grotesque of all is the creature’s amalgamated head. Large ram horns crown its bulbous skull, beneath which sit sets of slitted eyes, each independently searching for its next meal. When a victim strays into its sight, the jabbersnarl opens its toad-like maw, revealing rows of jagged, shark-like teeth lining the interior. Amidst them, a mass of twitching chelicerae writhes, and between these sits a proboscis-like tongue. This tongue can launch as swiftly as an arrow with deadly precision, ensnaring creatures as strong as a full-grown minotaur and dragging them back to its lethal assortment of teeth. There, they are shredded and swallowed into its cavernous gut—all before most prey even realize their terrible fate.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Even if a creature manages to strike back at this eclectic array of deadly limbs, the jabbersnarl does not bleed blood. Instead, an acidic slime courses through its veins, spurting from wounds to eat through nearby flesh, wood, and steel. Yet the true lethality of this abominable creature lies in its very presence—for its amalgamated body is a magnification of nature’s most horrifying aspects, and the mere sight of such a horrid miscreation causes madness to run rampant. Those who lay eyes upon the jabbersnarl find their sanity eroded. As their minds break, some drop to the ground, curling into a ball, feebly attempting to process the monstrosity before them. Others gut themselves to escape the odious display, while some sink into such deep denial that they refuse to acknowledge the creature’s existence, even as its corded tongue latches onto them and pulls them to their doom.

jabbersnarls are drawn to the commotions and cries of the beastmen who share their corrupted woods, knowing such sounds lead to bountiful prey upon which they may gorge. This attraction can prove hazardous to the beastmen, for even they, worshippers of chaos’s foul deities, are not immune to the delirium the jabbersnarl’s appearance inspires. If insufficient enemies are present to sate its ravenous hunger, it may turn to feed on the herd that beckoned it. However, powerful Bray-Speakers can direct its unearthly cravings, steering it toward foes while ensuring it keeps a wide berth from the rest of the war party. When such manipulations succeed, the warherd greets the occasion with joyful braying, watching the misshapen figure of the jabbersnarl tumble from the sky, crashing into the midst of a disciplined army. All order shatters, replaced by hysteria as the beast wreaks its havoc.

> ***Visage of Madness.*** The jabbersnarl emits an aura in a 60-foot emanation from itself. *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 18, each enemy that starts its turn in the emanation and can see the jabbersnarl. *Failure:* The creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d6 to determine its actions during that turn. *Fails By 5 or More:* The creature rolls 2d6 instead. *Fails By 10 or More:* The creature rolls 3d6 instead. <br> Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the jabbersnarl until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the jabbersnarl in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. 
>  
> ***Hissing Blood.*** When the jabbersnarl takes slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage, each other creature in a 10-foot emanation from the jabbersnarl is covered in acid until it or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. At the end of a creature’s turn, if it is covered in acid this way, it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.  
>  
> ***Land's Stride.*** Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs the jabbersnarl no extra movement.  
>
> ***Limited Flight.*** The jabbersnarl falls if it ends its turn in the air while nothing else is holding it aloft. It takes no fall damage from falling this way.
>
> ### Actions  
>  
> ***Multiattack.*** The jabbersnarl makes three attacks: one with its Tongue, one with its Claws, and one with its Tail.  
>  
> ***Tongue.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) poison damage. The target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 18. *Failure:* It is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the jabbersnarl.  
>  
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18) by one of the jabbersnarl’s three limbs.  
>  
> ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 32 (5d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 18. *Failure:* It is knocked prone. *Fails by 5 or more:* It can't stand up until the end of its next turn.  
>  
> ### Bonus Actions  
>  
> ***Swallow.*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 18, one Large or smaller creature grappled by the jabbersnarl (it can have up to four creatures swallowed at a time). *Failure:* The creature is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the jabbersnarl, and takes 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the jabbersnarl's turns. <Br> If the jabbersnarl takes 30 or more damage in a single turn from a creature inside, it makes a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 15. *Failure:* The jabbersnarl regurgitates all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the jabbersnarl. If the jabbersnarl dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.  

</span>

> ##### Lingering Madness
> If you wish for the jabbersnarls to have more potent effects beyond combat, you can have creatures that fail their Visage of Madness saving throw by 10 or more suffer from Indefinite Madness until dispel evil and good is cast on them.

\columnbreak

> ##### Minions of Madness
> In the standard stat block for the jabbersnarls, only enemies are affected by its Visage of Madness. However, if you wish to emphasize the jabbersnarl as a true creature of madness, you can have its allies affected as well. Depraved allies (such as Beastmen) can be somewhat tolerant of the jabbersnarl's presence—forcing them to still make the saving throw, but granting them advantage on the roll.
Allies that have already completely lost their minds (such as Spawns of Chaos) remain unaffected.

### Broodmothers & Their Spawn
Due to their twisted appearance and the maddening effect they have on the mind when observed, little is known about the jabbersnarls beyond their capacity to kill and the insanity that springs from their grotesque nature. The question of how these creatures came to be—or how they reproduce—has never been truly answered. jabbersnarls have never been found living in pairs, nor has any kind of egg or newborn ever been discovered.

Some speak of creatures referred to as "toadlets"—smaller, stunted versions of the jabbersnarl whose underdeveloped wings cannot lift them into the air—claiming these to be juvenile specimens of the species. However, the most chilling accounts come from the scattered testimonies of hunters who, after venturing into remote wilderness, returned days later in a state of incurable delirium.
Committed to asylums, these lunatics share one disturbing commonality in their wild ravings: a massive creature that spews forth writhing hordes of larvae from its porous skin—parasitic spawn that latch onto victims, feeding on their sanity. Yet, as with all things told by unhinged minds, such ghastly statements remain far from reliable, dismissed as mere delusions by most learned scholars.

> *In a lonesome hill-side, shrouded in woodland untrodden by the steps of men for untold ages, there lieth a cavern. Fain doth it hide its maw, glimpsed only through the thick-leaved bower by eyes full keen beneath the moon’s argent sheen, for by some fell decree, its yawnéd gate doth wither in the sun’s golden gleam. Shouldst thou dare to tread within that shadowed cleft, the air waxeth hot and reeketh with damp, swirling as though it were the very breath of a ravenous fiend. Were this not enough to send back any wight of sound wit, then let the walls, hewn as from wax riven by jaggéd talons, serve as harbinger of doom.*
> 
> *Yet, if these dread signs stir not thy heart to quail, and still thy feet do press onward into the bosom of the earth, a chamber shalt thou find, and therein folly’s lone guerdon. There doth crouch a misshapen bulk, its wretched limbs folded ‘neath its bulk. Eyes slit and yellow awake at thy trespass, and limbs spread wide whilst its vile flesh doth quiver and pulse like the fretful sea. From its hide burst forth foul maggots, armed with needle-rimméd maw, spilling as sweat from a plague-ridden wretch. These loathsome spawn creep nigh, gibbering as the kin of newborn horrors doth fall upon thee. If thought canst thou muster in the midst of such madness, it should be to loosen thy bow and let fly thy shafts into the maker of this accurséd brood, to dim those eyes slit and yellow that fix upon thee. Yet arrows that strike deep pierce but to wretched ends, for such wounds gape wide and vomit forth yet more of her slinking progeny.*
> 
> *Then doth the loathly thing, with eyes slit and yellow, unfurl wings vast as a ship’s sail, spanning its lair, and shake its ungodly frame, flinging its young in all wise as a tempest of noisome rain. Its foul issue o’ertaketh thee, a gaping maw fastening to thy head, feasting upon such scraps of reason as yet linger, unclaimed by those eyes, slit and yellow, that have taken so much. What then betid, I cannot tell, for I wakened upon the floor of mine own cot, leagues yonder, my flesh fouled with the filth of far wayfaring and riven with woe. How I came hither, I know not, and though time may mend my frame, the scars of my soul shall not so lightly fade. No soft bed, nor gentle touch, nor potent draught shall grant me ease. I crave only that Death may wrest from me the memory of that Broodmother, her swarming get, and those eyes, slit and yellow, that still do burn in my mind from that cavern in the lonesome hill-side, veiled by woodland untrodden by men, and that shouldst yet remain untrodden for ages uncounted.*
> 
> **-Last writing of the Huntsman Leopold Totleben before hanging himself.**

>  
> ### Actions  
>  
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The maddening larva attaches to the target and pulls itself into the target's space. While attached, the larva moves with the target, and at the end of that creature’s turn, it receives a level of delirium. For each level of delirium a creature has, it suffers a −1 penalty to Wisdom-based d20 tests. The creature loses one level of delirium every hour that passes. 
>  
> A creature can use its action to try to detach the larva and force it into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful DC 14 Strength check. On its turn, the larva can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement. When it dies, the larva detaches from any creature it is attached to.  
>  
> ***Reabsorb.*** If the maddening larva is swallowed by a jabbersnarl broodmother, it allows itself to die. Then, if the jabbersnarl broodmother is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw or check as an action or at the beginning or end of her next turn, it may immediately make that save.

### Jabbersnarl Tactics

All jabbersnarls tend to place themselves in the center of the largest horde of enemies, using their tongue to pull distant targets toward them. They prioritize attacking creatures with low Dexterity scores or those refusing to look at them.
If overwhelmed—or once they’ve gorged themselves—they may reposition, but they will never flee unless they already have a meal in tow.

#### Broodmother Tactics
The Broodmother’s larvae obey her every command instinctively. She will spread out her spaw to make sure that they are not hit by a single AOE spell and killed. Having them each go for different targets.

##### Jabbersnarl Adventure Hooks

| 1d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Screaming Fog:** A choking fog has settled on a trade route through the woods. Merchants speak of hallucinations, missing companions, and haunting screams in the mist. In truth, a jabbersnarl has made the fogbound glade its hunting ground, and its very presence twists the minds of those who enter. The players must either guide a caravan safely through or take on a bounty to clear the cursed pass.  |
|  2  | **The Beast That Ate the Cult:** A newly risen cult worshiping a chaos deity has vanished from their woodland altar. Their camp is now a gore-splattered crater. Strange claw marks and slime trails suggest they summoned something they couldn’t control. The players must piece together the ritual, learn what was brought into the world, and determine whether it can be banished—or if it’s already too late.  |
|  3  | **The Beastmen’s Bargain:** Beastmen warbands have been striking settlements with unprecedented coordination. Reports mention not just the usual braying hordes—but also something worse crashing down into the battlefield. A Bray-Speaker has learned to call down a jabbersnarl and direct it toward enemy forces. The players must break the pact or slay the speaker to stop the next town from falling into madness and ruin. |
|  4  | **The Stolen Toadling:** A group of reckless cultists has stolen an unhatched jabbersnarl spawn from a beastmen warherd. The players are hired to retrieve it—either by the cult's enemies or by the desperate cultists themselves, who didn’t realize what they were dealing with. The egg is hatching fast, and the players may soon face a ravenous, jabbersnarl toadling that’s already oozing madness. |
|  5  |  **Ravings of the Returned:** A renowned ranger stumbles back into town, bloodied and broken after a solo expedition into the wilds. His mind is shattered, and he speaks only in gibberish—until he begins screaming about a mountainous toad-beast that "bled madness" and birthed horrors from its own flesh. The players are hired to retrace his steps and uncover the truth, leading them deep into uncharted woods... where the Broodmother waits, surrounded by swarms of writhing Toadlets and parasite-larvae.  |
|  6  | **The Carnival Cradle.** A traveling freak show boasts a new “star attraction”: a caged horror they claim to be a genuine chaos beast. In truth, it’s a juvenile Toadlet spawned by a Broodmother hiding in the dark woods nearby, drawn to the sounds and smells of the traveling carnival. As the players investigate the unnatural changes among the performers and guests, the Broodmother arrives to reclaim her spawn—with an army of wriggling horrors in tow. |

### Jabbersnarl Loot
Valuable jabbersnarl loot typically comes from harvested materials and usually requires a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a **Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools)** check to gather Hide). 

Alternatively, you can roll for loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 100gp Bone item from a jabbersnarl could be a Jabbersnarl Fang, a 50gp version might be a Cracked Jabbersnarl Fang, and a 200gp version could be a Superior Jabbersnarl Fang.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.



##### Jabbersnarl Toadling Materials: 10gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Toadling Claw (Cracked/Superior) |

| 3   | Fluid|  Foul Blood (Clotted/Thick) |  
| 4  | Hide |Toadling Hide (Tattered/Tough) |

| 4  | Hide | Jabbersnarl Carapace (Tattered/Tough) |

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The **Magic Theme** column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the **Example Descriptor** suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Chaotic loot could be used to craft items that warp space or time or produce unpredictable effects.
 
***Random Magic Ingredients.***
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Jabbersnarl Magic Themes 
**Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot: 75%**
|1d4 | Magic Theme | Example Descriptor | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-4 <br>  | Chaotic (Eldritch/Realty-Warping)| Warped| 
| 4   | Primal (Druidic/Nature)  | Primeval|  

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

## Megataurs

Megataurs are colossal four-armed <br> monstrosities that tower over their <br> beastmen kin, feared and revered in equal <br> measure. These giant creatures are believed <br> to be former minotaurs who underwent extreme <br> mutations due to the overconsumption of tainted <br> flesh or other eldritch substances. This consumption <br> led to grotesque transformations, amplifying their already formidable strength and size, and giving them their terrifying new form.

Two of the megataur's arms end in massive, bone-like blades, perfect for cleaving through armor and flesh alike. The other two arms are used to grab and shovel as much flesh into their fanged maw as possible, feeding their insatiable hunger. Their monstrous form and ravenous appetite make them nearly uncontrollable, a fact that only the most powerful beastmen chieftains and shamans can overcome. Those who can control a megataur wield it as a living weapon of war, unleashing its fury upon their enemies.

In combat, megataurs are devastating forces of nature. They rush into masses of enemies with terrifying speed, bulldozing through ranks and causing chaos and panic. Their bladed arms swing with destructive force, while their other arms grab and swallow foes whole. The sight of a Megataur rampaging across the battlefield is enough to break the spirit of even the most stalwart defenders, leaving a trail of destruction and carnage in its wake. These beasts are not just instruments of war; they are the embodiment of the beastmen's endless hunger, unleashed upon the world in a frenzy of blood and violence.

***The Blood Brute.*** The Blood Brute is a particularly fearsome megataur, having received dark blessings from a demonic lord of war and bloodlust. These unholy gifts have intensified the creature's already insatiable hunger for flesh and unquenchable thirst for blood. No matter how many foes it consumes, The Blood Brute's ravenous appetite can never be sated, driving it into a perpetual frenzy. This cursed existence makes The Blood Brute an even more terrifying force on the battlefield. Its eyes burn with an unholy fire, and its roars echo with the rage of its demonic patron. The Blood Brute's presence is a harbinger of unparalleled carnage, as it rampages through enemy ranks, driven by an endless desire to feed and kill.

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
>  * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
>  * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
>  * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
>  * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.

### Megatuar Tactics
#### Combat Initiation
* Use Rushing Gore to close distance when enemies are out of reach.
* Once in melee range, target the physically strongest creature for blade arm attacks.
* Simultaneously attempt to grasp and swallow nearby, physically weaker creatures.

#### Rejuvenation Strategy
* The megataur requires creatures in its stomach to activate rejuvenation.
* If its health falls to half or less and there are no enemy creatures in its stomach or nearby, start swallowing weaker allied creatures to heal.

At the start of the creature's next turn, the target may move on its turn toward the megataur by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet of it. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal, except it can't move away from the megataur willingly and can't teleport. If it doesn't choose to move this way, it takes 27 (5d10) force damage instead.
>

### Megataur Loot
The valuable items looted from rat ogres will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Megataur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Minotaurs

Minotaurs are towering monstrosities among the beastmen, standing twice as tall as a man with bodies rippling with massive muscles and heads resembling those of fierce, fanged bulls. Their bull heads are equipped with sharp teeth, perfect for tearing at flesh and making them even more fearsome in close combat. Their sheer size and strength make them formidable foes on any battlefield, their presence alone often causing enemies to falter in fear. Though they possess immense physical power, minotaurs are known to be even less intelligent than their beastmen kin, relying on brute force and primal instincts rather than cunning or strategy.

In battle, minotaurs are driven by an insatiable hunger for flesh, with a particular preference for human flesh. This ravenous appetite fuels their ferocity, and once they taste blood, they are thrown into a wild frenzy. Their charges are devastating, capable of breaking through enemy lines and causing chaos and destruction. The sight of a blood-crazed minotaur rampaging through a battlefield is enough to turn the tide of combat in favor of the beastmen.

Minotaurs hold a special place in the dark pantheon of beastmen worship. They are often called upon by their dark gods to serve as guardians of sacred, unholy sites hidden deep underground or within the darkest parts of the woods. These sites are often maze-like, labyrinthine structures created through the twisted influence of the dark gods. Minotaurs navigate these unholy labyrinths with unnatural ease, hunting down intruders with relentless determination. 

Despite the fear they inspire, powerful beastmen leaders will summon minotaurs to join them in battle, luring them with promises of fresh meat and the chance to sate their bloodlust. Other beastmen tread carefully around these hulking brutes, aware of their unpredictable nature and the devastation they can unleash.


Minotaurs who frequently participate in the wars of the beastmen and have gorged on the flesh of countless enemies become more powerful and are referred to as Flesh Gorgers. These monstrous brutes grow even larger and more muscled, their already formidable strength becoming even more devastating. Their fanged bull heads become more menacing, with teeth stained from the blood of their countless victims. The insatiable hunger that drives them intensifies, turning them into relentless engines of destruction on the battlefield. Flesh Gorgers are feared by both enemies and their fellow beastmen, their bloodlust and ferocity making them nearly unstoppable forces of nature. Their presence in a battle often signals an impending massacre, as they tear through foes with terrifying ease, leaving carnage in their wake.

The Butchers are a notorious group of minotaurs, renowned for their unparalleled brutality and efficiency in combat. Each member of this dreaded band wields a massive meat cleaver, a weapon perfectly suited to their immense strength and savage nature. These cleavers are capable of hewing through flesh, bone, and armor with horrifying ease. When the Butchers charge into battle, their cleavers flash through the air, leaving a trail of blood and dismembered bodies in their wake. Their brutal fighting style and sheer ferocity ensure that few can stand against them for long.

Unlike other minotaurs driven by the immediate need to sate their hunger, the Butchers are known for slaughtering far more foes than they can devour at one time. Entire villages fall to their rampages, leaving behind a grisly tableau of carnage. The Butchers string up the remaining corpses, leaving them to rot as a grim warning to others and as a gruesome larder they can return to whenever they please. These horrific displays serve both as a deterrent to would-be challengers and as a testament to their savage dominance. The Butchers' reign of terror spreads fear far and wide, with their name becoming synonymous with relentless slaughter and unending horror. The sight of their macabre handiwork marks the territory of the Butchers, reminding all who see it of the monstrous appetites and barbaric cruelty that define these fearsome minotaurs.

#### Minotaur Commanders


Minotaur commanders, known as Warbulls, are seasoned veterans blessed by the dark gods, their strength and resilience elevated to supernatural levels. These commanders become engines of brutal destruction, their colossal forms and overwhelming power making them effective leaders despite their limited intelligence. The greatest among them, the Doombulls, are towering figures of unrelenting wrath and devastating might. Revered and feared, Doombulls inspire a frenzied bloodlust in their followers, driving them to fight with reckless abandon and brutal efficiency. Their formidable presence alone can turn the tide of battle, as their followers are Emboldened by the sheer power and ferocity they witness.

Both Warbulls and Doombulls lead through raw power and presence, often commanding from the front lines where their followers can see their unmatched might firsthand. Their roars and bellows incite their beastmen hordes to unparalleled ferocity, turning warbands into unstoppable tides of destruction. While lacking in subtlety and strategic cunning, their straightforward approach of overwhelming force is brutally effective. The sight of a Doombull leading a charge signals the arrival of chaos and carnage on an unprecedented scale, striking fear into the hearts of even the most seasoned warriors. These commanders rely not on complex strategies but on their ability to inspire terror and bloodlust, ensuring that their armies fight with the same relentless savagery that defines them.

* Can charge at two different targets if able.
* While under the effects of Blood Greed, prefers two Hewing Greataxe attacks for increased damage.
* Uses Slaughterer’s Call before combat to rally minotaurs and gain tactical advantage.

#### Doombull
* Begins combat by charging to knock a target prone.
* Follows up with Barbed Fist to inflict wounds that can be exploited by fellow minotaurs.
* Coordinates attacks to keep the target prone, maximizing damage with Hewing Greataxe.
* Prioritizes reapplying wounds to maintain tactical advantage if the target recovers.

### Minotaur Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from minotaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Minotaur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Morghul
*Eternal Avatar of Corruption*<br>
**Habitat:** Any except Underwater & Urban; **Treasure:** Any <br>
When the Sun goeth down and hideth its face beneath the edge of the world, and only the small stars remain to watch the turning Earth, and the little fires of men flicker in scattered towns and villages—then is the hour when the Watch is kept. Soldiers and Guards stand upon the old walls and in the old towers, their eyes turned to the dark places, watching for that which moveth under cover of night and cometh not with invitation, bringing sorrow and fear in its wake.
And as they watch, they speak low among themselves, telling dark tales not to comfort, but to sharpen the soul with fear, that weariness may not close the eye, nor dreams lull the vigilant.

They speak of a creature that rose alone from the blackened marshes, and wandered the wide Earth, coming at last to the gates of the cities of men. There it stood and called for kings, wishing only to bestow its gifts. What those gifts were, none now dare say—but those kings who took them wailed horribly and fled into the wilderness, as their cities toppled and burned.
They speak also of the thing that climbeth the mountain slopes in the hours when the Moon hideth her face. It is not alone, for behind it go the malformed—things of twisted limb and broken shape, who cry out for others yet dwelling upon the mountain, those who found no refuge in the ancient halls carved into stone. And the malformed call to them, saying: Come, be as we are. Join the parade of hatred and of grief.

They speak, too, of a village that was swallowed by a malicious wood. If one enter into the heart of that place, they shall find rusted gates, and buildings distorted and bent. And at their base crawl men and women upon all fours, hoofed and clawed, snarling like beasts. And within the shattered homes walk creatures upon two legs, clad in the tatters of human garb, speaking in tongues unknown—barking and hissing in a language that may not be broken.

In the center of that accursèd place groweth a tree, and it thrashèth and writhes like a beast snared in iron. Beneath its roots lieth a cave, and the walls thereof are of glass that floweth like the sea in storm. And within—He who is master of torment and of chaos. His desires are caught in the glass and move upon its surface, unspoken and undying.
Yet the Watchers know not that all these things, and more besides, are but the workings of one and the same. A spirit vile, who went forth upon the land ere the world was given its names. Since that time it hath crept and stalked and slithered in manifold forms, each more loathsome than the last. Wherever it goeth, there spring up mutability and madness, and chaos bloometh in its wake.
Other terrible beasts seek out the Thing of Old, that they might be given bodies of dreadful might. Their forms are shaped by the churning Chaos that eternally followeth the One who hath worn so many guises.

It seeketh not dominion, nor worship. It seeketh only that Order shall be unmade and forgotten.

### Morghul's Lair
Wherever Morghul makes his lair, the world around him twists like clay in the hands of a mad sculptor. Stone flows like water, reshaping itself into horrid architecture; trees contort into impossible forms as their bark peels away to reveal skin beneath. All manner of misbegotten creatures circle his domain—drawn to this locus of chaos, hoping to be reborn in the presence of the Lord of Mutations.


When fighting within his lair, the Morghul's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 1.  

#### Lair Actions  

On initiative count 1 (losing initiative ties), the lair chooses two unoccupied spaces at the edge of its boundaries. A Wicked Beast (stat block on the page after next) appears in each space and remains until destroyed. They act on initiative count 0 (losing initiative ties).

#### Regional Effects  

The presence of Morghul has a drastic impact on his surroundings, spreading corruption within a 10-mile radius of his lair that causes the following effects:

* Any creature in the area that ends its turn with three or more mutations gains a random deformity from the Deformities Table below. A creature cannot gain another deformity this way for 1 minute.

* Any creature that finishes a long rest within the area must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or gain a random deformity from the Deformities Table below.

These deformities persist until the *greater restoration* or *heal* spell is cast on the affected creature. However, you may choose to make the removal of deformities more difficult—turning them into a long-term plot hook or quest. Below are example methods for removing them:

##### Removing Deformaties

| 1d4 |  Example     |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1  | **The Sculptor Witch.** Tales speak of a strange witch who is both young and old. She works with white clay that she shapes into perfect likenesses of those who visit her. Any who gaze upon their statue may transfer a deformity into the sculpture—forever trapped in hardened clay. |
|  2  | **The Spring of Silence.** Deep within a gloom-stricken forest overrun by the restless dead lies a sacred spring. Its waters remain untouched by decay, an oasis that the cursed creatures of the wood dare not enter. Any who are baptized in its pure, silver waters are cleansed of their deformities. |
|  3  | **The Feast Below.** In the ruins of an abandoned village lies a cellar leading to vast catacombs, warmly lit and filled with unspoiled wine and impossible feasts. Gold lines the walls, and silken drapes hang. Here dwell radiant and alruing demons (Mariliths) who offer to remove any deformity with a single touch. But they will not stop at peeling away your deformities.

|  |       |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  4  | **The Moonbound Procession.** A procession of deformed spirits walks the world in mourning, visible only by the full moon’s light. Those who can predict their path and walk beside them from dusk to dawn will find a new spirit joins their ranks by morning with thier deformations transfer upon it.

<Br>

##### Deformities Table

|1d20 |        |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1  | One massive, goat-like eye sits in the center of your forehead. |
|  2  | A mane of thick, oily hair grows down your spine that stands on end when you are angry. |
|  3  | Malformed, asymmetrical horns jut from your skull at odd angles. |
|  4  | Your face resembles a twisted beast’s muzzle. |
|  5  | Your legs bend like a goat’s, ending in cracked, blackened hooves. |
|  6  | Your skin is thick, leathery, and covered in patches of dark scales. |
|  7  | A second mouth sits sideways across your throat. It opens when you're angry or excited. |
|  8  | Your fingers are overly long, with too many joints, ending in sharp nails. |
|  9  |  A useless third arm hangs limp and spasming every now and then. |
| 10  | Your mouth is filled with rows of mismatched teeth that slowly fall out and regrow over time. |
| 11  | Your facial skin sheds daily like a snake’s molting. |
| 12  | Thin spines grow along your limbs, twitching when touched. |
| 13  | Small, insectile wings sprout from your back, flapping ineffectively. |
| 13  | Two tails drag behind you—one forked, the other bristled like a bottlebrush.. |
| 14  | Your tongue is thick, forked, and moves independently, tasting the air like a serpent. |
| 15  | One side of your body is covered in feathers that shift colors rapidly. |
| 16  | Tiny branches with Small blood-red leaves cover your body. |
| 17  | Twitching antennae grow from your skull. |
| 18  | You sweat rainbow ichor, staining clothes and leaving a sickly sweet scent. . |
| 19  | Your flesh become trasnluents allowing your orgains and bones to be seen. |
| 20  | Strange runes are carved into your flesh, writhing and shifting across your body. |

> ### Traits
>
> ***Adaptive Morphing.*** When Morghul fails a saving throw that required his action to make or when he fails a saving throw at the beginning or end of a turn, he can choose to succeed instead and takes force damage equal to 2d10 + the amount by which he failed the save.
>
> ***Aura of Transmutation.*** Morghul emits an aura in a 30‑foot emanation from himself. Any ranged attack that travels 15 feet or more through the emanation automatically misses. Spells and other magical effects can't extend into or out of the emanation. Each creature that ends its turn in the aura must make a *Charisma saving throw:* DC 15. <br> *Failure:* The creature suffers a random mutation from the Mutation Table on the page after next (*Mutation Save DC 15*). On a failure of 5 or more, it gains two mutations; by 10 or more, it gains three mutations.
>
> ***Demonic Restoration.*** If Morghul dies, he returns to life in 4d4 × 10 years and regains all his hit points.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Writhing Attack.*** Morghul performs two of the following actions at random. He can take these actions at any point during his turn, in any order:
> - **1. Shredding Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) slashing damage. If this attack scores a critical hit, it deals an extra 10 (3d6) slashing damage.
> - **2. Erupting Flames.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) fire damage. If the target is a creature or flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.
> - **3. Morbid Strike.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, and the target can’t regain hit points until the start of Morghul’s next turn.
> - **4. Shadow Spear.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) cold damage, and the target can’t see more than 5 feet until the start of Morghul’s next turn.
> - **5. Slimy Tendril.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) poison damage, and the target is pulled 30 feet toward Morghul.
> - **6. Destabilizing Touch.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) force damage, and the target has disadvantage on its next saving throw against Morghul’s Aura of Transmutation.
>
> ### Essence of Chaos
>
> When Morghul rolls initiative, he calls upon the Dark Powers to warp the world around him. For 1 minute—or until Morghul dies—the Dark Powers (Intelligence 16) act in his best interest. On initiative count 20 (losing ties),  one of the following effects is selected at random, and the powers then choose a point within 60 feet of Morghul; the effect occurs in a 15‑foot cube centered on that point:
>
> - **1. Booming Roar.** *Constitution saving throw:* DC 18, each creature in the area. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is sheathed in booming energy until initiative count 20 on the next round. If it willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, it takes 13 (3d8) thunder damage and the effect ends. <br>*Success:* Half damage.
> - **2. Snaring Vines.** *Dexterity or Strength saving throw (target’s choice): DC 18,* each creature in the area. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and is restrained by vines until they are destroyed (AC 15; 30 HP; vulnerable to slashing). <Br> *Success:* Half damage.
> - **3. Distorted Space.** *Charisma saving throw: DC 18,* each creature in the area. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 18 (4d8) force damage and is teleported to an unoccupied space of the Dark Powers’ choice within the cube that it can see. The chosen space must support the creature without squeezing.
> - **4. Spreading Nightmares.** *Wisdom saving throw: DC 18,* each creature in the area. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage and becomes frightened until initiative count 20 of the next round. <br> *Success:* Half damage. When the fear ends (even early), each other creature within 10 feet of the affected creature (excluding Morghul) takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage.

### Epic Battle: Unbound Abomination
If you wish to make Morghul into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 594 hit points, and give him the Unbound Abomination ability. This increases his CR to 21.

***Unbound Abomination (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).***  If Morghul is reduced to half his hit points (297 or less), he may end any effects incapacitating, and he chooses two unoccupied spaces within 15 feet, causing a thing of chaos (stat block on the previous page,) to appear in each space. They act on their own turns On initiative count 0 (losing initiative ties). 

Additionally, for the next hour, Morghul's size becomes Large, and when he uses his Writhing Attack action, he can now perform three attacks instead of two.

### Mutations
Whenever an effect calls for mutating a creature, choose one of the effects from the table below at random.
##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|

### Sealing the Spirit of Chaos

Morghul is an eternal spirit of chaos—death is merely a delay to his return. However, if you wish to give your players a way to end Morghul’s cycle of rebirth once and for all, consider using one of the following methods:

| Method  | Description | Outcome
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  The Tome of Final Binding  | A blank tome with ever-hungry pages can trap Morghul if a prophet of great power records his wicked deeds within.       |  Morghul is sealed inside the tome. If the book is destroyed or read aloud, he is released.   |
|  The Grove of Reckoning  | If defeated in a sacred grove blessed by archfey, Morghul’s power can be drained and consumed by these ancient beings.       | Morghul is prevented from returning. However, the consequences of the archfey absorbing his chaotic essence are unknown.      | 
|  The Mirror of Dread Reflection  | A legendary mirror reacts to Morghul’s reflection, becoming a portal to a nightmare realm shaped by his hatred.       | If Morghul is forced through the mirror and it is shattered, he is trapped in a prison of his own making.      |
|  The Shattered Name  | Morghul’s true name was shattered and scattered across the world, embedded in beasts, trees, and relics.      | If all fragments are gathered and his true name restored, Morghul assumes a final, nightmarish form—one that can be permanently destroyed.      |

### Morghul's Tactics
Morghul's attacks are determined randomly, but he applies a strategy based on the mutations of his targets. Each attack favors specific conditions or mutations.

#### Writhing Attacks
* **Shredding Claw.** Targets a creature with the Degeneration mutation.
* **Erupting Flames.** Targets a creature with the Wild Spasms mutation, or those not adjacent to any allies.
* **Morbid Strike.** Targets creatures with the Regeneration mutation.
* **Shadow Spear.** Targets ranged creatures.
* **Slimy Tendrils.** Targets ranged creatures or those with the Gelatinous Legs or Inverted Eyes mutations.
* **Destabilizing Touch.** Targets creatures with low Charisma, or those with Gelatinous Legs or Inverted Eyes.

#### Essence of Chaos
This ability always targets the largest group of creatures. If multiple groups have the same number of targets, the Dark Powers choose based on which mutations they can exploit:

* **Booming Roar.** Targets the group with the fewest mutations.
* **Snaring Vines.** Targets creatures with Twisted Arms and Wild Spasms.
* **Distorted Space.** Targets creatures with Gelatinous Legs.
* **Spreading Nightmares.** Also targets creatures with Gelatinous Legs.

#### Lair Effects
* Wicked Beasts created by the lair attack creatures they have advantage against.
* Once a Wicked Beast transforms into a Thing of Chaos, it uses the same targeting logic as Morghul to determine its attacks.

### Morghul's Loot
Valuable loot dropped by Morghul typically comes from harvested materials found amongst his deformed remains and usually requires a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a **Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools)** check to gather Hide). 

##### Morghul Loot (Avg. 1,800gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Items (500gp) |
|  10-14 | 1 1,000gp Item (1,000gp) | 
|  15-21 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items (2,000gp) |  
|  22-25 | 1 2,000gp Items (2,000gp)  |  
|  26+ |  1d4(2) 2,000gp Items (4,000gp) |  

\columnbreak

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 1,000gp Bone item from Morghul could be Morghul's Horn, a 500gp version might be a Morghul's Cracked Horn, and a 2,000gp version could be a Morghul's Prime Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.



##### Morghul Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d6 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|  Morghul's Horn (Cracked/Prime) | 
| 2   | Cloth | Morghul's Cowl (Tattered/Prime)|  
| 3   | Hide | Morghul's Hide (Tattered/Prime)|  
| 4   | Flesh |  Morghul's Flesh (Stringy/Prime) |  
| 5  | Fluid |Morghul's Blood (Diluted/Prime) | 
| 6  | Wood |Morghul's Totem Scraps (Damaged/Prime) | 

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting

If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In Morghul's case, Chaos effects would make the most sense. These would be magic item effects that warp reality or induce mutations or madness in their targets.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

## Spawns of Chaos
*Mutant Abominations Warped By The Power of Chaos*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** None <br>
Over untold ages, as chaotic realms have breached  <br> mortal plane, these incursions have birthed a plethora of abominations, their malign influence twisting all caught in their path. Some creatures, bathed in mutating energies, become beings that defy all logic and order. These nightmarish anomalies are broadly known as spawns of chaos.

These cosmic mockeries arise in myriad ways—perhaps a warrior of the Dark Gods is bestowed with too many "blessings" from their fickle patron, warping their body beyond recognition. Or a sorcerer foolishly channels raw power from the distant realms, their body and mind fracturing under the strain of such immense magic. Others undergo this cruel metamorphosis merely by standing in the presence of a virulent monument or a great herald of the Ruinous Gods.

Though the means of a spawn’s creation are countless, their forms and abilities are infinite. Some are grotesque amalgamations of limbs from men and beasts, fused into a disorienting and horrifying jumble. Others bear the heads of massive insects, cloaked in coarse, woolly hair, crowned with stag-like antlers or sharp beaks that part to reveal rows of human teeth. Some possess powerful equine limbs that end in fleshy, flowering patterns of fingers, each tipped with a wicked stinger.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Others are even more bizarre—composed almost entirely of raw, corded muscle, riddled with jagged bony protrusions and snapping jaws strewn haphazardly across their hulking figures. Some are little more than writhing masses of snake-like tendrils, their soft, silken skin crisscrossing as they release strange, intoxicating scents and sounds that enrapture those unfortunate enough to encounter them.

More grotesque still are those whose bloated forms are covered in shifting tumors and sores, rupturing under their own strain to release all manner of putrid mucus. Most bizarre of all, however, are those whose unstable forms are not composed of any organic material—lumps of flowing metal or wax, their ever-shifting surfaces revealing fleeting visages that scream, letting loose gouts of colorful flames and light before melting back into the mass.

Whatever monstrous configuration these epitomes of discord take, they all share an inherent instability in their existence. All spawns of chaos are erratic and violent, destroying anything their impulsive whims lead them to. Ultimately, all are doomed—either to die in conflict or to be torn apart by the very energies that birthed them.

##### Spawn of Chaos Adventure Hooks

| 1d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Mutating Ruins:** An ancient ruin, long sealed away, has begun to leak strange, reality-warping energy. Locals whisper of travelers who entered and emerged twisted beyond recognition, or worse, never returned at all. The players are sent to investigate and navigate a crumbling labyrinth where the walls pulse with unnatural life and spawns of chaos formed from the fused bodies of previous explorers lurk.  |
|  2  | **The Cursed Champion:** A mighty warrior devoted to the Dark Gods has been "blessed" too many times, their body grotesquely twisted into a monstrous Spawn of Chaos. However, their former warband refuses to let them die, instead worshiping them as a divine avatar. The players must infiltrate this zealous warband, fight through hordes of fanatics, and put down the rampaging spawn before its mutations spread further. |
|  3  | **The Flesh Hive:** A once-thriving town has become eerily silent, its streets overgrown with strange, pulsating growths. Those who enter are greeted by whispers in the walls, disjointed limbs sprouting from cobblestone, and flesh melding into wood and iron. The town’s people have been consumed, fused together into a colossal Spawn of Chaos, which now writhes beneath the town square, birthing lesser horrors that crawl through the ruins. |


\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

|  | |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  4  | **The Eldritch Caravan:** A traveling merchant caravan arrives in town, selling rare and exotic wares. However, strange occurrences begin—shadows stretch in the wrong direction, people wake up changed, and some disappear entirely. The caravan’s leader has unknowingly acquired a relic that is birthing Spawns of Chaos in the night, twisting both people and objects into abominations. The players must investigate before the town is lost to corruption. |
|  5  | **The Tower of Madness:** An abandoned wizard’s tower has become a beacon of chaos, warping the landscape around it. Inside, space folds in on itself, corridors loop endlessly, and doors lead to nowhere. The wizard, long since consumed by their own experiments, has transformed into a monstrous Spawn of Chaos, their body fusing with their spellbooks and laboratory equipment, turning the tower into a living nightmare.  |
|  6  | **The Living Battlefield:** A war long ago was fought on cursed ground, and now, the battlefield itself refuses to rest. The bodies of the dead have merged into a horrific Spawn of Chaos, a lumbering mass of bone, armor, and flesh that shifts unpredictably. The players must destroy it before it awakens fully, lest it rampage across the land, absorbing everything in its path. |

### Lesser Spawn of Chaos Alternative Writhing Attack Tables

The following are additional action sets for the spawn's Writhing Attack, which can be used instead of its normal set. Each set is organized thematically, but feel free to mix and match to create your own table of six.

While wounded, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution d20 Tests, and its speed is halved.

| 2 | **Bone Spike** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 10 (3d6) piercing damage. If the spawn moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before this hit and the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the spike and becomes grappled (escape DC 13). While grappled, the target is restrained and takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage at the start of each of the spawn’s turns. |
| 3 | **War Stomp** | *Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw (target’s choice):* DC 13, each other creature in a 10-foot emanation from the spawn. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared. *Failure:* The creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. |
| 4 | **Flesh Feast** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 10 (3d6) piercing damage, and the spawn regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. |
| 5 | **Blood Disgorge** | *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 13 each creature in a 30-foot cone. *Failure:* The creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and can’t regain hit points until the start of the spawn’s next turn. *Success:* Half damage only |
| 6 | **Murderous Fit** | The spawn’s speed increases by 20 feet until the end of its turn, and it can make up to three attacks. Each attack must be against a different target. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. |

| 2 | **Warping Breath** | *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 13, each creature in a 30-foot cone. *Failure:* A creature takes 7 (2d6) force damage and is teleported to an unoccupied space of the spawn’s choice that it can see within the cone’s area. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without it having to squeeze. *Success:* Half damage only. |
| 3 | **Molten Liquids** | *Ranged or Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., *Hit:* 17 (5d6) fire damage. |

| 5 | **Unstable Field** | The spawn gains 15 temporary hit points until the start of its next turn. If a creature damages the spawn with an attack while within 30 feet of it and the spawn still has these temporary hit points, the attacker takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage. |
| 6 | **Disruptive Slam** | *Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is sheathed in chaotic energy until the start of the spawn’s next turn. If the target casts a spell before then, it takes 14 (4d6) force damage, and the effect ends. |

While infested, the target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. Any creature within reach can use an action to make a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check to remove the insects using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, causing 1d6 damage of the same type to the target on a success (the effect then ends). A creature can choose to make the check more aggressively, gaining advantage, but if it does, the target instead takes 2d6 damage. |

### Spawn of Chaos Alternative Writhing Attack Tables

The following are additional action sets for the spawn's Writhing Attack, which can be used instead of its normal set. Each set is organized thematically, but feel free to mix and match to create your own table of six.


##### Chaos Spawn of Rage Table
| 1d6  | Actions | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|:-----------|
| 1 | **Mangling Talons** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 22 (4d10) slashing damage, and the target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 13. *Failure:* The target suffers a rending wound. While wounded, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution d20 Tests, and its speed is halved. The wound ends if the creature regains 15 or more hit points at once, or if the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to stanch the wound by succeeding on a Wisdom (Medicine) check: DC 15.|
| 2 | **Bone Spike** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage. If the spawn moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before this hit and the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the spike and becomes grappled (escape DC 15). While grappled, the target is restrained and takes 5 (1d10) piercing damage at the start of each of the Chaos Spawn’s turns. |
| 3 | **War Stomp** | *Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw (target’s choice):* DC 15, each other creature in a 10-foot emanation from the spawn. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared. *Failure:* A creature takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. |
| 4 | **Flesh Feast** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage, and the spawn regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. |
| 5 | **Blood Disgorge** | *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 15, each creature in a 30-foot cone. *Failure:* 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and the creature can't regain hit points until the start of the spawn’s next turn. *Success:* Half damage only. |
| 6 | **Murderous Fit** | The spawn’s speed increases by 20 feet until the end of its turn, and it may make up to three attacks. Each attack must be against a different target. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage. |

| 5 | **Unstable Field** | The spawn gains 20 temporary hit points until the start of its next turn. If a creature damages the spawn with an attack while within 30 feet of it and the spawn still has these temporary hit points, the attacker takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage. |
| 6 | **Disruptive Slam** | *Melee Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage, and the target is sheathed in chaotic energy until the start of the spawn’s next turn. If the target casts a spell before then, it takes 22 (4d10) force damage and the effect ends. |

On a success, the effect ends. A creature can choose to make the check more aggressively, gaining advantage, but if it does, the target instead takes 2d10 damage. |

### Spawn of Chaos Loot
Valuable spawn of chaos loot typically comes from harvested materials and usually requires a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a **Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools)** check to gather Hide). 

Alternatively, you can roll for loot randomly using a flat modifier.

##### Lesser Spawn of Chaos Loot (Avg. 27gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | 1d4(2) 5gp Item (10gp) |
|  6-8 | 1d6(3) 5gp Items (15gp) | 
|  9-16 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items (20gp) |  
|  17-21 | 1d4(2) 20gp Items (40gp)  |  
|  22+ |  1d6(3) 20gp Items (60gp) |  

##### Spawn of Chaos Loot (Avg. 85gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1d12(6) 5gp Item (30gp) |

|  11-18 | 1d12(6) 10gp Items (60gp) |  
|  19-22 | 1d12(6) 20gp Items (60gp)  |  
|  23+ |  2d8(9) 20gp Items (90gp) |  

##### Giant Spawn of Chaos Loot (Avg. 1,100gp)

|  8-14 | 2d12(13) 50gp Items (650gp) | 
|  15-21 | 2d10(11) 100gp Items (1,100gp) |  
|  22-25 | 2d12(13) 100gp Items (1,300gp)  |  
|  26+ |  2d12(13) 200gp Items (2,600gp) |  

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Bone item from a spawn could be a Twisted Claw, a 5gp version might be a Cracked Twisted Claw, and a 20gp version could be a Superior Twisted Claw.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

\columnbreak

##### Spawn of Chaos Materials: 10gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Twisted Claw (Cracked/Superior) | 
| 2   | Flesh | Mutated Tongue (Shrunken/Enhanced)|

| 3   | Fluid| Giant Spawn Blood (Clotted/Thick) |  
| 4  | Hide | Giant Spawn Skin (Tattered/Tough) |  


#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The **Magic Theme** column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the **Example Descriptor** suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Chaotic loot could be used to craft items that warp space or time or produce unpredictable effects.
 
***Random Magic Ingredients.***
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Spawn of Chaos Magic Themes 
**Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot: 80%**
|1d4 | Magic Theme | Example Descriptor | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-2 <br>  | Chaotic (Eldritch/Realty-Warping)| Chaos-Infused| 
| 3-4   | Fiendish  | Demonic|  

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

## Stoneheart

Stoneheart was once a powerful warlord <br> commanding a formidable beastman tribe, known <br> for his brutal strength and unwavering dominance. His reign was challenged when a cunning bray speaker attempted to seize control of the tribe by possessing Stoneheart’s body, intending to use the mighty minotaur as a puppet to command the tribe. However, Stoneheart’s will proved to be extraordinarily powerful. In a remarkable feat of mental fortitude, he managed to wrest control of his body long enough to exact vengeance on the shaman’s physical form, which lay vulnerable and defenseless in a trance.

After Stoneheart destroyed the shaman's body, the shaman’s spirit became trapped within him. This left the two entities locked in a constant battle for control. When Stoneheart is in control, he behaves and fights like a typical minotaur doombull, exuding raw power and engaging in relentless, brutal combat. However, when the shaman’s spirit gains the upper hand, Stoneheart’s capabilities change dramatically. Under the shaman’s influence, he gains access to mystic powers, allowing him to wield dark magic and curses far beyond the reach of ordinary minotaurs.

This duality makes Stoneheart a fearsome and unpredictable foe. The shaman’s spirit grants him a level of cunning and strategic thinking that is unheard of among minotaurs, making him a dangerous opponent on and off the battlefield. However, the constant internal struggle between the two spirits also renders him prone to erratic and unpredictable behavior. Allies and enemies alike are never certain which aspect of Stoneheart they will face: the unyielding brute force of the doombull or the dark, cunning sorcery of the trapped shaman. This internal conflict drives Stoneheart’s actions, making him one of the most formidable and enigmatic figures among the beastmen.

### Epic Battle: Dual Souls

For an epic encounter with Stoneheart, give the Bray Speaker spirit possessing him its own pool of 310 hit points, which it regains after a short or long rest. 

Whenever Stoneheart takes damage while possessed, the damage is instead dealt to the Bray Speaker. If this damage reduces the Bray Speaker to 0 hit points, Stoneheart takes the remaining damage and loses the Possessed trait. Conversely, if Stoneheart is reduced to 0 hit points, the Bray Speaker takes the remaining damage. In this case, the Stoneheart automatically becomes possessed, losing the ability to make saving throws to end the possession.

Stoneheart only dies if both he and the Bray Speaker are reduced to 0 hit points.

For this encounter, increase Stoneheart's challenge rating (CR) to 22.

### Stoneheart Tactics

#### Not Possessed
* Engages primarily in melee combat.
* **Typical Attack Sequence:** 
    * Gores a target, follows with a strike from his Hewing Greataxe.
    * If movement permits, may gore two different targets.
    * Against aerial opponents, uses Wing Puncturing Javelin.
* Utilizes legendary actions to maximize movement and damage output.



#### Possessed

* Shifts to a spellcasting role, focusing on area control and debuffs.
* Maintains distance from opponents
* Starts turns by maximizing Corrupting Influence effects, targeting multiple opponents with spells.
* **Sequence in combat:**
    * Casts a spell
    * Follows up with Hewing Greataxe for close <Br> targets, or Atrophy Blot for ranged attacks.
    * Uses legendary actions  for Dark Surge to <br> maintain battlefield control.

### Stoneheart Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from minotaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Stoneheart Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

#### Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

#### Emboldened 
The creature is momentarily filled with boisterous confidence, causing it to deal an additional 7 (2d6) damage when it hits with an attack. This condition lasts up to 1 minute. The condition ends early if, at the end of the creature's turn, it missed with all its attacks that turn, it is Charmed or Frightened, or it is under the effects of the *calm emotions* spell.

#### Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|

#### Quickened
A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.
