# Beastmen Compendium


In the shadowed depths of ancient forests, where sunlight scarcely penetrates the dense canopy, the beastmen thrive. These vile humanoids are a grotesque blend of goat and man, embodying the primal savagery of the animal kingdom and the cunning malevolence of humanity. Their twisted forms are a mockery of the human shape, with gnarled horns, coarse fur, and bestial visages that inspire fear and revulsion.

The beastmen harbor a deep-seated loathing for civilization and its creations. They view the structured order of cities and towns as an affront to their chaotic nature, and they take perverse pleasure in despoiling the works of more civilized races. This hatred is not just ideological but also deeply instinctual, driving them to relentless acts of destruction and desecration.

Their abode is the untamed wilderness of the dark forests, a labyrinthine world of shadows and danger. In these murky realms, the beastmen are not alone; they often form uneasy alliances with other destructive monsters and malevolent entities that share their disdain for order and harmony. These dark alliances make the heart of the forests a place of nightmares, where few dare to tread.

\columnbreak

The society of the beastmen is characterized by rowdiness, impulsiveness, and a lack of any refined culture. They live for the thrill of the hunt, the joy of battle, and the ecstasy of indulgence in their base desires. Their communities are driven by a brutal hierarchy where strength and savagery are the only currencies of respect. Hedonism and bloodlust are not just common but celebrated, and their rituals and celebrations are debauched affairs that often end in violence or worse.

Despite their apparent lack of sophistication, the beastmen are not to be underestimated. They possess a cunning and a knowledge of their woodland domains that make them formidable adversaries. Their raids are swift and brutal, striking like a tempest and leaving behind only ruin and despair. In the world of shadows where they dwell, the beastmen reign supreme, a constant reminder of the dark and wild forces that lurk just beyond the boundaries of the civilized world.

This document provides content to help you run games that heavily feature the beastmen or any of the savage creatures that dwell in their forest domain. This content ranges from new spells used by the beastmen to a bestiary of the different types of beastmen and the monsters they utilize. Whether the players only have a minor side quest featuring beastmen or an entire campaign, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

# Running Beastmen Adventures 

The setting you're running your adventures in will help determine the origin of the beastmen and how they fit into your world. They may be irredeemably evil monsters who serve dark gods and seek the downfall of civilization. They may have once been rowdy, uncouth humans who succumbed to their wild impulses and were cursed with bestial forms. Or, they may be a savage but misunderstood race of forest dwellers the players are able to reason with.

Regardless of their origins, there are some common traits that define the beastmen and the creatures they ally with:

* **Driven By Base Urges:** All humans experience primal drives that push them towards violence or hedonism and must be controlled through discipline and civility. Beastmen lack and actively despise such forces of restraint and wholly give themselves to their debauched urges. They are wild and undisciplined in combat and prone to extreme and destructive revelry whenever given the chance. This makes them aggressive and unpredictable enemies but also limits their ability to organize and build anything of value.

* **Loathing of Civilization:** Beastmen lack the ability to create any civilization's marvelous works, and in turn, they hate all such creations. The creations of civilization allow softer, weaker humanoids to hold them at bay, and as such, beastmen seek to tear down civilization in all its forms so the playing field can be tipped in their favor. While beastmen will readily plunder the works of civilization for their own use, they will never put any effort into maintaining anything they've taken.

* **Might Makes Right:** Beastmen society is as uncivilized as one could imagine, and status within their clans is generally determined by strength and intimidation (though some cunning beastmen can rise in power through other means). The leaders of beastmen control their forces using such means and must always be ready to put down challengers while trying to maintain some form of cohesion among their wild and rowdy kin.

\columnbreak

### Beastmen Motivations
Most beastmen have simple motivations driven by base impulses that rarely stretch far into the future. They seek to gratify their animalistic urges which tend to include violence and destruction. They also seek to rise in status among their clan whenever possible, asserting dominance over others whenever the opportunity presents itself.

Leaders among the beastmen may have longer-term goals that involve bringing about the downfall of towns, cities, or even whole kingdoms. They find ways to tactically channel the destructive capabilities of their tribe to maximum effect, allowing them to pursue larger and grander acts of destruction.

When role-playing beastmen, don't overthink them. They are usually at the mercy of their destructive impulses and will pursue whatever is most likely to bring them immediate gratification. However, they are not mindless, and many still possess a low cunning, allowing them to plot ways to achieve their goals. They also possess a strong sense of self-preservation, which is often at odds with their impulsive nature. Beastmen can very quickly flip from wild abandon to panicked cowardess.

#### Common Beastmen Motivations
* Destroy Edifice of Civilization (Town, City, Caravan, Etc.)
* Indulge in Violence or Hedonism
* Gain Status in Clan
* Exact Vengeance on Enemy
* Appease Primal Gods
* Secure Forest Territory

### Tactics of the Beastmen Forces
The combat tactics used by the different types of beastmen are described along with each individual creature's description later in this document. When beastmen forces come together to form large war herds, they are able to operate with a level of coordination that belies their savage and impulsive nature. Though they aren't known for their intelligence, beastmen can employ tactics that resemble a cross between those used by a pack of predatory beasts and a gang of malicious bullies. They can work together to bring down powerful targets but get malicious glee when mobbing vulnerable victims.

Beastmen prefer rapid surprise attacks, relying on wild, savage, bravado, and bloodlust to immediately put their foes on the back foot. So long as they are pressing their advantage, the beastmen can rely on savage aggression to compensate for their lack of organization. However, if the tables turn on them, the craven and undisciplined nature of the beastmen causes their fighting force to quickly begin losing cohesion as tactics fall apart and many begin to flee. Only a beastman force led by a powerful leader can maintain its integrity in the face of such adversity.

# New Spells

## Lore of Beasts
This brand of magic draws on the power of the wilds and the animals that inhabit them. Those who practice it avoid civilization and live hermitic lives in the savage and untamed wilderness. Their magic harnesses the power of the beasts they dwell alongside, often by summoning wild spirits or unleashing the inner savagery of themselves and others to transform them into primeval creatures. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Beasts often wield.

#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

<br><br>


#### Aspect of the Beast

*4th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

#### Bestial Spirit

*4th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

#### Call of the Pack

*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Ranger
___

Unleashing a primal howl, you stir the wild fervor within your allies. You and up to three other creatures you are aware of within range that can hear you are quickened until the start of your next turn. While quickened this way, these creatures gain advantage on attack rolls against any enemy if at least one of their allies is within 5 feet of that enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### Impenetrable Pelt

*5th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1  action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a tuft of fur)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You weave magic to sheathe a willing creature you can see within range in a layer of tough fur and hide. For the spell's duration, any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 5. This reduction applies before any resistances.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage reduction increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

\columnbreak

#### Primal Dominance

*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  10 minutes
- **Classes:**   Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You emanate a commanding presence, compelling a primal creature to submit. Choose a beast, monstrosity, giant, dragon, or fey within range that can see and hear you. If the creature's Intelligence is 8 or higher, the spell has no effect. Otherwise, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes charmed and frightened by you until the end of your next turn. Regardless of the save's outcome, you gain a +5 bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) and Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with that creature until the spell concludes.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.




#### Summon Flock

*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V, S, M (A worm or bug)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon casting, you summon three crows that circle above you for the duration of the spell. As a bonus action, you can direct one of the crows to dive at a creature or object within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 2d4 piercing damage. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is blinded until the start of your next turn. Regardless of the outcome, the directed crow is expended. The spell ends if all crows are expended. For each crow circling above you, you gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.


***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot or higher, you summon an additional crow for each slot level above 1st.

- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes

* It gains a +2 bonus to Strength saving throws and checks.

## Lore of Death

This brand of magic plays on the nature of mortality and fragility of life, though it is strictly distinct from traditional necromancy, as it embraces the inevitability of death rather than attempting to deny it. Its users can manipulate negative energy, sap the vitality of foes, and instill mortal terror in those around them. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Death often wield.

#### Aspect of Dread
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A white feather)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard 
___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Crippling Pain
*3rd-level necromancy*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric Warlock, Wizard

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Horrifying Laughter
*6th-level enchantment*
___

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Wizard
___

You target a creature you can see within range, causing it to collapse into debilitating fits of deranged laughter. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less aren't affected.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration, any creature within 30 feet of the laughing creature that can hear the laughter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the laughing creature until the end of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it stabilizes but remains laughing and can no longer attempt saving throws against the spell. If the spell ends while the creature has 0 hit points, it dies.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Lore of Shadow
This magic specializes in trickery, illusion, <br> and twisting the minds of its targets. Its <br> users primarily rely on illusory magic, though <br> they also wield spells that manipulate shadows <br> and even the nature of space and time as others <br> are able to perceive it, constantly leaving their <br> foes seconding guessing what they're seeing. <br> The following spells are examples of the types <br> of magic users of the Lore of Shadow often wield.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

#### Mirror Dance
*2nd-level conjuration*

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 


 This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot.

#### Pit of Shadows

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

The the line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

# New Creatures

## Avatar of Beasts

From the echoing roars of ancient beasts to the silent stalk of the predator, nature begets a power all its own, an unchecked and relentless force. It is this raw, untamed energy that gives birth to an elemental known as an avatar of beasts, enigmatic entities born from the very soul of the wilderness.

**Primeval Visage.** These towering creatures walk upon the land with long, powerful strides. Their body is a blend of various animal spirits, giving them an almost unpredictable look, though most are bipedal with a vaguely humanoid body shape. A constant is their skull-like head adorned with antlers that rise like darkened spires. Eyes, pools of haunting luminescence, observe the world with primal intensity. Their vast hooved feet, capable of pulverizing any caught in their step, and their supernatural claws, an embodiment of nature's fury, are weapons of unparalleled savagery. With each individual avatar drawing upon various primal animal spirits, no two are exactly alike. One might have the scales of a serpent intermixed with the fur of a lion, while another might possess the feathery mantle and claws of an eagle combined with the armored hide of a rhino.

**Veil of the Wilds.** Despite their daunting size, avatars of beasts possess an uncanny ability to meld with the wilderness. They move through forests, mountains, and swamps as if they were phantoms, impervious to natural barriers and ever-prepared to ambush the unwary. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Their harmony with nature allows them to bypass any plant obstructions their forest homes might impose, making them almost impossible to anticipate.

**Supernatural Savagery.** In battle, these elementals are a spectacle of raw might and eldritch power. While their natural weapons—claws, antlers, and hooves—are deadly enough, their supernatural abilities add another level of terror. They can summon flocks of relentless birds whose sharp talons and beaks dive upon foes with murderous intent, often blinding their victims. When their foes amass to charge them head-on, avatars of beasts are even known to unleash rays of eerie and deadly supernatural light, thought to be the essence of the magic that makes up their being.

**Summoning the Beast.** While these elementals are free spirits of the wild, there are those with the knowledge to call upon them. Druids, shamans, and other mystics of the wilderness, in times of sheer desperation, might perform ancient and savage rituals to summon these mighty beings. These ceremonies are not to be taken lightly, often demanding a primeval sacrifice, where the essence of the wild is offered in exchange for the avatar's aid.

> ***Flock of Doom.*** The avatar fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 100 feet of it with shadowy crows. The avatar can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by the crows. The sphere spreads around corners, and it lasts until the avatar uses the ability again, is more than 100 feet away from the area, or loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The sphere's area is difficult terrain, and creatures in it have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. At the end of each of the avatar's turns, each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 15 (6d4) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is surprised. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 8), it is blinded until the end of the avatar's next turn. On each of the avatar's turns, the avatar may move the crows 50 feet in any direction (no action required). Using this ability does not reveal the avatar if it is hidden from a creature.
> 
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Howl of the Great Beast (1/day).*** The avatar lets out a primeval howl. The avatar can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by it. Each affected creature within 120 feet of it that can hear it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes frightened of the avatar. The creature can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the avatar by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. At the end of its turn, the creature repeats the Wisdom save, ending the effect on it on a success.
>
> ***Bestial Take Down.*** The avatar makes one weapon attack. After the attack, the avatar falls prone. If it has 90 or fewer hit points, the attack is made with advantage.

### Avatar of Beasts Tactics
Avatars of Beasts are ambush predators and experts at stealthily navigating woodland environments to attack from optimal hidden positions. Knocking enemies prone will be their primary tactic throughout the fight as it allows them to stack successive talon attacks on a single target more easily. The avatar never flees from combat unless directed to by someone controlling it.

#### Special Abilities

&emsp;**Flock of Doom.** The avatar generally uses this ability at the start of the fight, ideally before it's even spotted by the players. The avatar will stay hidden for as long as possible while withering away the players with the flock. The avatar will only charge into combat if it manages to blind a vulnerable player it can reach, or one of the players spot it. While the flock is active during combat, the avatar will position it to hinder ranged attackers. 

**Amber Breath.** This ability is deployed when the avatar can hit three or more targets simultaneously. 

#### Attack Sequence

The avatar's primary targets are those blinded by its flock and any vulnerable prey it can reach. The target's distance and whether it's prone affects how the avatar will attack.<br><br>

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Available.** 
* The avatar uses Howl of the Great Beast.
* It then closes the distance and makes a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If finishes with a stomp attack.

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Not Available.** 
* The avatar uses its Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If it manages to knock the target prone, it will follow up with two stomp attacks; otherwise, it will make two talon attacks.

**Targets Beyond 60ft.**
* The avatar dashes to its target.
* The avatar uses the Bestial Take Down bonus action to make a gore attack.
* The avatar stands back up.
Note, if the avatar lacks the remaining movement to stand back up, it will be unlikely to use Bestial Takedown and leave itself vulnerable.

**Targets Already Prone.**
* The avatar attacks with two talon attacks.
* If both attacks hit, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make another talon attack.
* If any of the attacks miss, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a stomp attack.

### Avatar of Beasts Loot
Because these creatures are elementals, they don't have flesh and blood like mundane other creatures, and most of their body disintegrates when they die. Amidst the smokey ashes they leave behind, players may be able to salvage some bone or hide that remained corporeal or even some of their magical essence before it evaporates. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Avatar of Beasts Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Avatar of Beasts Loot Table
| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |

### Bray Shaman Tactics

Bray shamans serve as the primary spellcasters of the beastmen war herds. Unlike most other spellcasters, they are fairly durable and can engage in melee combat while using their spells. With their Primal Fury active, bray shamans can cast spells while also making attacks. This makes them formidable foes as they don't suffer the vulnerabilities of most spellcasters and won't hesitate to dive into melee combat.

The following tactics assume the bray shaman is accompanied by at least two other beastmen.

The lore of magic a bray shaman is specialized in significantly influences its combat tactics. Below are tactics specific to the different lores and their spells:

#### Lore of Beasts

These bray shamans primarily serve a support role, which is helped by the fact that their Wild Heart trait works with most beastmen creatures.

##### Lore of Beasts Spells

**Pass Without Trace:** This ideally cast before combat begins. However, if allies can hide as a bonus action during combat, this spell remains useful during the fight.

**Amber Spear:** This should be cast when there's an opportunity to hit two or more targets.

**Aspect of the Beast:** This is typically cast on the shaman's most powerful ally. Ripping Jaws is generally the most useful for the Beastmen. With it, a beastman can use its Charge ability to topple a target and then bite with a higher chance of success. Additionally, the extra piercing damage from Primal Fury boosts the temporary hit points gained from the Ripping Jaws attack.

**Heroism:** This spell can be useful for either other beastmen or the shaman. It ensures the target isn't easily frightened, helping to mainain their Primal Fury. 

It's important to remember that this spell only benefits from the Wild Heart trait when cast at 1st level. For higher-level shamans, this often becomes their primary concentration spell.

**Monstrous Transformation:** This spell acts as a reset for the shaman. Upon transformation, the likelihood of reverting to their original form during combat is minimal. This spell is generally activated when the shaman's health drops below half or when it loses Primal Fury. While the transformed creature can't cast spells, any prior ongoing spells persist. 

Depending on the situation, the shaman might transform into a:

* **Manticore.** Preferable when adversaries have limited ranged capabilities

* **Hydra.** Chosen when foes have a lower damage output or can't focus their attacks on the transformed shaman

* **Dragon.** Optimal when opponents are grouped together, allowing the dragon's breath to hit multiple targets or when facing adversaries with high elemental damage output.

\columnbreak

#### Lore of Shadows
The Shadow Paths trait of this lore works well when combined with Beastmen who have the Charge ability. By swapping places with units like bestigors or wargors, the shaman can help them get in repeated charges during a fight.

##### Lore of Shadows Spells
**Pit of Shadows:** This spell is used at the earliest opportunity when it can affect two or more targets.

**Mystifying Miasma:** This is the shaman's go-to opening spell, unless *Pit of shadows* is available. It's used to disperse tightly packed enemy formations.

**Penumbral Pendulum:** This is employed when it can strike two or more foes. After casting it, the shaman's allies may attempt to grapple and restrain adversaries, ensuring they remain within the pendulum's path.

**Unseen Lurker:** This spell generally targets the shaman's strongest ally and is cast when no other spells take precedence or if the shaman requires an urgent retreat.

**Shroud of Dusk:** This spell is particularly handy during close-quarters combat. If the bray shaman knows it will have disadvantage on its next attack, this spell's darkness can level the playing field by canceling out any sources of advantage and disadvantage for most creatures in its area.

#### Lore of Death

Bray shamans practicing the Lore of Death tend to reserve their more potent spells for later rounds of combat, capitalizing on the enhanced power derived from their Leech Life ability.

##### Lore of Death Spells

**Circle of Death:** Given its vast area of effect, shamans prefer to cast this spell prior to engaging in melee combat, ensuring maximum enemy exposure.

**Aspect of Dread:** This spell is typically used after the shaman engages in melee combat. After charging in and making a Gore attack, the shaman will cast this spell while surrounded by foes to sow fear.

**Impending Doom:** This spell should target formidable enemy frontline fighters. This will help other beastmen knock them over with charging attacks.

**Inflict Wounds:** Shamans are patient with this spell, waiting for an opportune moment to strike a target when they have advantage.

**Crippling Pain:** This is best cast on agile skirmishers like monks or rogues. Its potency is amplified when targeting a prone adversary, as the act of standing further exacerbates the damage the target takes.

\pagebreakNum

#### Lore of the Wild
Bray shamans dedicated to this lore tend to be less melee-focused, especially those with access to the Savage Domain spell. The majority of their spells require concentration, and a significant portion are good at disrupting opponents' concentration.

##### Lore of the Wild Spells

**Savage Domain:** This spell is cast pre-combat unless doing so would jeopardize a surprise attack. While maintaining concentration on this spell, the shaman keeps its distance, remaining within 60 feet of the summoned monster. The type of summoned creature is typically random unless the shaman possesses prior knowledge about adversaries.

The choices are:

* **Giant:** Chosen if adversaries are adept at avoiding melee or are fighting at a distance

* **Jabberwocky:** Chosen when the objective is to hamper foes with the creature's Burble and other debilitating effects. (Remember that the Burble ability is indiscriminate, potentially affecting even the shaman if it gets too close.)

* **Behemoth:** A versatile monster, adept at singling out and consuming targets, as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

**Mad Rampage:** This should be cast on a unit with multiple attacks. Great Shamans might cast it on the creature summoned with *savage domain*.

**Vile Tide:** This should be used when it can target two or more opponents or disrupt a spell-concentrating foe, especially if *devolve* has already been used on them.

**Bray Scream:** This should be reserved for critical moments. It's typically cast on the shaman itself or on powerful allies like a Wargor or a creature summoned by *savage domain*. It's most effective when the targeted unit is at half-health and can affect at least two foes with the scream.

**Devolve:** This spell is saved for when the shaman can target an enemy spellcaster with it.

### Bray Shaman Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Gor Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Beastman Infantry
The hierarchy of the beastmen is primarily determined by strength and brutality. The bulk of beastmen are known as longhorns and represent the typical members of their kind. Beneath them are the wretched shorthorns who represent the dregs of their society, and above them are the elite besthorns who lord over the rest of their kin. All these beastmen make up the infantry fighters of a beastmen force going to war and are typically lead by the most powerful among them. Warhorns lead smaller war herds or serve as secondary leaders in large war herds, which are typically led by the most powerful of all beastman warriors: the beastlords.

### Shorthorns
Shorthorns, the lowest caste among the beastmen, are a pitiful sight to behold in their dark, twisted society. These lesser beastmen are easily recognized by their diminutive, stunted horns, a physical manifestation of their lowly status within the brutal hierarchy of their kin. Their horns, small and often malformed, set them apart as the weakest and least respected of their race.

Physically, shorthorns possess a devilish appearance, with gaunt frames, sharp, angular features, and eyes that gleam with malice and cunning. Their snarling expressions reveal a nature twisted by resentment and cruelty. Despite their smaller stature and less imposing presence, there is something undeniably sinister about their demeanor, a reflection of the bitterness that festers in their hearts.



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This low status among their brethren imbues the shorthorns with a deep-seated cruelty. They are often treated with contempt and abuse by the larger, stronger beastmen, which in turn makes the shorthorns resentful and vindictive. Given the opportunity, they vent this malice with savage glee, particularly upon captured prisoners who fall into their clutches. 
Their treatment of such unfortunates is merciless and filled with inventive brutality, a means for them to exert power in the few ways they can.

Despite their low rank, shorthorns are essential to the functioning of a beastmen herd. They perform duties that others have no patience for or are too clumsy to handle, such as maintaining weapons and equipment. Their dexterous fingers are well-suited for intricate tasks, and they often find themselves tending to the arms and armor of their more formidable kin, a role that, while menial, is crucial for the warband's effectiveness.

In the chaos of battle, shorthorns are typically relegated to the role of expendable light infantry. Their weak and cowardly nature is well-known, and they are often sent to the front lines as cannon fodder. In the heat of combat, their lack of courage becomes apparent; they are quick to flee at the first sign of the tide turning against them. This behavior reinforces their status as the lowest of their kind, yet their numbers and willingness to swarm the enemy in droves can sometimes turn the tide in a skirmish, albeit at a great cost to their own ranks.

#### Shorthorn Tormentors
Some shorthorns achieve a special level of notoriety, <br> earning them the title Tormentor. These shorthorns, renowned for their exceptional cruelty and proficiency <br> in torture, wield poisonous spears with chilling <br> expertise. Unlike their typical counterparts, tormentors <br> are feared and respected, not for brute strength, but for <br> their ability to inflict prolonged agony. Their spears, laced with lethal toxins from forest flora and fauna, are designed <br> to incapacitate and torture rather than kill swiftly. In battle, these weapons become instruments of terror, <br> foreshadowing the grim fate of those who fall into their clutches, and they take deviant glee in ganging up on vulnerable targets.

The tormentors' notoriety, however, is most pronounced <br> in their role as skilled torturers. Their gruesome methods are a perverse art form, earning them a unique, elevated status within the beastmen's brutal society. Beastmen chieftains often entrust them with the torture of particularly hated captives, a task they relish. This grim responsibility grants the Tormentors a level of respect and authority rarely afforded to other shorthorns.

#### Shorthorn Raiders

Shorthorn raiders occupy a unique and vital role within the ranks of the beastmen. As specialists in scouting and ranged combat, these shorthorns distinguish themselves through their proficiency with crudely made bows, a rarity in a culture that typically favors brute force and melee combat. Their skill with these weapons, combined with their natural agility and stealth, makes them ideal scouts and ranged support for the more brutish members of their kind. Shorthorn raiders are adept at moving silently through dense forests, their keen eyes and sharp senses constantly scanning for signs of the enemy or opportunities for ambush.

The intelligence gathered by these raiders is invaluable to the beastmen chieftains, enabling them to coordinate devastating ambushes and strike at prime targets with little to no warning. Their ability to relay critical information about enemy movements, weaknesses, and terrain plays a pivotal role in the beastmen's guerrilla warfare tactics. In the heat of battle, shorthorn raiders skulk on the fringes, loosing volleys of arrows into the enemy ranks, sowing chaos and confusion from a distance while their brethren engage in close-quarters bloodshed.

However, the ambitions of the shorthorn raiders often extend beyond mere reconnaissance. Emboldened by their mastery of stealth and archery, they sometimes undertake their own raids, pillaging and burning villages when they believe they can evade retribution. These raids are swift and brutal, characterized by a sudden onslaught of arrows followed by the merciless slaughter of any who survive the initial assault.

#### Shorthorn Stalkers

Shorthorn stalkers represent the pinnacle of skill and discipline among the shorthorn raiders, setting a standard for stealth and skirmishing tactics that few in the beastmen ranks can match. These elite raiders are renowned for their hit-and-run tactics, striking with precision and vanishing before the enemy can mount a proper defense. Their exceptional agility and mastery of the terrain allow them to navigate the densest forests and roughest terrains with ease, making them the perfect operatives for quick, devastating strikes. 

As scouts, the shorthorn stalkers are remarkably reliable and disciplined, a trait that is somewhat atypical in the often chaotic and impulsive beastmen society. They excel in reconnaissance, gathering crucial information about enemy positions, numbers, and movements with a level of efficiency that is invaluable to any beastman chieftain. Their reports are precise and timely, allowing for the swift planning of raids and ambushes. In the field, they act as the eyes and ears of the beastmen warbands, ensuring that their brute force is applied with strategic cunning and surprise, maximizing the impact of their attacks.

The role of the shorthorn stalkers in the beastmen hierarchy is unique. Despite their lowly origins, their skills and contributions are indispensable, earning them a place of unique value in the herd. They are the silent, deadly shadow of the beastmen hordes, often the difference between a successful raid and a disastrous engagement.

### Longhorns

Longhorns are the primary representation of a beastman, forming the backbone of their savage herds. They are a fearsome blend of animal and human. Their lower bodies boast powerful, goat-like, bipedal legs, adept for traversing rough, forested terrains with ease. Their human-like torsos and arms showcase grotesque but powerful muscles. Above this, their heads are akin to that of a fanged goat, complete with menacing horns. However, within their ranks, many variations of beastman can exist, exhibiting a mix of traits from different wild animals. This diversity adds to their terrifying presence, as each longhorn presents a unique yet uniformly intimidating appearance.

The longhorns make up the majority of the beastmen herds. Their numbers are vast, and they form the core of the beastmen's marauding forces. Characterized by their rowdy and impulsive nature, longhorns are creatures of instinct and aggression. They are quick to anger, and once provoked, their fury is relentless and brutal. This temperament, while often chaotic, is a significant asset in the heat of battle, as it fuels their ferocity and resilience. However, once they lose their momentum and their fury burns out, they can become less confident and unreliable fighters.

Longhorns are primarily melee combatants, relying on their natural speed and brute strength to overpower their foes. They typically lack discipline, and their equipment is often crudely made and poorly maintained, but what they lack in finesse, they more than make up for with sheer rage-fueled power. Their approach to battle is straightforward and savage: they charge headlong into enemy ranks, using their horns, teeth, and any weapon at hand to wreak havoc. This makes them excellent shock troops, capable of breaking enemy lines through sheer force and the intimidating might of their charge. Foes knocked prone by the charge of their horns are quickly dogpiled by other beastmen who relish the opportunity to prey on a newly vulnerable victim.

#### Longhorn Ravagers

Longhorn ravagers, a notorious subgroup within the beastman ranks, are as feared for their chaotic behavior as they are for their combat prowess. Known for their love of potent, rank brews, these ravagers are seldom seen without their signature flasks or containers of alcohol. This drink, foul to any but their own kind, serves as a source of inebriation and a form of battle stimulant. In the midst of combat, the intoxicating effects of their brew do more than impair; they invigorate the ravagers, fueling their already formidable aggression and bolstering their confidence. This alcohol-induced bravado often turns the tide of battle, as the ravagers, lost in their drunken fury, become even more fearsome and unpredictable adversaries.

The longhorn ravagers have also developed a unique fighting style that incorporates their drinking vessels. Whether it's a crude mug, a battered flask, or even an entire keg, these containers are not just for holding their brew but are also cleverly used as improvised shields. This unconventional approach to defense is surprisingly effective, allowing the ravagers to absorb blows that would fell lesser beastmen. 


\columnbreak

<br>

Despite their drunken demeanor, the destructive power of the longhorn ravagers should not be underestimated. Their alcohol-induced courage often leads them to hold their ground in the face of overwhelming odds, where other beastmen might break and flee. This tenacity, coupled with their wild, unpredictable nature, makes them unlikely elite warriors. In battle, the ravagers are the embodiment of chaotic strength, a whirlwind of fury and resilience, their roars of inebriated rage echoing as both a battle cry and a warning to all who face them.

<br>

> ##### Number of Swig Uses
> The default number of uses of the Swig represents the average amount of drink a longhorn is carrying with it at any given time. There may be a reason why a longhorn would have more or less drink on its person, and you can adjust the number of daily uses of the Swig ability to reflect this.

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Shorthorn Tactics
These beastmen are weak and cowardly by nature and will usually only press an attack if they feel they have an advantage that tips the odds in their favor. This advantage could range from a surprise attack to overwhelming numbers or the use of forested terrain to launch hit-and-run attacks. Once they feel they're on the winning side, shorthorns will charge in with the same reckless ferocity common to most beastmen.

##### Shorthorn Tormentors
These beastmen typically move ahead of the rest of their warband, setting up ambushes that their allies can capitalize on. If they can pull off the ambush, they'll use their poisonous attacks to weaken players and leave them more susceptible to the charges of other beastmen. Once an enemy is prone, the tormentors will surround it and ensure it can't get back up. These tactics make tormentors ideal allies for stronger beastmen like longhorns and besthorns.

##### Shorthorn Raiders and Stalkers
These beastmen are unique in that they avoid rushing into battle to use their Charge ability. Instead, they specialize in targeting foes their allies can't reach in close combat. They are skillful and opportunistic archers and will take cover between their attacks whenever possible.

#### Longhorn Tactics
Longhorns make up the bulk of most beastmen warherds. When fighting together, they form a rowdy mob drunk on their confidence and recklessly charging into enemies. If the fight doesn't quickly go in their favor, sobering reality may set in, causing them to break and flee if they don't have a leader keeping them in line.

##### Longhorn Ravagers
These beastmen's signature ability is Swig. They will typically expend a use of the ability just before combat, letting the poisoned condition clear while retaining the temporary hit points. 

In the heat of battle, they will use the Swig ability again if they lose their Primal Fury or they drop below half health. It's important that they use Swig after they've made their attacks for the turn so they can minimize the disadvantage from being poisoned.

Because of their drunken nature, these beastmen will be even more wild and reckless than the rest of their kin, and you can reflect this by having them take more foolhardy actions in combat.

#### Besthorns
Because these elite warriors wear heavy armor, they often can't rely on stealth and ambush tactics unless they have cover from heavy vegetation. If they're unlikely to successfully sneak up on players, but they're teamed up with other beastmen who can, the besthorns will charge the players head-on. This will allow the sneakier beastmen an opportunity to move around and attack from behind while the players are distracted.

##### Besthorn Manrippers
These beastmen prioritize attacking targets with low Strength so they can best utilize their Hewing Greataxe attacks. However, if the enemies they can reach all have high AC or abilities that make them hard to hit, the manrippers will change their strategy to attacking foes that are grouped up so they can attempt to make use of their Arcing Swing ability.

#### Warhorns and Beastlords
These beastmen leaders fight from within the center of their minions, extending their aura to as many beastmen as possible. Because they're constantly seeking the favor of their dark gods, they will often challenge the most powerful adversaries they can find to prove their worth.

Because of their armor, their ambush options are often limited, and so they typically use the same combat initiation tactics as besthorns.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Managing Primal Fury At Scale
 
If you're managing a lot of beastmen in combat and prefer not to roll each of the Primal Fury checks individually each time they come up, the following set of alternative rules can streamline this process.


At the beginning of combat, all beastmen enter combat with their Primal Fury active. On initiative count 20 each turn (losing all initiative ties), roll a d20. If the roll is 11 or higher, the Primal Fury of all beastmen remains active; if it is less, the Primal Fury ends for all beastmen until the next initiative count 20. Add a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll for each beastman in the encounter that is neither charmed nor frightened. Subtract 1 from the roll for each beastman that has been reduced to 0 hit points since the last roll.

Specific abilities of some of the beastmen modify these rules as follows:

**Crown of Horns, Will of the Dark Gods, and Apocalyptic Vision.** If there is a beastman in the battle with one of these abilities, add a +5 bonus to the roll rather than providing advantage, as long as the beastman providing the ability is not charmed or frightened. If there are multiple beastmen with these abilities, the effects are cumulative.

## Beastmen Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

### Crown of Horns 
*This creature is gifted with especially large and grandiose twisting horns, granting it extreme confidence, for it knows it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

When the beastman makes a Wisdom check caused by its Primal Fury ability, it automatically succeeds unless it has disadvantage on the roll.

### Gnarled Hide

*The beastman's hide has toughed up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The beastman gets +2 to its AC.

### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Beastman's charge deals extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage in addition to it's normal damage.

### Many Limbed Monster

*The beastman sports an extra pair of clawed arms to tear at its enemies.*

When the beastman takes the attack action, it makes one additional attack as part of the action, which uses the attack modifier of its Gore attack. On hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage. (The attack also gains the benefits of Primal Fury.)

### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Shadow Hide

*The beastman's black fur melds perfectly with the darkness around it, allowing it to stalk its prey from the shadows while completely unseen.*

While in darkness, the beastman is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness. Additionally, it does not suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks from wearing Armor.
Finally, it gains the Bestial Ambush ability as described below. If it already has a Bestial Ambush ability, the damage bonus of its Bestial Ambush is increased by 9 (2d8).

***Bestial Ambush.*** When the beastman takes the Attack action for the first time each combat, its walking speed increases by 20 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If it hits with an attack during that turn that has advantage, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage.

### Slug-Skin

*This beastman's disgusting skin oozes thick, slippery, toxic slime.*

At the end of the beastman's turn, any ground within 5 feet of it is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Creatures standing in the area have disadvantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, and prone creatures in the area must spend all their movement to stand up instead of half. If a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. 

Creatures with Primal Fury trait ignore the effects of the slime (regardless of whether their Primal Fury is active or not). A gallon or more of water moving more than 5 miles per hour will wash the slime away from a 5-foot square area.

### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

> ##### Using Mutations To Create Urgency In Adventures
> If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with beastmen and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the beastmen in the adventure gain mutations as time passes. This means the more slowly and carefully the players progress, the more dangerous the beastmen will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. 
> 
> If you want the mutations to be random, you can roll a d8 to determine what mutation they will gain (number each of the abilities in alphabetical order).
>
> The rate at which they gain mutations could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.
