# Ninja Ratfolk Compilation

## Creatures


### Ratfolk Deathmaster

Only the most skilled, cunning, and ruthlessly determined ninja ratfolk can obtain the title of deathmaster. This ratfolk is the paragon of its art, possessed of unbreakable discipline and unrivaled deadliness. Only one ratfolk holds the title of deathmaster at any given time, and the position is highly sought after by master assassins. 

The deathmaster is tasked with only the most vital missions whose success has grand strategic implications for the ratfolk clans at large. No mortal is safe from the deathmaster's reach, whether they be a mighty warlord, paranoid wizard, or powerful monarch secure in a supposedly impregnable fortress. 

In combat, the deathmaster flies in and out of the fray, dispatching foes before disappearing into the shadows, only to launch another attack from an unexpected angle. It wields a deadly weeping blade in each hand and a third with its tail, turning it into a whirlwind of death. Foes who try to pin down the deathmaster find that it can escape from any restraints before disappearing into the darkness using its cloak of shadows. The last thing most pursuers see is the glint of acid-coated blades as the deathmaster unleashes a fatal counterattack.

### Ratfolk Death Runner

hese ratfolk are the elite minions of their clans. Death runners either lead squads of gutter runners or form squads of their own when faced with situations that require the best of the best their clan has to offer. They utilize the same tactics as their gutter runner subordinates, but with a near-supernatural level of mastery. Death runners are often sent deep into enemy territory on what would be suicide missions for any other ratfolk. Here they eliminate high-value targets, steal the most precious of information, and unleash any other forms of mayhem their masters desire. Most importantly, death runners perform these tasks without leaving any trace of their presence. 

Death runners are also privy to some of the finest equipment their clans have to offer. They wield deadly blades dripping with poisons that can rapidly subdue even the hardiest of foes. Victims who are repeatedly subjected to their attacks find the toxins to become progressively more devastating, and death runners are brutally relentless when assaulting high-priority targets.

#### Death Runners of Renown
These ratfolk are members of some of the most notorious death runner units, often referred to as death squads. These renowned death runners often wear uniforms with distinctive colors and patterns to signify their elite membership. These uniforms also usually pay homage to a particularly well-known master from their clan’s history who may have even been the original founder of the death squad.

Renowned death runners possess combat skill that surpasses that of “ordinary” death runners, making them the elite amongst an already elite class. Besides having greater skill and dexterity, these death runners have mastered advanced techniques allowing them to mitigate deadly blows from enemies as they retreat from range and prepare counterstrikes. These evasive techniques make them even more difficult foes to pin down and slay, and most who attempt to do so are quickly dispatched by the poison blades of these renowned death runners.

### Ratfolk Gutter Runner

Ratfolk who survive their dangerous apprenticeships as night runners can rise through the ranks of their clan to become deadly gutter runners. These ratfolk serve as special operations forces, carrying out covert missions that require their level of subtlety and skill. Gutter runner missions may include sabotage, espionage, or guerilla warfare. A gutter runner strike is often a prelude to a larger ratfolk attack, as they remove key enemy assets, destroy equipment, and weaken defenses to pave the way for a larger strike force.

When engaged in combat, gutter runners excel in hit-and-run attacks. Their near-supernatural agility allows them to dodge most attacks with ease, negating the need for armor. This lack of armor allows them to move quickly and operate as effective skirmishers. Gutter runners excel at hit-and-run style attacks, utilizing throwing stars to harry their foes before closing in for deadly strikes the moment they see an opening. Enemies find that trying to engage gutter runners directly is like grabbing at smoke, and they never strike the same way twice, constantly leaving opponents disoriented.

### Ratfolk Night Runner
While most ratfolk are known for employing <br> sneaky, underhanded tactics, night runners make <br> a career of it. These  skirmishing soldiers fight in <br> mobile packs that utilize stealth and guerilla tactics to <br> harry their foes.  Once foes look sufficiently weakened <br> and vulnerable, night runners move in for the kill, <br> using a flurry of throwing stars and flashing blades <br> to quickly dispatch their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, night runners serve as light skirmisher infantry who utilize their mobility to harass and disrupt enemies ahead of attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a dangerous task with a low survival rate, ensuring that only the most skilled night runners advance far in their careers.

Those few ratfolk who manage to ascend through the ranks of their shadowy clan may eventually become dreaded assassins, representing the pinnacle of their deadly art. These dreaded killers carry out the most vital missions of their clan and usually hire their services out to other clans and even non-ratfolk. Assassins usually operate alone, carrying out operations that would be impossible for multiple ratfolk to accomplish. Killing important figures in heavily guarded locations, tracking the whereabouts of elusive individuals, and pilfering priceless information or artifacts are all within the prevue of an assassin. 

<br><br>

In times of war, assassins will often disguise as rank-and-file ratfolk, joining their kin in battle until they come within range of a high-value target. At that moment, the assassin springs forth dispatching foes with a whirl of poisoned blades, appearing as a blurred shadow as they deal death to their unprepared victims. At other times, assassins are tasked with sneaking behind enemy lines to slay dangerous but fragile targets, such as commanders, spellcasters, or weapon crews. Their speed and agility allow them to perform such strikes and retreat before their enemies can react to the attack.

#### Master Assassins
The most skilled assassins are given the title of Master, and it is said only thirteen such masters exist at any one time. These assassins possess a level of agility that surpasses that of nearly any mortal creature, making it almost impossible to land a meaningful strike on them. And any who attempt to do so will be mercilessly cut down by a flurry of poisoned attacks in the process. 

The skill of these assassins is such that their clan almost never makes their services available to outsiders and they are only assigned the most vital of missions. On the rare occasions that their clan must wage open war, their nimble forces are led by master assassins who are able to expertly direct their clan members and maximize their deadly potential.

### Ratfolk Ninja Sorcerer

These mystics wield shadowy magics designed to aid <br> the warriors of their clan. Ninja sorcerers are quite <br> rare, and they are very secretive about the nature of <br> their magic. How they recruit new members and how <br> their ranks are organized is a mystery even to many <br> with their clans. They rarely consort with those outside <br> the ranks of the ratfolk ninja clans and usually only <br> carry out missions in direct service of their shadowy <br> masters. 

Ninja sorcerers are typically assigned to support larger groups of their clan carrying out covert missions, where <br> their magic can be put to maximum effect. Their spells conjure shadows and illusions to confuse foes and provide cover for their allies. Ninja sorcerers can also enhance the combat ability of their allies, making their already swift <br> and stealthy clan members even faster and stealthier. If enemies attempt to engage them directly, they can quickly throw up smoke and shadow, disappearing out of sight <br> before rallying their allies for a deadly counterstrike.

### Ratfolk Triad

The ninja clans of the ratfolk focus on training <br> skirmishers and covert operatives for special <br> operations and make less use of the traditional <br> soldiers of other clans. Still, there are times <br> when it becomes necessary for these clans to <br> field ratfolk who can operate as battlefield <br> soldiers and engage foes more directly. The <br> largest and most physically imposing of the <br> ninja clans are trained as triads to fulfill this <br> role They combine the martial tactics of <br> their clan with traditional battlefield <br> training to become deadly and evasive <br> light infantry. 

Though triads don’t wear the heavy armor <br> of other soldiers, they possess the natural <br> evasiveness of their clan which helps them <br> avoid harm as they utilize their deadly <br> polearms.  These polearms are tipped with <br> insidious weeping blades which earn their <br> name from the caustic acid that continually <br> drips from their edge. This acid burns <br> through the flesh and armor of their <br> enemies, allowing triads to dispatch <br> even the most formidable and heavily <br> armored of foes.

#### Triad of Duplicity

These triads have studied the shadowy magics of their <br> clans to gain supernatural powers of illusion. At a <br> moment’s notice, they can summon illusory <br> doppelgangers of themselves, making them appear <br> to be in two locations at once. Triads of duplicity use <br> these abilities to bewilder foes on the battlefield, <br> appearing to charge from one direction only to pop <br> out and attack from another. 

An entire squad of triads may be made of illusionary decoys, meant to draw enemies into vulnerable <br> positions or trick them into squandering valuable <br> resources attempting to destroy their fake foes. Once <br> their prey has fallen for the ruse, the real triads leap <br> from hiding and make them pay dearly for their <br> mistake.

>
> A creature can use an action to examine the illusion, making a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the target ignores all effects of the illusion. Hitting the illusion with an attack (AC 16) or targeting it with an effect that only targets it will also reveal it is an illusion.

> ##### Optional Rule: Smoke Bombs
>In place of an attack as part of an Attack action, the ratfolk can throw a smoke grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. The grenade emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area within a 20-foot radius of where it lands. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.

You cause a whirlwind of vile smoke and stinging ashes to rush up at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 20-foot radius of that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and loses any darkvision it has until the end of its next turn. On a successful save,  a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its darkvision.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. The spell also snuffs out any non-magical fire in its area.

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become brittle for the duration. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

A 20-foot-radius sphere of smoke appears centered on yourself, and you may immediately move up to 30 feet. The area within the smoke is heavily obscured. While inside the smoke, you may move through the space of other creatures. If you end your movement inside a creature's space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.   After you end your movement, you may immediately take the hide action as part of this bonus action. The smoke lasts until the end of your next turn or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned this way can repeat the Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the poison damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Ninja-Themed Magic Items


#### Armor of Trepidation
*Armor (light, medium, and heavy), rare*<br>
This armor holds the natural trepidation of the ratfolk that forged it.

You have a +3 bonus to AC while wearing this armor and are frightened. While wearing this armor and frightened, you may willingly move closer to the source of your fear as well.

#### Cloak of Darkness
*Wonderous item, very rare*<br>
This cloak was woven from the hair of murder victims and spider silk and allows its wearer to become undetectable in darkness.

While in darkness while wearing this cloak, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness, are hidden from divination magic, and can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

#### Tenebrous Pedant 
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This pendant was crafted from the skull of a ratfolk shadow master and emits dark, smokey incense that can be used to cloak its wearer in inky darkness. 

The pendant has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word and expend 1 or more of its charges. When you do so, shadows begin pouring out from it for a number of minutes equal to the charges you expended or until you use another bonus action to command it to stop. While the shadows are pouring out, dim light within 10 feet of you turns into darkness, and bright light in the same area is turned into dim light. 

\columnbreak

If an area being dimed by the pendant overlaps with an area being illuminated by a spell of 1st level or higher, the pendent shuts off early.

The pendant regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk.

#### Triad Stars
*Weapon (throwing star), rare (requires attunement)*<br>
These three magical throwing stars were carved from the bones of a master assassin. You must possess all three to attune to them. While attuned to them, you can use an action to cause all three to teleport into your hand. 

Each star adds a +1 to attack rolls made with it. When you strike a target with a star, it takes an additional 1d4 piercing damage. If it has been hit by one of the other stars within the last minute, it instead takes an additional 2d4 piercing damage. If it has been hit by both of the other stars within the last minute, it instead takes an additional 3d4 piercing damage.

#### Weeping Blade 
*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*<br>

This blade constantly drips with a black acid that can eat through armor.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to deal an additional 2d6 acid damage and cover it in acid. The creature remains covered in acid until it or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. At the end of a creature’s turn, if it is covered in acid this way, it takes 2d6 acid damage, and any armor it is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.

## New Weapon: Throwing Star
These small, sharpened metal stars can be thrown or used as a stabbing weapon to deal small amounts of damage and potentially deliver poisoned attacks.  Their small size and unassuming nature make them ideal concealed weapons.


#### Throwing Star
*ranged weapon (simple)*
___
- **Damage:** 1
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Finesse, light, thrown(20/60), special
- **Cost:** 5 sp
- **Weight:** 1/10 lb
___

***Throwing Star.*** You can use two-weapon fighting to make off-hand attacks with throwing stars as though they are melee weapons, and you can use throwing stars to make melee weapon attacks as though they are light melee weapons. However, you still have disadvantage on these attack rolls if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and isn't incapacitated. 



### New Feat: Throwing Star Master
You mastered the art of using the normally unassuming throwing star to disrupt your foes and set up brutal follow-on attacks, granting you the following benefits:  

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with throwing stars.

* You can draw a throwing star as part of the attack you make with it.

* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using a throwing star that did not suffer from disadvantage, you can gain advantage on the next melee weapon attack or unarmed strike you make against that creature this turn.
