# Bonus Savage Orcs

## Savage Orc Infantry

### Savage Orc Arrow Monger

Orc arrow mongers are considered the greatest archers among savage orc tribes. This is not due to any refined expertise in archery; in fact, they are fairly inaccurate because of their fervent lust for combat, which results in them loading and aiming their weapons in a hasty, haphazard manner. However, this zealous desire for bloodshed allows them to draw massive great bows with ease—bows so powerful that even a regular orc would struggle to wield them.

On the battlefield, their relentless volleys darken the skies, unleashing clouds of flint-headed arrows, each the size of a human war pike. As their arrows pierce through enemy ranks—whether by chance or in the rare instance that an orc briefly steadies its aim—the sight of their foes being skewered by a storm of projectiles only fuels their bloodlust. With each moment, the downpour of arrows intensifies.

### Savage Orc Berserker

It is rare, but within the savage orc tribes, some orcs descend into such frenzied states that they are considered mad—even by the brutal standards of their kin. These orcs are raving, simple-minded monsters, easily provoked into violent rampages over the smallest slights.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

The cause of this insatiable bloodlust remains unknown, even among savage orcs. The most plausible explanations suggest it is triggered either by the aftermath of a particularly brutal battle or by an orc being swept up in an especially potent wave of orcish magic. Yet, even these theories remain unproven, as such transformations can occur without any clear catalyst.

Orcs afflicted with this madness grow increasingly agitated over time, tormented by violent voices in their heads. They seek out any excuse for conflict, attacking anything that moves in their periphery or venturing alone into the wilderness to hunt dangerous beasts with no regard for their own survival. Eventually, a berserker loses the ability to speak, managing only a few guttural words during a war cry. Such orcs must either be exiled—beaten unconscious by their tribe and abandoned far from their settlement—or simply avoided as their kin scatter, hoping the berserker becomes too preoccupied hacking apart whatever unfortunate creature has drawn its wrath. More often than not, that victim is another member of the tribe.

However, some tribes with powerful shamans or mighty chieftains manage to keep these mad warriors in check. A chieftain may subdue a berserker through sheer brute strength, mercilessly beating them into submission, imprisoning them in crude cages, or even burying them in the ground with only their howling head exposed.

Shamans, on the other hand, use hexes and enchantments to incapacitate them, forcing them into a drunken stupor. But when the time for war arrives, all restraints are cast aside, and the berserkers are unleashed upon the battlefield.

Savvy commanders who understand the berserkers’ deranged nature view them as uncontrollable yet predictable—akin to an avalanche crashing down upon their enemies. The destructive power of a band of savage orc berserkers rivals that of a natural disaster, as they swing bone axes with such force that they can cleave a horse in two. Should an adversary manage to sidestep a devastating strike, it only serves to enrage the brute further, sending them into even greater heights of unhinged fury.


### Savage Orc Darkfoots

Among Savage Orcs, nothing brings greater joy than crushing powerful foes beneath hefty stone cudgels, skewering them with bone-and-flint spears, and claiming their remains as trophies—unmistakable proof of their supremacy in battle. Yet despite their passion for raw violence, these primal orcs harbor a deep abhorrence for demons, aberrations, undead, and similar horrors born of malignant magic.

While such creatures may share the orcs’ penchant for mayhem, they also spread decay and madness, leaving corruption in their wake. Primal weaponry rarely suffices against these abominations, and even if the creatures fall, their foul remnants continue to poison the land. For these reasons, their mere presence inspires unbridled hatred in the hearts of Savage Orcs.

This hatred often drives many to undertake crusades in the name of the great Orcish gods, seeking to purge these nightmarish entities that twist the purity of brute force. Those who dedicate themselves to this mission are called Darkfoots. These grim warriors mark their bodies with white war paint—making their flesh resemble bleached bone—and streaks of red. In addition to the usual protective properties of orcish paint, these markings ward off the corrupting magic that might weaken their resolve.

When a Darkfoot grasps a weapon, it becomes infused with righteous fury against the unnatural, striking even incorporeal spirits and bypassing wards designed to thwart physical attacks. Most tribes include at least one Darkfoot, who closely allies with the shamans to root out any malignant presence endangering the community. In lands beset by such abominations, entire tribes may be composed of Darkfoots, who viciously hunt and eradicate these monstrosities. Sometimes, one or more Darkfoots roams the world, loyal to no single tribe but only to their sacred duty, lending their strength wherever orcs battle otherworldly threats.

Though these warriors purge evil entities, one should never assume they would spare others who oppose such threats. Darkfoots have been known to raze wizard or bard colleges for employing illusion or enchantment, dismissing these practices as deceptive and un-Orcish. Likewise, they have slain celestial beings that used holy abjurations to quell conflict, branding such interference as a violation of their war-gods’ will.

### Savage Orc Stalkers
Savage orcs who take up the mantle of a stalker possess a bestial nature unmatched by any other in their tribe, inspiring the same respect and fear a wild predator would. An orc who embarks on this path typically harbors a spark of spiritual power that might have led them to become a beast dancer or shaman. However, their thirst for hunt steers them away from such a fate, and their connection to primal magic drives them into the depths of the untamed wilderness in search of worthy prey.

Those who survive this perilous endeavor return changed, both in appearance and demeanor. They are covered in the hides of the creatures they have bested, with claws, horns, teeth, or other bony appendages from their fallen foes strapped to their arms as makeshift weapons. Unlike most Savage Orcs, stalkers are patient and rarely engage in petty conflicts, often silently observing the vast landscape they inhabit. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br>

Yet, when the moment arises, their austere composure vanishes in the blink of an eye, replaced by a primal fervor that sends them feverishly stabbing at whatever has roused their wrath. In these fits of wrath, a stalker is consumed by bloodlust, continuing to carve and tear even after their foe is but a gory heap.

When a tribe of savage orcs departs to hunt the primeval beasts that roam their lands, a stalker leads the way, given a wide berth by their comrades as they employ their unparalleled tracking skills. The moment their quarry is spotted, the stalker rushes forward, mercilessly tearing into it. Should their opponent attempt to flee, it only incites the hunter further, spurring them into a relentless pursuit.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

### Savage Orc Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs. 

#### Arrow Monger

* Arrow mongers use their Loose Arrows feature to strike targets with AC 16 or lower.

#### Berserker

* Berserkers unleash reckless attacks whenever they fight an enemy wearing medium or heavy armor (AC 16 or higher). They are not very intelligent and will charge at the first foe in their path.

#### Darkfoots

* Darkfoots target spellcasters, undead, aberrations, and fiends first, seeking to eliminate them before engaging other foes.


#### Stalkers
* Stalkers sneak up on their targets. If multiple enemies are present, they prioritize ranged attackers and spellcasters, attempting to force them into retreat and provoke an opportunity attack.

## Savage Orc Spirit Dancers

Among the primitive orcish tribes, hunting the most dangerous monsters was considered the most sacred of rites. They believed that the Orcish Gods imbued wild beasts with fragments of their divine ferocity—especially the more fearsome and untamed creatures, which were thought to contain the greatest concentration of this power. By slaying these beasts, crafting weapons, fetishes, and trinkets from their bones, and mixing their fat and blood into ritualistic war paints, orcs sought to absorb the might of their prey, merging their own spirits with the primal essence of these formidable creatures.

At the heart of this practice were the spirit dancers. When a tribe felled a truly mighty beast, the spirit dancer was granted the portion of the creature deemed to contain its greatest essence. From this, they would craft totems, charms, or adornments, incorporating them into their own bodies as relics of power. Over time, a seasoned spirit dancer would accumulate a trove of these mystical trinkets, each infused with the raw might of fallen creatures. Through strange and ancient dances, they could awaken the latent spirit within these relics, channeling their power to imbue the tribe’s warriors with supernatural strength. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

Those blessed by the spirit dancer might charge into battle with the momentum of a rhino, unleash the deafening trumpet of a mammoth, or strike with the lethal precision of a predatory beast.

As the decades passed, many orc tribes abandoned the sacred hunt, their traditions fading with the rise of technology and the extinction of the great megafauna. However, among the savage orcs, the rite remains venerated. These tribes continue their sacred hunts, seeking out the last vestiges of feral might that persist in the world. Many have become nomadic, forever roaming in search of prey worthy of their ancestral challenge. Any who cross their path—or worse, attempt to hinder their sacred quest—must face not only the fury of seasoned hunters but also the unleashed wrath of their spiritual menagerie.

The most skilled among the spirit dancers—those who have amassed the greatest collection of trophies crafted from the most powerful beasts—are known as invokers. Their mastery is so great that they can summon forth the true essence of the creatures they embody, infusing their warriors with unmatched wild fury, allowing them to rend their enemies to pieces.

While disrupted, the creature can't gain the benefits of the Disengage or Dodge action, and if it is within 10 feet of the orc, it has disadvantage on all attacks. If the attack was made using a quickened action, the creature deals only half damage with attacks while within 10 feet of the orc while it is disrupted. |

Until this grapple ends, the orc can't attack another target. If it was a ranged attack, the target is pinned to a surface within 5 feet, reducing its speed to 0. A creature within 5 feet of the pinned target can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the effect on a success. If the attack was made using a quickened action, the creature is restrained until the grapple or pin ends. |

### Spirit Dancer Tactics
Spirit dancers and invokers avoid direct combat, staying still to channel their Mumbo Jumbo Dance and empower allies through One With The Beast. 

Invokers unleash Wild Surge, always targeting the strongest melee warrior for maximum impact.

#### Beast Spirit Target Priorities

Creatures infused with the different spirits follow the targeting priorities below:

* **Boar.** Blocks enemies from reaching allies; creatures with ranged attacks can kite enemies.

* **Triceratops.** Counters ranged foes and mobile targets by forcing them into close combat.

* **Rhino.** Disrupts backline spellcasters, dragging them out of position; creatures with ranged attacks can pin mobile targets.

* **Mammoth.** Attacks the largest cluster of enemies.

* **Tyrannosaurus.** Wears down high-AC, low-HP foes.

* **Wolf.** Hunts down slow-moving foes, aiding allies.

<br>

### Using Beast Spirits To Create Urgency In Adventures
 If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with savage orcs and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the orcs summon more and more bestial spirits to imbue themselves as time passes. This means the more slowly the players progress, the more dangerous the savage orcs will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. You can roll on the Beast Spitit table to determine what spirit they gain.

The rate at which they gain spirits could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.

 Potential scenarios where the orcs are gaining more power over time:

 *  The orcs are hunting down divine beasts, slaying them to capture their power.

 *  Their shamans have begun a grand ritual, drawing in more spirits to infuse their warriors with supernatural might.

 *  A savage orc warboss has taken control of the tribe, convincing them to return to the old ways. As they embrace their primal heritage, they grow stronger, more feral, and deeply attuned to their instincts.

 *  The orcs foresee a great war destined to unfold during a powerful celestial event. As the moment approaches, they become consumed by a rising, savage energy, preparing for the battle to come.

\columnbreak

### New Condition: Quickened
 A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

### New Condition: Wounds
While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
 
  * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
  * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
  * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

### New Spell: Wild Surge

*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (a tuft of fur and a fang)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Select a willing creature within range to tap into its primal nature, transforming it into a bestial form. For the duration of the spell, the creature receives the following benefits:

* It gains 20 temporary hit points.
* It gains a +2 bonus to AC.
* It gains a +2 bonus to Strength saving throws and checks.
* It gains a +2 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
* When it hits with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, it deals one extra die of its damage.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the targeted creature gains an additional 5 temporary hit points for each slot level above 3rd.

## Zunk, Gob of the Gods

**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Individual, Relics

Most savage orc spirit-invokers teeter on the edge of insanity, overwhelmed by the clamor of divine voices and the torrent of bestial energies coursing through them. None exemplify this more than Zunk, self-proclaimed Gob of the Gods, who believes the Orcish deities speak to him through his juju beast familiar. These voices urge him to recruit the land’s fiercest hunters, band them together, and track down the deadliest creatures roaming existence.

Convinced of his sacred mission, Zunk leads his elite followers into the most remote corners of the world, each perilous journey culminating in the slaying of a legendary monstrosity. As they claim their prize, Zunk absorbs the creature’s spirit into his ever-growing menagerie. With every conquest, his powers surge, and the commands relayed through his familiar grow more daring, urging the warband to pursue even mightier prey.

This relentless crusade has not gone unnoticed. Many view Zunk and his disciples as a scourge, for the beasts they target are often prized war mounts, revered by noble rulers, or venerated by local communities. Yet those who seek retribution or attempt to halt Zunk’s so-called “holy mission” quickly learn that the mouthpiece of the gods cannot be silenced so easily.

\columnbreak

<br>

### Zunk's Tactics
Zunk prioritizes staying stationary to maximize the effectiveness of his Mumbo Jumbo Dance, targeting the ally with the highest number of spirits and hit points. He keeps his familiar close to utilize its Strange Portent and Absorb Spell abilities on himself for added protection.

***Primal Portent.***
Zunk only engages in combat when all the creatures he is bound to are present. When activating this ability, he imbues the creature with the highest hit points (as long as it is not incapacitated). This forces opponents to switch targets frequently due to the shared resistance among bound creatures.

#### Action Priorities
Zunk follows a specific set of actions based on the battlefield situation:

**Wild Surge.** Targets the strongest bound creature. If he loses concentration, he will recast it, prioritizing the creature with the most beast spirits on it.

**Brutal Glare.** Used when he can affect either two low-Dexterity targets or three or more enemies. If possible, he casts this at 3rd level.

**Bone Cracker.** Used when he is already concentrating on Wild Surge and there are no tightly grouped enemies.

## Ju-ju Beasts
*Weird Loci of Primal Power*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Hills, Mountains, Underdark; **Treasure:** None

Gripped tightly in the meaty hands of an orcish spellcaster or wrapped around their knotted arms, the baffling ju-ju beast is a creature of strange power and unknown origins. These tiny anomalies have no common appearance—some resemble bloated, round clay balls with two legs and a mouth full of needle-like teeth, while others take the form of scowling, toad-like creatures with colorful plumes of feathers sprouting from their heads. Others still are long and sinuous, similar to snakes, with waxy orange and yellow skin and saber-like fangs jutting from their mouths.

What all ju-ju beasts share is an innate attraction to concentrations of primordial magic, which often brings them into contact with orc shamans. Many end up as companions to these mystics, drawn by their magic-rich auras. Some shamans even perform rituals, infusing bones or meat with enchantments to use as bait to lure these creatures into their service.

Once bound to a shaman, a ju-ju beast becomes a conduit for magic. When gripped and squeezed firmly, the creature allows its master to draw in vast amounts of weirdling power, enhancing spellcasting and even granting brief glimpses into the future, warning them of imminent danger. The beasts can even absorb magic from enemy casters through their bodies, channeling it back into their wielder to amplify their abilities.

The relationship between a ju-ju beast and its master is as bizarre and capricious as the creature itself. Their effect on an orc shaman’s mind is poorly understood, but many believe they have a diluting or warping influence on their wielder’s thoughts. Some shamans treat their ju-ju beasts as beloved pets, pampering them—only to one day crush or dismember them in ritual sacrifice or to create potent magical paints. Others believe that they and their beasts are one and the same entity, speaking only in the first-person plural.

Stranger still, some shamans claim to receive guidance from their ju-ju beasts, though there has never been any tangible evidence of these creatures possessing higher intellect. Nevertheless, such advice is taken with complete solemnity and cannot be challenged by other members of the tribe—not even the chieftain. Held as sacred truths, these pronouncements can lead shamans to order their tribes to undertake baffling tasks or even wage war based on their supposed whispered counsel.

### Ju-ju Beast Tactics
A ju-ju beast is usually accompanied by a spellcaster, serving as their spell focus. It uses Strange Portent on the creature holding it while reserving Absorb Spell for any incoming spell that deals more than 10 damage.

> ### Traits
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The ju-ju beast has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Ju-ju Conduit.*** Any creature grappling the ju-ju beast can use it as a spellcasting focus.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
>
> ***Strange Portent.*** The ju-ju beast chooses one creature that is in the same space as it. Until the start of the ju-ju beast’s next turn, that creature is under the effects of the *bless* spell while it remains in the same space as the ju-ju beast.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Absorb Spell.*** If the ju-ju beast is subjected to a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw and only half damage if it fails. If it succeeds, it can choose itself or another creature within 5 feet. The first time the chosen creature hits with an attack on its next turn, the target takes an extra 5 (2d4) force damage.


>***Ju-ju Beast Familiars.*** The ju-ju beast can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the juju beast senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other.
