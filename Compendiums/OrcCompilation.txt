# Orc Compendium

The orcs are a race of savage, muscle-bound barbarians who live for the thrill of battle. Towering over many other races, their hulking forms are a testament to their belief in brute strength as the highest virtue. Orc society is built around combat, and they are always eager to prove their might. This insatiable thirst for violence often leads to constant brawling among their own clans, turning their encampments into chaotic battlegrounds.

Despite their fractious nature, the orcs' relentless fighting spirit can be harnessed by powerful leaders who manage to unite the clans under a single banner. These leaders, often the most formidable and cunning of their kind, can forge disparate groups into mighty war hosts. When united, these orcish armies become an unstoppable force, rivaling the military might of other, more organized races.

Orc weaponry reflects their brutal approach to warfare. Their weapons are crude and especially heavy, designed to maximize the sheer force behind each strike. Regardless of the type—whether axe, polearm, or longbow—these weapons are collectively known as "choppers." Orcs wield these cumbersome instruments with terrifying proficiency, their immense strength allowing them to deliver devastating opening blows that can shatter enemy lines and send foes fleeing in terror.

\columnbreak

Yet, in spite of their course and direct natures, orcs are deeply superstitious. They see signs and portents in every strange occurrence, convinced these are messages from their gods. Any event that deviates from the norm—a sudden thunderclap, an unexpected solar eclipse—is taken as a divine omen. Likewise, those orcs who appear to harness the will of the gods, known as shamans, command enormous respect. Their mysterious rituals and ability to channel supernatural energies mark them as blessed figures who interpret the gods’ intentions for the tribe. Orcs flock to these shamans for guidance, trusting that each incantation or cryptic vision shapes their destiny.

While their society may appear to be in perpetual chaos, it is precisely this endless conflict that molds them into formidable warriors. Strength is the sole currency in orcish culture, ensuring only the mightiest survive. Those who ascend to leadership status emerge as titans of orcish power, backed by warriors hardened through ceaseless skirmishes. Whether locked in a fierce clan brawl or marching in a unified war host, orcs exhibit a unique resilience in the face of defeat. Their chaotic nature—lacking rigid hierarchies and bound by the rule of strength—allows them to rebuild quickly after even the most devastating losses. Rival factions step in to fill power vacuums, seasoned fighters return to the fore, and shamans rally the survivors with renewed fervor, ensuring that the orcs always stand ready to fight once more for the glory of their gods.

## Choppers

Choppers are crude and hefty weapons favored by many orcish clans. An orc's strength allows them to wield these weapons with brutal efficiency, whereas many other species would struggle to even lift them. Although they can deliver devastating blows, their bulky nature makes them cumbersome to wield. Orcs refer to any weapon with these traits as a chopper, whether a massive war maul or a mighty longbow requiring tremendous strength to draw.

### Chopper Weapon Trait
Any weapon can have the Chopper trait added to it, which grants it the following features:

* If it has the Finesse or Thrown properties, it loses them.

* When a creature makes an attack for the first time on its turn with a Chopper weapon, it gets a -1 penalty on that attack roll and deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

* The weapon gains the Heavy trait, if it doesn't already have it and, the weapon's weight is doubled.

\columnbreak

* Attacks made with the weapon suffer disadvantage due to its hefty nature unless the creature wielding it has a Strength score of 13 or higher.

### New Feat: Chopper Master
*Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher*<br>
You've mastered the savage art of wielding choppers and their weight now helps rather than hinders you. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you make an attack for the first time on your turn with a Chopper weapon, you get a +1 bonus to the attack instead of a -1 penalty.

## Orcish Magic Items
While orcs aren't known for their master craftsmanship, they still find a way of getting their hands on magic items that reflect their brutal nature. These are generally items blessed by their most powerful shamans, cobbled together from the artifacts of other races, or simply infused with psychic emanations of their aggression. 

All of the magic weapons listed here have the "chopper" trait, which is described on the last page of the document.

#### Axe of the Last War
*Weapon (greataxe chopper), rare (requires attunement), 6,000gp*

*A sacred object to orcs and a subject of prophecy. Any who bring this axe into battle will find that the weapon becomes more difficult to control as the conflict rages on. It is said that one day, the mightiest orc warrior to have ever lived will take up the weapon and begin a rampage that will cascade into a war that ends the world.*

Instead of dealing an extra 1d4 damage on a hit when you make your first attack each turn, this chopper deals an extra 1d8 damage.

When you roll initiative, you can choose to have the weapon gain a level of power whenever you take the attack action on your turn until combat ends. The weapon can gain a maximum of 3 levels of power. For each level of power, the weapon has, it gains a -1 penalty to attack rolls and deals an additional 1d8 damage on hit.

While the weapon has any levels of power, you cannot be disarmed of the weapon or drop it.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



#### Big Kicking Boots
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement), 1,000gp*

*These boots once belonged to a ferocious orc warlord known for knocking down any foe that crossed his path. He eventually met his match when he attempted to kick an ancient dragon that blocked his way. After a blast of fire, only his boots were left when the smoke cleared. It is said that his might and stench still cling to them to this day.*

When you make an attack for the first time on your turn, if it is an unarmed strike, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll, and it deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit. If the attack is a shove, you gain a +1 bonus to your Strength (Athletics) check, and if you win, you can push the creature back 5 feet and knock it prone.

#### The Big Smasher
*Weapon (maul chopper), rare (requires attunement), 4,000 gp*

*Originally stolen from a dwarven stronghold by orc marauders, this weapon has since been modified by its new owners. The weapon is now spoken of with disdain and fear among dwarven kind, and many orc warriors wielding this weapon have broken through entire regiments of dwarf soldiers.*

While wielding this weapon, you can use your action to make a melee attack against each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you, with a separate attack roll for each target. Each attack made this way suffers the chopper’s -1 penalty to attack rolls and deals an additional 1d4 damage on a hit.

#### Gut Slasher
*Weapon (greataxe chopper), very rare (requires attunement), 16,000 gp*

*This black metal axe is dotted with permanent splatters of crimson and crude orcish talismans chained and bolted to its haft. All of these have been acquired over a long, violent existence. One who bears this weapon is filled with an urge for violence that propels them into battle faster than most opponents can mount a proper defense.*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Additionally, during the first round of combat, you can choose to take your turn on initiative count 22 instead of your normal initiative (losing ties). If you do, you can only use your action to take the Attack action, making attacks with this weapon on that turn, and you can't cast spells during that turn.

#### Iron Gnashers
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement), 1,000gp*

*Whenever this large metal jaw plate is donned, the wearer is overcome with excessive bloodlust.*

While wearing this jaw plate, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with it. It counts as a simple melee weapon with the chopper rule for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit, and the attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

#### Seeking Chopper
*Weapon (greataxe chopper), rare (requires attunement), 4,000gp*

*This crudely made axe seems to bear its own murderous cunning, able to nudge itself just enough to turn what would be a failed strike into a bloody success.*

When you make the first attack on your turn, if you miss and the attack was made with this weapon, you can reroll it. You must use this new roll and you may only make attacks with this weapon for the rest of the turn.

#### Spiteful Shield
*Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement), 1,000gp*

*This round shield has a sharp snaggletooth mouth stretched across it in an unpleasant frown; any foes that fumble their attacks too close will regret their misstep*

While you wield this shield, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you rolls a 1 on an attack roll, you can have the shield deal 4d8 piercing damage to that creature.


#### Staff of Wild Weirding 
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer), 2,400 gp*

*Created by an unorthodox and ambitious orc shaman obsessed with channeling destructive levels of primal magic through himself, this battered, misshapen staff was his final exploit. Those who use the staff to tap into the raw winds of magic can only hope to be more fortunate than its creator.*

While attuned to this staff, you can channel its power to gather the winds of magic.  This can be done as a bonus action or whenever you roll for initiative.  When you do so, the staff gains 1d6 charges, which last for 1 minute or until you expend them.  

\columnbreak

If you roll a 1, you gain no charges and must roll on the Miscast Table below to determine what kind of magical backlash you suffer. 

You can't roll for charges again until you spend a 10-minute ritual with the staff, which you can do during a short or long rest.

While the staff has charges, you can expend charges as though they were sorcery points, except they can't be converted into spell slots.


 ##### Miscast Table
| 1d6 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  | Miscast Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  1  |   You surge with unstable power that can't be contained. You and each creature in a 15-foot-wide, 120-foot-long line originating from you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 6d6 force damage and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. You have disadvantage on the saving throw.|
|  2  | Sudden pulses of energy cause you to move spastically and expel fountains of raw destruction. For the next minute, you are incapacitated, and on each of your turns, you use your movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8. After moving, you spew energy in a 30-foot cone in a direction of your choice. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.|
|  3  |   	Your consciousness seeks to anchor itself to another. You and another willing creature you can see within 60 feet are under the effects of the *warding bond* spell for the next hour. While under this effect, you can speak telepathically to each other. If the effect ends early or there are no willing creatures within range, you take 6d8 psychic damage.|
|  4  |  Your mind begins to split, unleashing agonizing thoughts that tear apart all they touch. At the start of each of your turns, you and another creature of your choice that you are aware of within 30 feet of you must make DC 15 Intelligence saving throws, taking 3d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At the end of each of your turns, roll a d6; on a 1 or 2, the effect ends.|
|  5  |    	Your mind is ravaged by chaotic magic, leading you into a frenzied rampage. For the next 10 minutes, you are berserk (condition described on the next page). Your Strength score becomes 20, and your staff deals an extra 3d6 force damage to any target you hit with it.|
| 6   | The staff becomes overloaded, and you gain 7 charges. The staff can't regain charges until the next dawn.|

#### Sword of Screaming Insults
*Weapon (greatsword chopper), rare (requires attunement), 4,000 gp*

*The sword bears a peculiar enchantment that causes the user's voice to become as sharp as the blade, able to cut down foes just as well.*

While wielding this sword, you can use an action to cast the *vicious mockery* spell with it. The spell save DC is equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma modifier.

Moreover, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast a cantrip in place of one of your attacks made with this weapon.

#### Orc-Blessed Armour
*Armor (plate), rare, 4,000 gp*

*This plate armor was made from sheets of metal hacked off from various suits of enchanted armor that were taken from a myriad of slain foes and welded together by orcish magic. As burdensome as the armor is, it grants the wear the aggression and tenacity of the mightiest orc.*

While wearing this armor, you can use your bonus action to gain 5 temporary hit points, and you may move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this movement closer to the enemy than when you started.

*Many orc bosses of the past owe their decisive victories not to their cunning strategy or leadership but to a well-timed blow of this horn that can rally even the most wary allies and unsettle even the most emboldened foes.*

You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and blow the horn, which emits a sound audible up to 600 feet away. When you do so, you can designate any number of creatures within 100 feet of you. Each chosen creature can end any conditions that are frightening them. Each other creature within 100 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the next minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
The horn can't be used this way again until the next dawn.




<br>

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
> * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.

### Savage Orc Magic Items
If orcish craftsmanship is considered crude by the standards of other races, the savage orcs' crafting abilities are simply barbaric. Their items are carved from wood and bone or ripped straight from the natural world. However, they carry a primal power the civilized races could never hope to harness. Through shamanistic rituals and raw belief in their power, the orcs are able to infuse these crude items with savage power beyond the comprehension of a logical mind.

All of the magic weapons listed here have the "chopper" trait, which is described on the last page of the document.

#### Baleful Mask
*Wondrous item, very rare, (requires attunement by a druid, bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard), 16,000gp*

*This rough wooden visage, saturated with ancient power, once belonged to an orc prophet whose deeds have been lost to time. Those who don this mask become infused with psionic energy, their eyes glowing green through its rough-hewn sockets. With a mere glance, the wearer can unleash bolts of disintegrating magic or crush the minds of their foes.*

This mask has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without any Verbal components, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: *brain burster* (1 charge), *brutal glare* (2 charges) or *psychic headbutt* (4 charges).

When you cast a spell with the mask, you can spend 1 additional charge to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting.

#### Bonewood Staff
*Staff (arcane or druidic focus), very rare <br> (requires attunement by a spellcaster),  6,000 gp*

*Etched with a myriad of Orcish glyphs of war, this staff not only shields its wielder but also enables them to unleash devastating magic while delivering bone-crushing blows with its hefty form*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

In addition, whenever you cast a first or higher-level spell while wielding this staff, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.

#### Frost Basher
*Weapon (greatclub chopper), uncommon (requires attunement), 1,000 gp*

*This translucent club of rough-hewn ice was chiseled from a massive glacier by the savage orcish tribe that dwells in its shadow. Those struck by this weapon feel their blood begin to freeze within their veins.*

The weapon deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. When you make your first attack with this weapon on your turn and hit a creature, it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain disadvantage this way.

#### Orcish War Paint
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement)  2,000 gp*

*Inks are crafted by the most devoted orcish shamans, who believe that colors hold innate power and can enhance an orc when applied to the body. So certain are these mystics of this truth that the tattoos they etch manifest real power.*

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

##### Black War Paint

*Symbol of resilience (orcs believe wearing black makes you harder to kill).*

Your Constitution score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Constitution is already 19 or higher. Additionally, whenever you regain hit points, treat any rolled dice as having rolled their maximum value.

##### Blue War Paint

*Symbol of cunning and luck (orcs believe blue is the color of protection).*

Your Intelligence score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher. Additionally, you gain a +1 bonus to ability checks, saving throws, and AC.

##### Purple War Paint

*Symbol of stealth and invisibility (orcs claim that no one has ever seen a purple orc).*

Your Dexterity score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Dexterity is already 19 or higher. Additionally, as an action, you can turn invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

##### Red War Paint

*Symbol of speed and brutality (orcs believe that anything red moves faster).*

Your Strength score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Strength is already 19 or higher. Additionally, you have advantage on initiative rolls, and when you roll initiative, you are quickened (condition described at end of document) until the end of your next turn.

##### White War Paint

*Symbol of death and fearlessness (orcs associate white with the intent to kill).*

Your Wisdom score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Wisdom is already 19 or higher. Additionally, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. If you score a critical hit on a creature that has 30 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, it drops to 0 hit points.

##### Yellow War Paint

*Symbol of wealth and power (orcs also believe yellow things make better explosions).*

Your Charisma score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Charisma is already 19 or higher. Additionally, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that can be upcast to deal additional damage dice (such as *fireball* or *inflict wounds*), you can increase the spell’s effective level by 1.

#### Pike of the Beast
*Weapon (pike chopper), very rare (requires attunement), 3,000 gp*

*This pike has been wielded in countless great hunts throughout the ages, felling myriad deadly beasts. Its staff is adorned with numerous trophies—teeth, claws, and hides—claimed from each conquest. The shaft constantly shifts with primitive pictographs, revealing crude depictions of these battles. Those who grasp this weapon become suffused with the spiritual might of the fallen creatures.*

At dawn each day, roll on the Beast Spirit table. The weapon gains the corresponding effect until the next dawn.

##### Beast Spirit
| d6  | Spirit |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Boar.*** When you hit a creature with your first weapon attack on your turn using this weapon, the target is knocked prone if it is Large or smaller. |
|  2  | ***Triceratops.*** When you hit a creature with your first weapon attack on your turn, the target becomes disrupted until the end of your next turn. While disrupted, it can't gain the benefits of the Disengage or Dodge action, and if it is within 10 feet of you, it has disadvantage on all attack rolls. |
|  3  | ***Rhino.*** When you hit a creature with your first melee weapon attack on your turn using this weapon, the target is impaled. An impaled target is grappled (escape DC 15). While impaling a creature, the weapon can't be used to attack other targets. If you release the weapon, the grapple ends.|
|  4  | ***Mammoth.*** When you make your first weapon attack on your turn using this weapon, hit or miss, the target and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of it takes 5 thunder damage.
|  6  | ***Tyrannosaurus.*** When you hit a creature with your first weapon attack on your turn using this weapon, you inflict two wounds on the creature. |
|  2  | ***Wolf.*** When you hit a creature with your first weapon attack on your turn, the target becomes exposed until the end of your next turn. While exposed, your allies have advantage on attack rolls against it if you are within 10 feet of you.

#### Spike Spitter
*Weapon (longbow chopper), very rare (requires attunement), 2,000 gp*

*This heavy bow, fashioned from the horn of a titanic rhino, channels the beast's raw power. If the wielder fires an arrow while running, it will strike with the force of a charging behemoth.*

When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, if you moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before making the attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 damage on a hit.

#### Zapper Wand
*Wand,  very rare (requires attunement by a Spellcaster),  1000 gp*

*This clunky, battered flint spike has been passed down for generations from one savage shaman to the next. Those who wield this weathered wand find that their incantations gain a powerful kickback.*

When you make a spell attack for the first time each turn while holding this wand, you gain a -1 bonus on the attack roll, and it deals an extra 2d4 damage on a hit of the damage type dealt by the spell (if there are multiple damage types, you choose which).

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
> 
>  * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
>  * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
>  * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

# New Spells

## Lore of Beasts
This brand of magic draws on the power of the wilds and the animals that inhabit them. Those who practice it avoid civilization and live hermitic lives in the savage and untamed wilderness. Their magic harnesses the power of the beasts they dwell alongside, often by summoning wild spirits or unleashing the inner savagery of themselves and others to transform them into primeval creatures. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Beasts often wield.

#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

#### Aspect of the Beast

*4th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

#### Call of the Pack

*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Ranger
___

Unleashing a primal howl, you stir the wild fervor within your allies. You and up to three other creatures you are aware of within range that can hear you are quickened until the start of your next turn. While quickened this way, these creatures gain advantage on attack rolls against any enemy if at least one of their allies is within 5 feet of that enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### Impenetrable Pelt

*5th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1  action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a tuft of fur)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You weave magic to sheathe a willing creature you can see within range in a layer of tough fur and hide. For the spell's duration, any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 5. This reduction applies before any resistances.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage reduction increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  10 minutes
- **Classes:**   Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You emanate a commanding presence, compelling a primal creature to submit. Choose a beast, monstrosity, giant, dragon, or fey within range that can see and hear you. If the creature's Intelligence is 8 or higher, the spell has no effect. Otherwise, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes charmed and frightened by you until the end of your next turn. Regardless of the save's outcome, you gain a +5 bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) and Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with that creature until the spell concludes.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 2d4 piercing damage. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is blinded until the start of your next turn. Regardless of the outcome, the directed crow is expended. The spell ends if all crows are expended. For each crow circling above you, you gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.


***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot or higher, you summon an additional crow for each slot level above 1st.

## Lore of Orcs
This magic is commonly used by orcish war <br> shamans who draw psychic power from the <br> aggression of brutal combat. Much of it is psionic <br> in nature and specializes  in disrupting other enemy spellcasters and enhancing the combat powers of <br> the caster and their allies. Orcish shamans believe <br> these powers are drawn from the spirit  of their war <br> gods, and the most powerful of these spells seem to <br> even partially manifest their god's presence on the <br> battlefield. The following spells are examples of the <br> types of magic users of this orcish magic wield, though, depending on the setting, these spells could be utilized by other races as well.

####  Brain Burster
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d8 psychic  damage, and until the end of your next turn, it has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma  checks, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration. 
Additionally, if the creature  attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher before the end of your next turn, it must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot or other resource, the slot or resource isn’t expended.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

####  Brutal Glare
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You fixate on two points within the spell's range, no more than 30 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of glowing force erupt from your eyes, blazing between the two points. Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 force damage. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d10, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Foot of The Gods
*7th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer

You call forth a massive foot from the heavens to crash down onto the battlefield. You select a point you can see, between 30 to 500 feet above you within range. A 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide foot appears at the chosen point and immediately descends. The foot passes through any Huge or smaller creatures and objects until it descends 500 feet or hits a solid surface, or a Gargantuan creature or object, at which point the foot rises back up into the sky to where its descent started. As an action on your turn, you can move the foot up to 30 feet, rotate it, and then have the foot descend in the same way.

Each creature or object the foot comes in contact with while descending must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so. The creature is also pushed along with the foot until it rises back up. If a creature that fails the saving throw is already prone, it takes an additional 2d12 bludgeoning damage.

####  Here We Go!
*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action.
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Paladin, Ranger, Warlock

You chant, imbuing yourself and up to four creatures you can see with fighty energy. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you or a creature you chose misses with an unarmed strike or weapon attack roll, you may have it reroll the attack. The creature must use the new roll.

#### Mind Spike (Revised)
*2nd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Choose one creature that you have seen or heard within the last minute. If that creature is within range, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Additionally, on a failed save, you always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Psychic Headbutt
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

A disruptive bolt of energy emanates from your head toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. The attack has advantage and cannot have disadvantage if the target is concentrating on a spell. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage. If the creature makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, you may choose to set the saving throw DC equal to your spell save DC.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.




#### Savage Fists
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Druid, Ranger

Your fists become as hard as iron, and you are filled with fighting fury. When you cast this spell, you make an unarmed strike and gain the following benefits for the duration of the spell:

* You can use your spellcasting modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

* You can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

* You may use your spellcasting modifier when making Strength checks instead of your Strength modifier.

#  Orcish <br> Forces

## Orc Shamans
Orc shamans are the strange, revered spiritual leaders of orcish society, believed to channel the raw will of their gods. Unlike most orcs, whose strength lies in brute force, shamans wield the unpredictable and violent magic of the orcish pantheon. Their role as intermediaries between the mortal realm and the gods makes them both respected and feared, for their powers are mysterious and often uncontrollable. As the orcs wage war, the shamans draw upon the aggressive psychic energy that permeates the battlefield, fueled by the bloodlust of their kin. To the orcs, war is the highest form of worship, and it is through this divine carnage that the shamans perform their most powerful feats of magic.

The magic wielded by orc shamans is chaotic and devastating. They can unleash blasts of psychic energy capable of bursting the brains of their enemies or driving other orcs into even greater heights of bloodthirsty violence. In some cases, shamans are able to summon the wrath of the gods themselves, such as calling forth a giant spectral foot to crush their foes—a manifestation of the gods' direct intervention. This violent magic makes shamans formidable on the battlefield, and they often lead orc warbands into battle with a fervor unmatched by any warrior, their very presence stoking the bloodlust of the horde around them.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, the connection to their gods often leaves orc shamans exhibiting strange and awkward behaviors that make other orcs uncomfortable. While the shamans are powerful, their bizarre mannerisms—such as babbling incoherently, emitting strange noises, or randomly dancing around while flapping their arms—are seen as eccentric at best. Orcs, who prize straightforward strength and aggression, often don’t know how to react to these odd displays. Despite this, shamans are tolerated, as their magical abilities and perceived favor from the gods make them too valuable to dismiss. While other orcs might roll their eyes or grumble under their breath at a shaman’s antics, they know better than to voice their discomfort openly. The power these shamans wield far outweighs their odd behavior, and their connection to the orcish gods demands a level of respect, however begrudging.

### Orc Shaman Tactics

Orc shamans focus on using their spells to disrupt other spell casters, limit enemy movement, and grant boosts to the combat powers of their allies. They should stay close to their allies in combat to gain the boost to their War Channeler trait.

#### Spell Usage

&emsp;**Stomping Foot:** Great opening move to force grouped enemies to spread out into unfavorable positions. Focus on prone creatures to gain bonus damage. Minions should use the shove action on their turns to knock creatures prone.

**Here We Go!:** Cast immediately if there are companions of CR 2 or higher and if it can hit two or more targets with the Stomping Foot spell. Definitely cast if there is an orc boss or warboss among the group.

**Arcane Hand:** If *foot of the gods* is not available, use this concentration spell. Primarily used to grab backline opponents and drag them into melee combat.

**Headbutt:** Use to break the concentration of enemy spellcasters. Priority over all other spells if an opposing spellcaster is concentrating on a higher-level spell than the Shaman can cast.

**Brain Burster:** Use frequently to disrupt enemy spellcasters.

**Brutal Glare:** Use whenever you can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity and do not have a 5th or higher level spell available.

**Savage Fists:** Use when the lesser orc shaman has been cornered in combat.

## Savage <Br> Orc Shamans
*Bizarre Practitioners of Primal Magics*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Hills, <Br> Mountains, Underdark; <br>**Treasure:** Individual, Relics <br>
Adorned with bizarre trinkets crudely carved from <bR> bone  and wood, their arms lined with dozens of bangles, <br> and their bodies streaked with outlandish tattoos, the savage orc shaman is an unmistakable figure. Their heads are crowned with towering feathered headdresses or gnarled ceremonial masks, making them impossible to overlook.

Yet, beyond their bombastic appearance, savage orc shamans demand attention through their wild antics—performing ritualistic dances, babbling in tongues, or scattering strange mystical dust and peculiar charms throughout their surroundings. These eccentric displays are far more bizarre and last much longer than the rituals of their more conventional orcish counterparts.

While regular orcs might find such behavior off-putting or even embarrassing, savage orc tribes revere their shamans, viewing their spasming prophets with religious awe. No one, not even the mightiest orcish warboss, dares to challenge the authority of a savage orc shaman. These holy conduits provide the tribe’s warriors with sacred war paints, which render those who bear them nearly impervious to attack.

Beyond this, the shamans are seen as direct voices of the gods. When even a shred of tangible wisdom or meaning can be deciphered from their incoherent ramblings, the tribe treats it as absolute gospel—indisputable and sacred. And when a shaman's addled mind suddenly fixates on a goal, they will pursue it with unyielding determination, leading their devoted followers in relentless pursuit of their divine vision.

When battle erupts, a tribe led by a savage orc shaman becomes a force to be reckoned with. The raw, truculent energies that fuel orcish spellcasting are even more potent among savage orcs, allowing their shamans to harness immense power for their devastating incantations.

As the conflict rages, the shaman appears lost in its own wild antics, seemingly oblivious to the chaos around it. However, enemies who mistake this for foolishness soon realize the truth—these bizarre acts emanate maddening energy that grips nearby orcs, driving them into a frenzy. This unrelenting madness only further amplifies the shaman’s destructive spells.

### Beast Shamans
Among the Savage Orcs, some tribes still hunt primeval titans in the name of their gods. Many shamans craft sacred icons from the horns and tusks of these mighty beasts, adorning themselves with these relics to channel spells of bestial might.

Some shamans who follow this path can empower their followers with spectral claws and fangs, while others unleash howling cries that awaken a feral bloodlust within their allies. A rare few possess the ability to transform into primordial monsters, swatting aside their foes with raw power.

### Orc Shaman Tactics

Orc shamans focus on using their spells to disrupt other spell casters, limit enemy movement, and grant boosts to the combat powers of their allies. They should stay close to their allies in combat to gain the boost to their War Channeler trait. They should avoid unnecessary movement so they can maintain their Mumbo Jumbo Dance, as any attack actions made with the quicked condition contribute to their War Channeler ability.

#### Default Spell Usage

&emsp;**Stomping Foot:** Great opening move to force grouped enemies to spread out into unfavorable positions. Focus on prone creatures to gain bonus damage. Minions should use the shove action on their turns to knock creatures prone.

**Here We Go!:** Cast immediately if there are companions of CR 2 or higher and if it can hit two or more targets with the Stomping Foot spell. Definitely cast if there is an orc boss or warboss among the group.

**Arcane Hand:** If *foot of the gods* is not available, use this concentration spell. Primarily used to grab backline opponents and drag them into melee combat.

**Headbutt:** Use to break the concentration of enemy spellcasters. Priority over all other spells if an opposing spellcaster is concentrating on a higher-level spell than the Shaman can cast.

**Brain Burster:** Use frequently to disrupt enemy spellcasters.

**Brutal Glare:** Use whenever you can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity and do not have a 5th or higher level spell available.

\columnbreak

&emsp; **Savage Fists:** Use when the lesser orc shaman has been cornered in combat.

#### Beast Shaman Spell Usage

**Pass Without Trace:** Ideally cast before combat begins to avoid detection.

**Aspect of the Beast:** Typically cast on the orc’s most powerful ally. Ripping Jaws is generally the most effective option for orcs.

**Howl of the Pack:** Used on the second turn, after all savage orcs are no longer quickened.

**Amber Spear:** Best cast when there’s an opportunity to hit two or more targets.

**Primal Dominance:**  The shaman will use this spell whenever a valid target is available.

**Heroism:** Can be used to bolster either other orcs or the shaman themselves.

**Monstrous Transformation:** Activated when the shaman’s health drops below half, and once transformed, it rarely reverts to its original form mid-combat. While the transformed shaman cannot cast spells, any ongoing magical effects remain active. 

Possible transformations include:

* **Manticore:** Preferred when enemies lack strong ranged attacks.
* **Hydra:** Chosen against foes with low damage output or those unable to concentrate attacks on the transformed orc.
* **Dragon:** Ideal when enemies are grouped together, allowing the dragon’s breath to strike multiple targets. Also useful against foes with high elemental damage.

## Orc Infantry

Orcish infantry form the savage heart of any orc war host, defined by their raw ferocity and brute physical might. Towering over many foes, these imposing foot soldiers storm the battlefield with colossal, crudely fashioned weapons—testaments to their insatiable thirst for violence. Though they lack the tight formations seen in more structured armies, orcish infantry make up for it with sheer power and vicious cunning, overwhelming adversaries in relentless assaults.

Despite a seemingly haphazard approach, orc warriors fight with a fierce cohesion when motivated by a commanding warlord or the promise of bloodshed. Their ranks seethe with brawlers, each eager to prove that they can strike the hardest and endure the longest. Even the most rudimentary training takes the form of brutal contests, where new scars and trophies elevate one’s standing in the clan.

Many orcs live for close-quarters mayhem, but archers also play a vital role in orcish warbands. These bow-wielding brutes hew their massive arrows from raw timber, launching them with such force that they can pierce armor or upend charging cavalry. Although less numerous than their melee-focused kin, orc archers add a lethal edge to any assault, raining death upon foes before the front lines clash.

Equipped with an assortment of heavy “choppers”—from jagged axes to weighty polearms—orcish infantry rely on overwhelming offense instead of refined defense. Their armor, often crudely cobbled from salvaged steel or thick hides, offers minimal protection but ensures unbridled mobility. Emboldened by their unrelenting aggression, these foot soldiers tear deep into enemy lines, forcing even disciplined warriors to scatter in terror. Whether locked in chaotic clan brawls or banding together under a single banner, orcish infantry embody the brutal, unyielding spirit of a race that thrives on carnage.

### Orc Brutes

Orc brutes epitomize orcish strength and savagery. Towering over their kin, these hulking warriors bear muscles and scars from countless battles. Born with a natural advantage in size and ferocity, they swiftly rise through the brutal ranks of orc society by sheer force, seizing power and commanding respect from lesser orcs.

Driven by a relentless need to prove their superiority, orc brutes often lead the vanguard in battle, wielding devastating choppers and inspiring their kin with displays of raw might. Their unyielding aggression and towering presence make them indispensable in warbands, serving as both enforcers of the warlord’s will and motivators for their fellow warriors, who dare not challenge such formidable leaders.

As the backbone of any formidable war host, these giants shape the tide of battle with unbreakable will and overwhelming power. Their ability to endure punishing blows while dishing out equally devastating force allows them to grind down even the most resilient foes, making them invaluable assets in prolonged conflicts. ​

### Orc Archers

Orc archers, known for their surprising skill with longbows, occupy a peculiar niche within orc society. These sharpshooters are often viewed with suspicion and distrust by their kin, as most orcs consider ranged combat sneaky and cowardly. Despite this disdain, the practical value of orc archers cannot be denied. Their ability to rain down a hail of arrows on enemies from a distance provides a tactical advantage even the most battle-hungry orc bosses recognize.

While orc archers are generally tolerated for their utility, they are also keenly aware of the contempt their brethren hold for them. Insults and slights are rarely made within earshot, as tales abound of those who dared to mock an archer only to be found later with an arrow through their neck. This underlying tension creates a volatile environment where orc archers must constantly prove their worth and strength, both on the battlefield and within their own ranks, ensuring that they remain a force to be reckoned with despite the disdain of their fellow orcs.

### Orc Hole Puncher
Orc hole punchers are a fearsome subset of orc archers, distinguished by their use of especially heavy and powerful longbows. These massive weapons require immense draw strength, something only the most robust and skilled orcs can muster. The arrows fired by hole punchers strike with incredible power, capable of piercing through armor and even shields, making them a deadly threat on the battlefield.

The reputation of orc hole punchers extends beyond their physical prowess. Their ability to deliver devastating shots from a distance earns them a grudging respect even from those who disdain ranged combat. While they share the general mistrust faced by all orc archers, their undeniable effectiveness ensures they are valued members of any war host. The orcs know that underestimating a hole puncher can be a fatal mistake, as these powerful archers can turn the tide of battle with a well-placed, bone-shattering shot.

#### Orc Soldier Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs. 

##### Orcs and Orc Brutes
&emsp;**Aggressive:** Utilize their aggressive trait to bypass front lines and target vulnerable backline characters.

**Choppers:** Their first attack bonus makes them effective against high AC targets with low hit points, maximizing initial impact.

##### Orc Archers and Hole Punchers

&emsp;**Positioning:** Maintain distance to engage vulnerable targets with ranged attacks.

**Tactical Movement:** In ranged firefights, use the Aggressive trait to close distances and engage in melee, overwhelming opposing ranged attackers.

**Pre-Melee Action (Hole Puncher only):** Before moving into melee, use their *Devastating Draw* ability, if available, to maximize damage output.

When the orc makes an attack with the drawn weapon, that attack consumes the draw and gains a +1 bonus to hit and deals an additional 9 (2d8) damage on a hit.

## Savage Orc Infantry
*Primitive Warriors of Primal Faith*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Hills, Mountains, Underdark; **Treasure:** Armaments, Individual

In the distant past, all orcs lived by primeval means, using crude clubs and spears carved from bone, stone, and wood. Their height of technology was the rudimentary bow and arrow. They roamed the land, hunting colossal beasts and marauding any people they encountered. As the tribes coalesced into mighty hordes to wage war against the civilized world, they learned the secrets of metalwork, clad themselves in armor, and forged axes and swords. However, some orcs in remote regions did not advance, while others rejected these technologies, deeming them un-Orcish. These tribes became known as Savage Orcs, and they are dedicated to the traditions and ways of their ancestors.

Savage orcs adorn their bodies with crude war paint, often wearing little else. They wield makeshift flint and bone clubs, remnants of their predecessors. Many believe them to be less threatening than their metal-clad kin due to the lack of refined weapons and armor, but this is far from the truth. Their savage nature and radical devotion to a primitive way of life fuel an unmatched battle frenzy. When combat begins, they surge forward at breakneck speed, swinging their crude cudgels with steel bone-crunching force. Even more alarming is their uncanny resilience—fueled by a zealous faith—that makes arrows and blades glance harmlessly off their war paint, as though striking solid stone.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

Savage orcs are rare, most often found in the world’s forgotten corners—primeval jungles, sun-scorched savannas, or frigid tundras—where they hunt monstrous beasts and fiercely repel any trespassers. Some venture far from their homelands to plunder, targeting sophisticated cultures that rely on advanced weaponry and intricate tactics. They take gleeful pride in dismantling these so-called “superior” civilizations, overturning carefully orchestrated plans with their wild, unpredictable onslaughts. At times, they may join larger warbands alongside regular orcs, yet they never fully adopt modern orc customs.

From the perspective of orc war bosses, savage orc mobs are hopeless when it comes to following orders; even the most basic directives leave them baffled. To regular orcs, savage orcs are crude and unruly—too feral by any standard—while savage orcs view their “civilized” kin as weak, overthinking, and overly dependent on tools instead of raw might. In their eyes, the old ways are still the best ways.

### Savage Orc Brutes
Savage orc brutes stand head and shoulders above their kin, radiating an even fiercer sense of savage superiority. Once they set their single-minded focus on a goal, virtually nothing can stop them. Their raw power and foul temper drive them to achieve their aims through sheer, brutal force.

\columnbreak

Lesser tribe members keep their distance, for one of the few things that can make a feral orc hesitate is the thought of provoking a Brute’s wrath. Yet this inspires no resentment or envy; to the tribe, Brutes are living symbols of orcish might, embodying a raw, ancestral strength that modern orcs have largely forgotten. Even fully armed orcs who witness these towering warriors charging across the battlefield, shrugging off blows that would fell an ordinary orc, can’t help but question their own reliance on armor and steel.

### Savage Orc Archer

Among regular orcs, those who rely on bows are considered sneaky or cowardly. However, in savage orc tribes, archers are surrounded by superstition and fear, rivaled only by the dread inspired by magic-wielders. Even the most basic bow is deemed a sophisticated weapon, and only the most disciplined Savage Orcs can resist the urge to charge into melee. This rare self-control is seen by their simpler-minded kin as near mystical.

These few disciplined archers are viewed with suspicion—even by the tribe’s brutish elites—because any orc who can keep his distance and strike from afar is regarded as highly unusual. Nevertheless, they are invaluable for taking down flying beasts or challenging foes who fight with projectile weapons. Though their bows are crude by most standards, a savage orc’s sheer muscle and ferocity can drive a flint-tipped arrow clean through thick hides or tough leather armor.

### Savage Orc Strikers
The greatest archers among the savage orcs are known as strikers, engaging in combat in the most unorthodox manner. These warriors have uniquely combined their natural orcish obsession with close-quarters combat and their skills in archery. When they spot a foe, they charge toward their prey at breakneck speed, unleashing a relentless barrage of arrows as they close the distance. The sheer anticipation of smashing their adversaries fuels their growing frenzy, causing them to fire with such devastating force that most enemies are already on the ground riddled with crude projectiles by the time the orc reaches them. 

Should the target, by some miracle, survive this deadly volley, they will soon find themselves bludgeoned with sturdy wooden bows and stabbed with flint-tipped arrows. Many orcish tribes or warbands derive great amusement from watching enemy forces mistakenly believe they are charging an unguarded artillery position, only to be ferociously counterattacked.

### Savage Orc Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs. 

#### Melee Infantry

Savage orcs eschew strategy in favor of charging headlong into battle, prioritizing their targets based on personal grudges or preferences. Some may focus on attacking enemies with advanced weaponry, such as an artificer, while others may seek out those they perceive as cowardly—like a wizard relying on illusion magic or a rogue attempting to disengage.

#### Savage Orc Archers

Savage orc archers are not the most tactical marksmen. Rather than retreating when enemies close in, they instinctively switch to their clubs, engaging in brutal melee combat once their foes are within reach.

#### Savage Orc Strikers

Savage orc strikers prioritize distant targets capable of attacking at range. They relentlessly advance, using their charge to gain bonus damage before engaging in melee once they reach their target.

## Big Stabbers

In ancient times, orcs hunted truly colossal behemoths—creatures of monumental size and ferocious temperament, their hides so thick that even orcs of primal disposition struggled to pierce them. Avoiding the wrath of an enraged titan in time was nearly impossible. However, despite their crude and straightforward thinking, the savage orcs devised a weapon specifically for felling these gargantuan beasts: the big stabber.

This massive spear features an outlandishly large, jagged flintstone point, nearly as tall as an orc itself. So unwieldy is this weapon that it requires two orcs to haul it into battle, gripping the long shaft tightly above their heads as they charge at full speed. Upon reaching their monstrous quarry, they drive the spear forward with the combined force of their momentum, brute strength, and deranged faith—enough to sunder even the toughest armor. When it gains full thrust, the big stabber can bring down an armored war elephant or maim even larger creatures.

Yet, for all its power, this rudimentary weapon is as unreliable as it is devastating. The flint spearhead is notoriously brittle, meaning the Big Stabber can typically only be used once or twice before it dulls or shatters—especially if an orc puts their full strength behind it. Additionally, its sheer size makes it highly predictable. A nimble opponent with decent reflexes can often sidestep the attack, causing the orcs wielding it to stumble and even trip over their own weapon.

Despite these drawbacks, big stabbers remain highly sought after by orcs outside the savage tribes, particularly in battles against armies that field monstrous cavalry. Strangely, even the most skilled orcish weapon makers outside these wild tribes seem incapable of creating stabbers as effective as those made by their primal kin, nor are they able to wield them to their full potential. For some unknowable reason, only the savage orcs possess the preternatural knowledge required to craft and wield these titan-slaying spears.

### Big Stabber Tactics
The big stabber always targets the largest creature in the area, with savage orcs putting as much force behind their attacks as possible. They will seize any opportunity to strike again, retreating briefly to reposition before lunging forward for another devastating stab—unless their weapon is already impaled in their target.

## Two-Creature Weapons Teams
Some weapons are so massive they require two creatures to move and operate them effectively. These weapons may be oversized firearms, large incendiary devices, or unwieldy melee weapons such as large drills. Though they come in many forms, they have a few common traits: they require two creatures to operate, they can be moved without hindrance by two creatures, and they must be loaded with some form of fuel and ammunition on a regular basis to be fired.

### Two-Creature Weapon Rules
Two-creature weapons require at least two creatures to operate them, and they come with the following additional rules considerations:


#### The Weapons Team
The two creatures operating a two-creature weapon are known as the weapons team. The weapons team consists of a leader and a follower. Only one creature can be assigned to each role, and they cannot switch roles once assigned, even if one of the roles becomes vacant, unless they leave the weapons team and rejoin.

##### Joining a Weapons Team

Joining a two-creature weapons team costs a creature's action and half of its movement as it equips its part of the weapon. If one creature is already part of the weapons team, it may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature joining the team. Leaving a weapon team requires no action as the creature drops its part of the weapon.

A creature must have both hands available to be on a weapons team and can't pick anything else up without dropping its part of the weapon.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The creatures within a weapons team must stay within 5 feet of each other and the weapon at all times. If one of them is ever more than 5 feet away from the weapon or the other team member, it is no longer part of the team. 

##### Moving Two-Creature Weapons
The follower can no longer move on its turn except to leave the weapons team. The leader's speed becomes equal to the lowest speed among the creatures on the weapons team. Whenever the leader moves, it can choose to move the follower along with it if the follower is willing, even when the leader is moved against its will. 

##### Stealth
While part of a weapons team, a creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, activating a two-creature weapon reveals the weapons team's location if they are hidden.



#### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Two-Creature <br> Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

#### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged.

#### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

#### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning two-creature weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

#### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

#### Functions
By default, weapons can have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by creatures on their weapons teams. The Load and Crank functions <br> can be activated by the follower, and the Fire <br> function can be activated by the leader. Each <br> function can only be activated once per round. 

##### Load
This function is used by the follower to reload <br> the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. <br> It requires the follower to have immediate <br> access to the weapon's ammunition, and <br> creatures can use their reaction to make <br> opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits <br> the follower this way, it drops the ammo and <br> wastes its action.

##### Crank
Not all weapons have this function. If a weapon <br> does, it must be activated by the follower before <br> each use of the Fire function to move the ammo <br> or fuel through the weapon.

##### Fire
The function is activated by the leader to fire the <br> weapon. When this function is activated, but before <br> its effect occurs, roll to see if a Mishap occurs.

\columnbreak



 If a Mishap occurs, its effects happen before the effects of the Fire. This function can't be used if the weapon is out of ammo or if the weapon has a Crank function that hasn't been used since the weapon was last loaded or fired.

#### Mishaps
Mishaps represent the weapon experiencing a significant malfunction. There is always a risk of this when firing the weapon, and some weapons have other circumstances that risk a mishap. Whenever this risk occurs, roll a d6. On a result of 1, a Mishap occurs, and the creature who triggered it must roll on the weapon's Mishap Table to determine the nature of this malfunction (see the Mishap Table section).

If the weapon has less than half its hit points, roll 2d6 and take the lowest result when checking for a mishap. 

Unless stated otherwise, you must always check for a mishap when activating the Fire function.

#### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

#### Mishaps table
Most weapons have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways their functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishap Table.

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Iron Orcs

Iron orcs are an elite subrace of orcs <br> shrouded in mystery, their origins <br> unknown. Some legends whisper that <br> they were created by a malign empire <br> to serve as slave soldiers, bred for war <br> and obedience. This dark history, <br> whether true or not, has imbued the <br> iron orcs with a unique sense of <br> purpose and a grim determination that <br> sets them apart from their more chaotic <br> kin. 

Unlike their rowdy and wild kin, iron <br> orcs are characterized by their dour and <br> serious demeanor. They approach battle <br> with a level of discipline and focus that <br> is rare among orcs. This seriousness is <br> reflected in their daily lives as well, <br> where frivolity and infighting are kept to <br> a minimum. Iron orcs see themselves as <br> the pinnacle of orcish strength and <br> discipline, and they hold themselves to a <br> higher standard, both on and off the <br> battlefield. This disciplined lifestyle <br> fosters a sense of fierce camaraderie and <br> mutual respect that is uncommon in <br> other orc clans.

They equip themselves with the finest weapons and armor they can find, and they take great pride in maintaining their gear. Regular training sessions are a cornerstone of iron orc society, where warriors hone their skills and ensure their equipment is in top condition.

### The Immortals
The Immortals are a legendary group of iron orcs, comprised of the most powerful warriors to ever walk the world. Each member of this elite regiment is a battle-scarred veteran, having survived countless conflicts and emerged stronger with each battle. Their ferocity and resilience on the battlefield have earned them a reputation as a nearly unkillable force, feared by enemies and revered by their own kind. The Immortals are known not only for their formidable combat skills but also for their unyielding spirit, making them a symbol of iron orc endurance and might.

The Immortals are adept at quickly replenishing any losses to their ranks. The regiment selects its members from the most elite iron orcs, ensuring that only the best of the best join their ranks. This continuous infusion of top-tier warriors maintains their status as an unbreakable force, seemingly immune to the attrition that affects other military units. Their ranks never diminish for long, and their presence on the battlefield is a testament to the iron orcs' unrelenting pursuit of strength and dominance.

### Iron Orc Tactics

&emsp;**Armed To The Teeth.** Iron orcs choose their weapons based on the composition and characteristics of their enemies:



\columnbreak

* **Pike Chopper:** Selected when facing multiple highly mobile fighters, such as monks or rogues, to counteract their agility.

* **Greataxe Chopper:** Preferred against classes that rely on a few powerful attacks, such as paladins, barbarians, and rogues, to maximize damage during encounters.

* **Mace Chopper:** Effective against spellcasters, especially those concentrating on high-level spells, to disrupt their casting and focus.

**Fighting In Larger Forces.** The role of an iron orc is to disrupt foes to allow other orcs to deal more damage. If there are multiple iron orcs, each one can pick a different weapon mastery and focus on disrupting specific players, generally prioritizing the players with the most health. (Note: Why the ones with the most heat?)


**Crimson Spiller Tactics.** These orcs will prefer whichever weapon can hit two or more targets simultaneously, leveraging area-of-effect attacks for greater efficiency compared to multiple single-target attacks.

**Immortal Tactics.** The Immortals are known for their adaptability. When ***Da New Plan*** is triggered, it is used as an opportunity to change up their strategy and adapt to how the fight's going.

## Orc Bosses
Orc bosses are the most powerful orcs in their society, having clobbered their way to the top of the brutal hierarchy that governs orcish tribes. Through sheer strength and ruthless cunning, they command mobs of lesser orcs, enforcing their will with an iron fist. Their rise to power is a testament to their ability to dominate, and only the toughest, most ferocious orcs can earn the title of boss. These leaders are constantly on the lookout for the next battle, driving their tribes into a frenzy as they seek out new foes to conquer and lands to ravage.

Orcs who manage to command entire tribes are known as big bosses, while the mightiest of these leaders, who control vast tribes or even collections of tribes, earn the fearsome title of war bosses.  These warlords are the pinnacle of orcish power, capable of uniting large numbers of orcs under their banner and leading them into massive, devastating conflicts. A war boss's presence on the battlefield can inspire great surges of violence among their warriors, turning even the most disorganized mobs into a terrifying force of destruction.

&emsp; However, the orc hierarchy is rarely stable, and only the most brutal and cunning bosses can maintain their position for long. The moment a boss shows any sign of weakness or fails to lead their tribe to another victory, their reign is in jeopardy. Orcs respect power above all else, and a boss who cannot deliver victory is seen as unfit to lead. This leads to a constant threat of challengers rising up to dethrone them or the tribe descending into chaos as infighting breaks out. For an orc boss, maintaining control is a relentless struggle, where survival depends on their ability to continuously prove their strength and keep their tribe focused on the next great battle.


***Iron Orc Bosses.*** Iron orc bosses are the ultimate embodiment of discipline and strength within orcish society. Unlike their more chaotic kin, these leaders rise to power through a combination of brutal force and calculated strategy, commanding the respect and fear of their followers. Iron orc bosses are known for their unwavering focus and their ability to maintain order among even the most unruly orc mobs. They are meticulous in their preparations for battle, ensuring that their warriors are well-equipped and trained to perfection. These bosses are not only powerful combatants but also shrewd tacticians, capable of leading their iron orc tribes to victory through both brute strength and disciplined coordination. Their leadership is often more stable than that of other orc bosses, as they inspire loyalty through their unmatched prowess and the respect they command from their equally disciplined kin.

>
> ***Greataxe Chopper.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 17 (2d12 + 4) slashing damage. If this is the first attack the orc makes on its turn, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage on hit. If the orc has mastered this weapon, the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll before the start of the orc’s next turn.
>
> ***Mace Chopper.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If this is the first attack the orc makes on its turn, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage on hit. If the orc has mastered this weapon, a creature forced to make a concentration check due to this damage does so with disadvantage.
>
> ***Pike Chopper.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If this is the first attack the orc makes on its turn, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage on hit. If the orc has mastered this weapon, the target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the orc’s next turn.
>
> ***Brutal Encouragement.*** The orc pummels or berates any number of allies within 5 feet, dealing 5 (2d4) bludgeoning damage to each. Each ally so affected can immediately attempt a saving throw to end one or more conditions they’re currently suffering that allow a save to end. On a failed save, they can still attempt the save again at the end of their next turn.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Aggressive.*** The orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature it can see.
>
> ***Change Da Plan.*** The orc shouts new orders. The orc and up to two other creatures within 60 feet of it that can hear it and have the Da Plan trait can each switch which weapon they have mastered.

***Iron Orc Mega Warbosses.*** The iron orc mega warboss is the most brutal master of hand-to-hand combat among orc kind, capable of sizing up their foes and cutting them down with a single, devastating swing of their massive weapon. With a war cry that echoes for miles, the warboss summons iron orcs from across the land, forming a massive army ready to sweep away any settlement or opposing force foolish enough to stand in their path. 

Campaigns led by these mega warbosses become the stuff of legends, their conquests etched into the annals of history as tales of unmatched savagery and power.

### Orc Boss and Orc Warboss Tactics
* Battle Cry and War Surge should be used as soon as possible.
* Recharging the Battle Cry using greataxe attacks is a priority. If the orc boss cannot recharge its Battle Cry on its turn, its minions will try to knock a target prone or use the Help action to give it advantage on its next turn.

\columnbreak

### Iron Orc Boss Tactics
* Follow the same tactics as a regular iron orc.
* Use Brutal Encouragement whenever a creature is suffering from an effect that prevents it from attacking.
* Use Change Da Plan whenever the opponent adapts to the orc's tactics.

## Savage Orc Bosses
*Primitive Warlords of Primal Fervor*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Hills, Mountains, Underdark; **Treasure:** Armaments, Individual

Among savage orcs, only the fiercest and most devoted warriors ascend to leadership, assuming the mantle of Big Boss. These hulking zealots lead through sheer brutality and unshakable faith, charging headlong into combat without elaborate strategy. Amid roars of crude commands and savage war cries, they carve a bloody path through enemy lines. Their overwhelming might and primal conviction embolden their followers, reducing what would be bone-shattering blows to little more than a passing sting.

Savage orc bosses guide their tribes on massive hunts and merciless raids. So long as they satisfy their warriors’ need for slaughter and retain the blessing of shamans or prophets, they remain unchallenged. Their rule is held in brutal reverence, reinforced by vivid tales of triumphant battles. Should they ever lose favor or fail to spill enough blood, would-be rivals swiftly emerge, eager to seize power for themselves.


### Savage Orc War Bosses
Those bosses who unite multiple tribes under their banner earn the fearsome title of War Boss. Their sheer ferocity pushes their hordes into a destructive frenzy, and only through iron might and a boundless thirst for conflict can they command such sprawling forces.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.


Their influence is so overwhelming that even more disciplined orcs are drawn into the wave of brutality these warlords generate, forsaking caution in favor of unchecked aggression. In the wake of such a primeval paragon, the civilized world burns.

### Savage Orc Boss Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs.
* War Surge should be used as soon as possible.
* Triggering Savage Resilience using greataxe attacks is a priority. If the orc boss cannot use its Savage Resilience on its turn, its minions will try to knock a target prone or use the Help action to give it advantage on its next turn.

## Savage Idols
*Rampaging Constructs Animated By Orcish Faith*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Hills, Mountains, Underdark; **Treasure:** Relics

Orcs are typically warmongers, ever eager to leap from one blood-soaked conflict to the next while shirking anything that resembles sustained labor. Consequently, they rarely construct lasting structures or leave anything permanent behind, even in the places where they pause briefly.
Yet, on rare occasions following a particularly momentous victory, an orc shaman may experience a divine revelation. Seized by this vision, the shaman compels their reluctant comrades to gather stones, broken metal scraps, and shattered wood from the wreckage of their conquests. These materials are heaped into a rough effigy of an Orcish deity, daubed with primitive markings that imbue it with sacred power. If the tribe’s fervor is strong enough, that combined surge of aggression can rouse the statue to life, making it a living embodiment of Orcish wrath.

Such monstrosities are known as savage idols, and they rank among the most devastating creations of orcish magic. No two idols look exactly alike, but they commonly rise to around sixteen feet in height, fashioned primarily from stone with scattered bits of metal or wood interwoven throughout. Threads of green magic pulse through their frames, binding them together as they lumber forth in an unrelenting quest to devastate anything in their path.

For any foe unfortunate enough to attract its gaze, a savage idol is akin to a natural calamity. Its massive limbs can smash fully armored warriors into pulp, while its rocky hide shrugs off most counterattacks. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Even more terrifying is the morale boost it offers to nearby orcs, who channel the idol’s sheer ferocity into a frenzy of violence. Facing even a single orc inspired by such a hulking symbol of might is a challenge few warriors survive.

Despite its awe-inspiring power, a savage idol suffers from crucial flaws. Its drive to destroy is absolute, leaving no room for strategy or self-preservation. Worse yet, its impatience for battle knows no bounds; if enemies do not appear swiftly enough, the idol may turn on its own warband in frustration. Moreover, its continued existence hinges on a constant wellspring of orcish fury. Without that energy, it gradually grows dormant, reverting to an inert heap of stone and scrap. However, the enchantments within it never fully fade. Years—or even decades—can pass before a fresh wave of orcish magic or a new horde of marauding greenskins stirs the slumbering idol to rampage once again.

In rare cases, savage idols have fallen under the sway of forces other than orcs. Particularly cunning or powerful spellcasters might revive an ancient idol’s remains or even wrest limited control of a newly awakened one from an orcish warband. But no matter how strong the magic, they can only guide—not command—this living engine of ruin, which ultimately remains loyal to the roar of war above all else.

### Savage Idol Tactics
Idols employ simple tactics, aiming to hit as many enemies as possible with melee attacks. If they are unable to do so, they resort to a rock attack.

### The Big 'Un
The Big’n stands as a legend among all Orcish kind—an idol of such colossal size and power that no other effigy has ever equaled its holy ferocity. Many orcs believe it to be the embodiment of their god walking the earth. Over the centuries, mighty war tribes have added their own sacred touches to its form, layering on enchanted totems, rune stones, and even the remnants of other savage idols. With each added artifact, the Big 'Un has expanded to awe-inspiring proportions.

On the rare occasions when the Big 'Un awakens, entire landscapes are reshaped, and settlements vanish beneath its unstoppable fury. Massive hordes of zealous orcs follow close behind, chanting praises to what they view as the living embodiment of their divine patron. Its might is so overwhelming that if any portion of the idol is torn free—whether by a lucky blow or immensely powerful attack—it comes alive on its own and continues fighting. However, these rampages are short-lived: the unrelenting violence required to keep the Big 'Un on its feet is too great to sustain for long.

In the centuries since its first recorded appearance, countless conflicts have ignited over the remains of the Big 'Un. Knightly orders and other warriors of the civilized world seek to secure its fragments, preventing them from falling back into orcish hands. 

\columnbreak

<br>

Unable to destroy the idol’s sacred pieces, they instead scatter and hide them across distant lands. Undeterred, orcish warbands embark on sacred quests to reclaim and reassemble these shards. Many tribes prophesize that one day, a warlord with a horde vast enough will rise, awakening the Big 'Un for good—never allowing it to fall silent again.

#### Destroying the Big 'Un and Its Shards

If you wish to incorporate the Big’n into your campaign, here are several ways it might be destroyed:

**Rivalry Among Orcs.** If two orc war bosses battle over a fragment of the Big 'Un, their struggle may shatter it.

**Peaceborne Annihilation.** If a peace treaty between two warring nations is signed upon the remains of the Big 'Un, the idol's power could be nullified.

**The Cry of Fear.** If a shaman or warlord standing near the remains of the Big 'Un lets out a scream of pure terror, its essence may dissipate.

**Sacred Ruination.** To ensure the Big 'Un’s final destruction, each of its four remaining shards must be inscribed with a master rune, each carved by a different rune-smith. Once completed, the shards must then be placed atop separate mountain peaks, where they will be destroyed.

> Whenever the Big 'Un loses a layer of runes, each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. 
>
> The Big 'Un then creates a **Rogue Shard** in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it. That Rogue Shard acts on its own turn, immediately after the Big 'Un’s turn.  
>  
> The Big 'Un and each friendly creature within 60 feet of it gain a +1 bonus to AC, saving throws, and attack rolls for each layer of runes it has.
>
> ***Crushing Projectile.*** The Big 'Un has advantage instead of disadvantage on ranged weapon attacks against prone targets.
>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The Big 'Un is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The Big 'Un either makes a slam attack against each target in a 20-foot cube originating from itself, or it makes a rock attack against each target within 10 feet of a point it can see within 220 feet. After making ranged attacks with this feature, the Big 'Un takes 33 (6d10) force damage.
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage, plus 22 (4d10) additional bludgeoning damage per rune layer remaining on the Big 'Un.
>
> ***Rock.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, range 120/240 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 33 (6d10) bludgeoning damage. A creature hit by this attack must succeed on a DC 23 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If it fails by 5 or more, it can’t stand up until the end of the Big 'Un’s next turn unless it uses all its movement to attempt a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, standing on a success.

## Killgrim Ironfist
Killgrim Ironfist is a legendary iron orc boss whose origins are as mysterious as they are brutal. A grizzled veteran, Killgrim wandered the wastes with a band of fiercely loyal iron orc warriors, cutting down all who dared to stand in his path. His journey through desolate lands became the stuff of legend as he bested one orc tribe after another, each victory adding to his fearsome reputation. As word of his prowess spread, a following of orcs, monsters, and other creatures began to amass around him, drawn by the promise of battle and the glory of victory under his unstoppable leadership.

Despite the growing horde that followed him, Killgrim Ironfist preferred the company of other iron orcs, whose discipline and strength matched his own. He tolerated the presence of lesser orcs and other creatures only as long as they proved useful in his relentless pursuit of war. A brutal and masterful warrior, Killgrim is scarred from countless battles, with a missing eye that only adds to his terrifying visage. His weapons, said to be magically enhanced by the power of his supernatural rage, allow him to wield his axe with blinding speed, sending hewn limbs flying in every direction as he fights. Killgrim is driven by an insatiable need for combat, never allowing more than a few days to pass without seeking out a new foe to unleash his fury upon. This constant hunger for battle makes him a force of destruction that few can withstand, and his legend continues to grow with each bloody victory.

### Epic Kilgrim Battle
If you wish to make Kilgrim Ironfist into a higher-level threat, increase the temporary hit points granted by his Da Stance feature to 100 and don't have him lose the benefits of a stance when he switches to a new one. These changes increase his Challenge Rating (CR) to 20.

### Killgrim Ironfist Tactics

#### Stances
Killgrim has three stances, each granting 50 temporary hit points when first entered. Kilgrim should not switch stances until these hit points are depleted. Once all stances have been used and no more temporary hit points can be gained, switch to the most effective stance against the current target.

**Basher Stance:** Effective against spellcasters.

**Debilitator Stance:** Great against nearly every martial class.

**Impeder Stance:** Useful against highly mobile fighters such as monks or rogues.


#### Reaction: Deafening Bellow 
Use this reaction against any full spellcaster whenever they are about to cast a spell and have not been hit by an attack from Grim Gore's Basher Stance.

#### Legendary Action: You're Next!
Target those most debilitated by Kilgrims's current stance. If no temporary hit points are left, switch to the most effective stance.

#### Legendary Action: Big Swing
 Use this action if Kilgrim can hit two or more targets. Use this rather than "You're Next!" if there is one target within range with a low Strength save.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Da Stance.*** When Kilgrim rolls initiative or uses a legendary action, he can choose one of the following stances until he uses this feature again or combat ends. The first time Kilgrim enters one of the stances during combat, he gains 50 temporary hit points that last until combat ends:
> - **Basher Stance.** When Kilgrim hits a creature with an attack, any concentration saves resulting from the damage have disadvantage, and the creature cannot cast spells other than cantrips until the end of its next turn.
> - **Debilitator Stance.** When Kilgrim hits a creature with an attack, the target has disadvantage on its next attack roll before the end of its next turn and cannot make more than one attack as part of its action or bonus action until the end of its next turn.
> - **Impeder Stance.** When Kilgrim hits a creature with an attack, the target's speed is reduced by 10 feet, and it cannot take bonus actions until the end of its next turn. 
>
> <br>***Gut Slasher.*** During the first round of combat, Kilgrim can take his turn at initiative count 22 (losing ties).  
>
> ***Weapons of Fury.*** Any weapon Kilgrim wields becomes magical, and he cannot be disarmed of these weapons.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** Kilgrim makes two attacks.  
>
> ***Gut Slasher.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 20 (2d12 + 7) slashing damage. If this is the first attack Kilgrim makes on his turn, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage.  
>
> ***Wing Puncturing Javelin.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is flying, Kilgrim has advantage on the attack, and on a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and dazed until the end of its next turn.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Truculent Dash.*** Kilgrim can move up to his speed toward a hostile creature that he can see without provoking opportunity attacks, ignoring difficult terrain.
>
> ### Reaction
> ***Deafening Bellow.*** When a creature within 120 feet that Kilgrim can see or hear attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or the spell fails. If the spell is cast using a spell slot, the slot isn't expended. The action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast the spell is still lost.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> Kilgrim can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Kilgrim regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
>
> **Check.** Kilgrim makes a skill check that would normally require an action.  
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If Kilgrim is suffering from an effect that allows him to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of his turn, he may immediately make that saving throw with advantage. He can use this legendary action even while incapacitated.  
>
> **You're Next!** Kilgrim moves up to his speed toward a hostile creature without provoking opportunity attacks, ignoring difficult terrain, and then makes a Gut Slasher attack against it. He cannot target the same creature again with this ability until the end of his next turn.  
>
> **Big Swing (Costs 2 Actions).** Kilgrim makes a melee attack against each creature within 5 feet of him, rolling separately for each target. If he makes only one attack in this way, the attack has advantage, and on a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or Kilgrim automatically hits the target with another Gut Slasher attack. If the target fails by 10 or more, the second attack is a critical hit.

## Warzog
*Da Best Prophet*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Hills, <br> Mountains, Underdark; <br> **Treasure:** Individual, Relics <br>

Through the annals of history, countless <br> prophets, seers, and divine heralds have stomped <br> across the mortal world, dutifully relaying whatever cosmic memo their patron deity was dictating to them. Some were revered. Some were martyred. Some were so nonsensical that even their own followers couldn’t remember why they were following them to begin with. But among these celestial mouthpieces, none have ever matched the sheer, unparalleled greatness of the aptly named Warzog, Da Best Prophet.

Or so claim the orcs. Every single one of them. Enthusiastically. Loudly. And, most often, violently. Other races, for reasons entirely unfathomable to orcish sensibilities, tend to vehemently disagree with this assertion, dismissing it as "absurd," "nonsensical," and in one particularly strong-worded case, "a total load of hogwash."

However, belief in Warzog’s indisputable, irrefutable, utterly unquestionable status as the greatest prophet stems from his discovery of The Three Categorical Truths of Everythin’:

**1.** Orcs are da best.

**2.** The more Orcish you and your mates are, the more scraps you win.

**3.** If you ever meet a git more Orcish than yourself, just be even more Orcish.

These fundamental truths have never been disputed by an orc. Even the thickest-headed git understands these principles when they are laid bare. The only problems in an orc’s life arise when they forget these truths. And truly, this is the only problem an orc can ever have—usually due to some other group of un-Orcish fellows attempting to prove their own way of being "the best" in a manner that does not involve being an orc. Which, of course, is utter nonsense.

But this is precisely where Warzog shines. For no one is better at reminding them.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Wherever he goes, Warzog seeks out forgotten tribes who are no longer being their best Orcish selves. With great care and even more noise, he riles up the tribe, ensuring they remember that they are the best before leading them in a spectacularly violent corrective campaign against anyone foolish enough to have tricked them into thinking otherwise. Following a thorough and enthusiastic reaffirmation of Orcish Dominance, Warzog then sets off to do it all over again somewhere else. But before he leaves, he makes sure to use the generous amount of rubble provided by the now-departed not-orc population to build massive monuments to the Orcish god—just to make sure that no one ever forgets what it means to be an orc. 

**Why Warzog is Clearly Da Best.**
Warzog’s far-reaching success comes from his knack for making a point without resorting to words. Orcs, after all, don’t care much for talking. Instead, Warzog demonstrates his fundamental truths through action.

His unshakable self-assured superiority warps reality to his eccentric will—a sight that would unsettle anyone who isn’t an orc. Heads burst at his presence, and both armor and flesh crumble under the weight of his unwavering stare. Even the mightiest champions, should they dare question orcish supremacy, are instantly transformed into small, squirming pests before being teleported into Warzog’s iron grip. After all, nothing's more un-orcish than finding yourself turned into a shrieking, helpless nuisance  in the hands of a true orc.

Such is the legend of Warzog, Da Best. Should you, by some astounding chance, meet an orc who claims otherwise, rest assured—they won’t hold that opinion for long.

> ### Traits
> ***Primal Surge.*** Warzog is quickened** during the first round of combat.
>
> ***Squiggly Curse (1/Day).*** On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Warzog chooses up to six creatures within 90 feet of him that he is aware of. Each must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw. Warzog then chooses one creature that fails this saving throw, which is afflicted by the curse and immediately transformed into a **Squiggly Beast**, teleporting into Warzog’s free hand where he immediately grapples it (escape DC 19). The transformed creature uses the Squiggly Beast’s statistics, except it retains its original hit points, Hit Dice, and Constitution score, as well as its alignment and personality. This transformation ends if the target dies, Warzog dies, or another creature is afflicted by this feature.  
> The target’s gear melds into its new form; it can’t activate, use, or otherwise benefit from that equipment, nor can it interact with any dropped gear. It also can’t speak, cast spells, or perform actions requiring hands or speech. Only a spell of 6th level or higher can remove this effect.
>
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** Warzog makes two melee attacks.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** Warzog is a spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +12 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:
> - **At will:** *guidance, mage hand, thaumaturgy, brain burster** (3rd level), *brutal glare**, *psychic headbutt**, *savage fists**  
> - **3/day each:** *arcane hand, here we go!**  
> - **1/day each:** *foot of the gods** 
>
> <Br>***Quarterstaff Chopper.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) if wielded with two hands. If this is the first attack Warzog makes on his turn, it deals an extra 5 (2d4) damage.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Aggressive.*** Warzog can move up to his speed toward a hostile creature he can see.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> Warzog can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn. He regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
>
> **Check.** Warzog makes a skill check that would normally require an action.  
>
> **Jumbo Prod.** Warzog channels psychic force to shove a creature within 100 feet of him that just took its turn. That creature must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet in a direction of Warzog’s choice. If Warzog is grappling a Squiggly Beast, the DC increases to 22 and the target also takes 13 (3d8) force damage on a failed save.
>
> **Noggin Shaker.** Warzog rattles the mind of a creature within 100 feet of him that just took its turn. That creature must succeed on a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become dazed** until the end of its next turn. If Warzog is grappling a Squiggly Beast, the DC increases to 22 and the target also takes 13 (3d8) psychic damage on a failed save.
>
> **Snatch Up.** Warzog moves up to 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, then attempts to grapple a Squiggly Beast within 5 feet of him that has just taken its turn.  
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If Warzog is suffering from an effect that requires him to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of his next turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success. Warzog can use this legendary action even if he is incapacitated.

When Warzog is reduced to 256 hit points or fewer, he may immediately end any spells affecting him and recharge his Squiggly Curse ability.

Additionally, while a **Squiggly Beast** is within 120 feet of him, he gains a protective ward for the next hour, granting him resistance to all damage unless the damage is caused by a creature that is grappling a Squiggly Beast.

Warzog does not benefit from the ward while he is affected by Squiggly Bane.



### Ashragoth's Lair (NOTE: Need Lair Write Up)
Ashragoth makes his lair in an obsidian tower located within a volcanic wasteland. Within the ziggurat, countless forges and altars are dedicated to the dark gods. The petrified bodies of former pupils and rivals of Ashragoth are embedded within the ramparts of the structure, At the heart of the temple lies Ashragoth’s personal laboratory, where he conducts his own dark experiments.

#### Lair Actions

When Warzog rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or Warzog dies, the lair has an Intelligence 6 and can act of its own accord but always acts in Warzog's best interest. While active this way, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

While in his lair, Warzog's challenge rating increases by 1.

**Ju-Ju Hex.** The lair chooses a Squiggly Beast within it, cursing the creature with a Ju-Ju Hex for 1 minute, until Warzog dies, or until the creature receives the Squiggly Boon. While cursed, the creature takes 13 (3d8) force damage at the end of each of its turns.

**Ju-Ju Surge.** Warzog gains a surge of ju-ju energy. This effect lasts until he leaves the lair, dies, use this action again, or is affected by Squiggly Bane. While benefiting from the surge, Warzog regains 13 (3d8) hit points at the end of each of his turns.

**Mumbo-Jumbo Burst.** The lair chooses a Squiggly Beast within it and releases a surge of energy in a 20-foot radius around it. Each creature other than a Squiggly Beast in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

> ### Traits
> ***Ju-ju Conduit.*** Any creature grappling the squiggly beast can use it as a spellcasting focus while it is being grappled.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The squiggly beast has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, plus 7 (2d6) poison damage.
>
> ***Squiggly Boon.*** The squiggly beast rolls a d6 and chooses one creature within 5 feet of it. That creature adds the result of the roll to its AC and any saving throws it makes until the end of the squiggly beast’s next turn.
>
> ***Squiggly Bane.*** The squiggly beast rolls a d6 and chooses one creature within 5 feet of it that is not grappling it. That creature subtracts the result of the roll from its AC and any saving throws it makes until the end of the squiggly beast’s next turn.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Nimble Escape.*** The squiggly beast takes the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action.
>
> ### Reaction
> ***Absorb Spell.*** If the squiggly beast is subjected to a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage on a successful save, and half damage on a failed one. Also, if it succeeds, it can choose itself or another creature within 5 feet of it. The first time the chosen creature hits with an attack on its next turn, the target of that attack takes an additional 10 (3d6) force damage.

### Warzog's Tactics
Warzog's primary goal during battle is to keep hold of the Ju-Ju Squiggly Beast, if there is one. His priority target is any creature currently holding the Squiggly Beast.

#### Default Spell Usage
**Stomping Foot.** A great opening move to force grouped enemies into unfavorable positions. Focus on prone creatures to gain bonus damage. <br>

<br>**Arcane Hand.** Use if *foot of the gods* is not available. 
* Primarily used to grab backline opponents and drag them into melee combat.
* Can also be used to grab and restrain the Squiggly Beast.

<br>**Headbutt.** Used to break the concentration of enemy spellcasters.
* Priority over all other spells if an enemy spellcaster is concentrating on a higher-level spell than Warzog can cast.

<br>**Brain Burster.** Use frequently to disrupt enemy spellcasters.

<Br>**Brutal Glare.** Use when:
* Two or more targets with low Dexterity are in range.
* A 5th or higher-level spell is not available.

##### Legendary Actions
* **Snatch Up.** Used to retrieve a Squiggly Beast that has escaped, if it is within 20 feet.

    * The creature holding the Squiggly Beast is more than 20 feet away from Warzog.
