# Tundra Compendium

Tundras are vast, cold, and often desolate landscapes that present unique challenges and opportunities for adventurers. These harsh environments serve as significant barriers to travel, testing the endurance and resilience of those who dare to cross them. Tundras can be the setting for dour quests, where survival against the elements is as much a part of the adventure as any enemy or dungeon. These bleak and unforgiving landscapes provide a grim and foreboding backdrop for any adventure.

This document provides content to help you run games that feature tundras of various types, from the icy plains of the far north to temperate regions plunged into harsh winters. This content ranges from character options for players who want their characters to be associated with winter or tundra regions, to mechanics for running sessions with travel through tundras to a bestiary of tundra creatures to populate the icy regions of your games. Whether the players are only spending a day traveling through the cold or your entire campaign takes place in the arctic, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

## Tundra Adventure Ideas

Tundra and winter environments make for natural adventure locales. The following adventure hooks can be used as inspiration for creating your own icy adventures. They could either be minor side quests or part of much larger campaign-spanning adventures.

##### Tundra Adventure Hooks

| d8  | Setup |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Tundra Beast:** Rumors of a gigantic beast terrorizing isolated villages on the tundra reach the adventurers. Tasked with stopping the creature, they discover it is actually a cursed druid. |
|  2  | 	T**he Frozen Heart:** A powerful artifact known as the Frozen Heart has been stolen, plunging the region into an eternal winter. The adventurers are hired to retrieve the artifact and restore balance to the climate. |
|  3  | **Icebound Expedition:** An expedition team searching for a lost city of ice has gone missing. The adventurers are hired to find the team and explore the secrets of the lost city. |

|   |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  4  | **Frozen Shipwreck:** An ancient ship has been found frozen in the ice, its crew preserved in time. The adventurers must investigate the ship, uncover its history, and deal with any dangers that still linger. The ship holds valuable cargo and secrets of a lost civilization, but its former crew may not be as dead as they appear. |
|  5  | **Winter's Wrath:** A powerful winter spirit has cursed a region with unending blizzards. The adventurers must appease the spirit or break its curse to bring back the warmth of spring. |
|  6  | **Frozen Refuge:** Refugees from a neighboring kingdom seek shelter in the tundra after their homeland is invaded. The adventurers must escort them to safety, navigating the harsh terrain and avoiding pursuers.  |
|  7  | **The Glacial Crypt:** A glacier has receded to reveal the entrance to an ancient crypt. The adventurers are hired to explore the crypt and retrieve any magical artifacts within, facing undead guardians and treacherous traps. |
|  8  | 	**Winter Wolf Raiders:** A group of marauding winter wolves has been raiding supply caravans, leaving the survivors to face the harsh elements without resources. The adventurers are tasked with protecting the next caravan and tracking the wolves to their lair, where they must face the pack in a brutal showdown. |

# Player <br> Options

## Druid Circle

### Circle of The Tundra
Most druids of this circle make their homes in the coldest environments their world has to offer, and they have adapted all aspects of their druidic abilities to reflect this harsh environment.  They practice shapeshifting into arctic creatures while channeling the brutal nature of their boreal homes to unleash icy magics upon their enemies and can even summon and control enchanted glaciers with which to smite their foes.

#### Tundra Spells
*2nd Level Circle of the Tundra Feature*<br>
Your mystical connection to the arctic infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells.  Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.  If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.  

##### Circle of The Tundra Spells

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *armor of agathys*, *ice knife* |
|  3rd          | *ice sheet**, *frost nova** |
|  5th          | *sleet storm*, *winter's kiss**   | 
|  7th          | *fire shield*(cold shield only), *ice storm** |
|  9th          | *cone of cold*, *icy tomb** |

**New spell found in New Spells section*

#### Tundra Forms
*2nd Level Circle of The Tundra Feature* <br>
You can now use your Wild Shape feature to transform into unique arctic animal forms granted by this subclass, and when using your Wild Shape this way, you may use it as a bonus action. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br>

Detailed descriptions of these forms can be found in the Tundra Wild Shapes section.

When shapeshifting into these forms, you can choose to either be Small or Medium. Starting at 10th level, you can also choose to be Large. 

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Tundra Spells list and ignore their material component requirements.

You start knowing three of these forms: Elk, Wolf, and Wolverine. Additional wild shape forms from this subclass become available at levels 4 and 8. (In the case of the Elephant and Rhino forms, you become wooly versions of these creatures.)

##### Tundra Wild Shape Options
| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Elk, Wolf, Wolverine |
|  4th          | Bear, Leopard Seal, Lynx | 
|  8th          | Elephant, Rhino|

#### Boreal Dweller
*2nd Level Circle of The Tundra Feature*<br>
You gain resistance to cold damage. If you already have resistance to cold damage from a racial feature, you instead gain advantage on Constitution saving throws against effects that would deal cold damage to you. Your movement is also unaffected by difficult terrain made of ice or snow, and such terrain can't cause you to fall prone.

Additionally, you gain an advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) checks relating to tundra environments and the life that inhabits them. You can also speak with animals who dwell in tundra environments as though under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made while interacting with them.

 <img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/cPPYV7h.png' 
  style='position:absolute;right:-140px;top:-42px;height:1400px;width:1416px;transform:rotate(194deg)' />






\pagebreakNum

#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of The Tundra feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Glacial Summoning
*6th Level Circle of The Tundra Feature*<br>
You've gained the ability to call forth icy manifestations of your boreal homelands.  You may use your action to summon a glacial mass of ice, causing it to burst from a location on the ground or on top of a liquid surface that you can see within 20 feet.  The ice can be up to 10 feet long on any side, and it must be summoned in an unoccupied space large enough to contain it.

The ice has an AC 14 and hit points equal to five times your druid level.  It is immune to poison, psychic, cold damage, and vulnerable to fire, thunder and bludgeoning damage.  If reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles to mist.

The ice emanates a 10-foot aura of cold, and creatures other than you treat the space in this aura as difficult terrain.

As a bonus action, you can move the ice up to 20 feet along any solid or liquid surface.  If you move the ice into a creature, that creature must make the Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.  The creature takes 3d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

Once you summon the glacial, you cannot summon one again until you complete a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher.



\columnbreak

#### Avatar of The Tundra
*10th Level Circle of Tundra feature* <br>
When you use your Wild Shape feature to transform into one of the forms granted by this subclass, you can choose one of the following enhancements while in that form:

* **Aurora Form.** Your form is infused with the shimmering lights of the polar night sky, causing you to glow with a dancing green radiance. You emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Additionally, you have a fly speed equal to your form's walking speed.

* **Primordial Form.** Your form grows to the immense size of ancient megafauna. Your size becomes Huge in your new form, and your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage. Additionally, you get a +2 bonus to Strength saving throws and the spell save DC for any abilities your wild shape has.

* **Wendigo Form.** Your form becomes emaciated and sinuous as you hunger for the warmth of life. When you hit a non-undead, non-construct creature with a melee attack granted by your wild shape, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of damage dealt.


#### Frozen Assault
*14th Level Circle of The Tundra Feature*<br>
You can now channel the remorseless fury of the north through your attacks. Whenever you would deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage with a melee weapon attack, you may change the damage type to cold.
 
Additionally, whenever you deal cold damage to a creature or a creature starts its turn in an area of difficult terrain composed of ice or snow created by one of your druid spells or features, you may reduce its speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn. This speed reduction can't stack multiple times on a single creature.

## New Spells: <bR> Lore of Ice
This brand of magic draws on the powers of the frigid <br> north and winter itself. Those who practice it often dwell <br> in tundra locals, but others may revere winter and its solstice. Still, others may simply be elemental enthusiasts looking to compliment their magical arsenal with some freezing spells. Most of these spells conjure icey phenomena or unleash blasts of freezing magic capable of encasing targets in ice. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Ice often wield.

#### Deathly Frost
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard.

You cause a creature to be gripped by freezing cold. Until the spell ends, at the end of each of your turns, if the target is within 90 feet of you, it must make Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way. Any levels of exhaustion caused by this spell go away after the spell ends.

**The Blade's Properties.** It counts as a magical, simple melee weapon with which you and any number of creatures of your choice upon casting the spell are proficient with. It deals 2d10 slashing damage on hit and has the finesse, versatile (2d12), and thrown (range 60/90) properties. 

**Throwing The Blade.** When a creature uses the sword to make a thrown attack, hit or miss, the weapon explodes, and the spell ends. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d6 cold damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you may create an additional sword for every two levels above 3rd level.

A wave of cold 30 feet long and 15 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. The ground in the area is covered with ice, turning it into difficult terrain for the duration.

Creatures may move across the frozen surfaces as if they are difficult terrain.

**Slipping On The Ice.** When the ice appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. 

**Being Caught In The Water.** If a creature is swimming in an area where ice appears, it must make a Strength saving throw instead or become restrained by ice for the duration. A creature restrained by the ice or another creature that can reach it can also use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed. The target is also freed if any ice where at its location is destroyed. On a successful save, the creature can move below or above the now frozen surface.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the length of the line increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

When the ice storm initially appears or if a creature is inside its area at the end of your next turn, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

Ice encases one willing Medium or smaller creature you can see within range.

The ice has an AC equal to your spell save; HP 50; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). A creature trapped inside the ice is blinded, restrained, incapacitated, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ice, and becomes stable if it is at 0 hit points.

**Casting It As An Action.** You can choose to cast this spell as an action on your turn, choosing any creature within range. If the creature is not willing, it may make a Strength saving throw; on success, the spell ends and has no effect on the creature.

**Damaging The Ice From Within.** A creature inside the ice can choose to deal bludgeoning damage to the ice equal to 1d6 + its Strength modifier at the end of each of its turns.

**Casting It On Yourself.** If you cast the spell on yourself, it does not require Concentration, and you can choose to end the spell at the start of your turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you may make one additional snowball attack per action for every two slot levels above 2nd.

#### Soul of Winter
*9th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (sapphire worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

A 30-foot-radius sphere of whirling sub-zero cold springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. 

**Creatures In the Sphere When It's First Cast.** Each creature in the sphere, when it first appears, must succeed on a Strength saving. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 cold damage and is restrained by ice for 1 minute. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

**Icy Surfaces.** The surfaces within the sphere are coated in ice, making any ground in the area difficult terrain for one minute. The first time each turn that a creature either moves into or out of any difficult terrain created by the spell, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. 

**Creatures Ending Their Turn In The Sphere.** Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way.

**The Spell's End.** When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the ice in the sphere shatters in an explosion. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes piercing damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on <br> a successful one. The spell's base damage is 2d8. <br> At the end of each of your subsequent turns after <br> the spell has been cast, if the sphere has not yet <br> exploded, the damage increases by 2d8.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 40-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. 

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, while restrained this way, the target takes 2d6 cold damage. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage and the damage at the end of the restrained target's turn are increased by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

# Tundra Travel
Tundras are among the most extreme and unforgiving environments for overland travel. They are usually sparsely inhabited, and what few paths they have are often subjected to deadly hazards. Their lack of resources and extreme cold force travelers to bring their own food and cold resistance shelters and clothing. Those who become lost in such environments are seldom heard from again, their resources quickly dwindling as they are left at the mercy of the murderous cold. 

Extreme winters can impose many of these same hazards in non-tundra environments. However, some hazards and peculiarities, such as glacial crevasses and round-the-clock nights, are only found in polar environments.

## Travel Activities
When the players travel long distances overland, tundra environments can be a significant challenge in their journey. You may modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players travel through such terrain.

### Travel Pace
If the players are traveling through deep snow or across icy terrain, it is considered rough terrain unless they have footwear that helps them cross such terrain (snow shoes, ice boots, skis, etc.) Most normal mounts and vehicles will also have trouble moving through snowy terrain, and the players may need to use vehicles such as dog sleds.

### Navigation
The difficulty in navigating tundra environments can vary greatly. The DMG suggests a navigation DC of around 10 for most arctic environments. However, expansive, featureless snowscapes would likely have a DC of 15. 

\columnbreak


<br><br><br><br><br>

If most of the environment's land features are defined by snow banks, high winds and precipitation can cause major shifts in the landscape, distorting any prior familiarity the players have with an area.

Even if the players are following a normally navigable path that would normally negate the need for navigation, snow drifts could make such paths impassible, forcing them to find alternative routes.

Depending on the cosmology and day/night mechanics of your setting, the players may also experience days or nights that are of extreme length depending on the time of year. Long or perpetual days could allow them to travel in bright light for longer, or the polar night could make navigation and spotting hazards more difficult. 



### Foraging
Tundra environments tend to have little to no natural resources. In areas too cold to support forests, the foraging DC should be 20 or higher. In forested areas, it may be 15.


### Taking Shelter
While any environment can pose challenges to travelers looking to make shelter for the night, tundras are particularly unforgiving to the unprepared. Normal tents and bedrolls may be insufficient to ward off the effects of extreme weather and cold, thus preventing them from gaining the benefits of a long rest. The players may need special cold-weather camping equipment if they can't find a natural shelter from the elements.

## Tundra Hazards
Tundras are among the most hazardous natural environments. Extreme cold, strong wind, heavy precipitation, frigid waters, thin ice, and slippery ice are all common tundra hazards described in the DMG (pg. 110). Other hazards include hidden crevasses and frigid winds.  

### Hidden Crevasses
Snowy environments can hide crevasses and sudden drops. This is especially common if the players are traveling across glacial expanses. Such drops are functionally similar to hidden pit traps. To randomly determine their depth, you can make them 1d12*20ft. deep for the typical crevasse.

#### Spotting Crevasses
Rather than using passive Perception to spot hidden crevasses, you may opt to use the passive Survival of any characters keeping a lookout. The DC to spot the fall can be anywhere from 10 (barely hidden crevasses) to 30 (supernaturally hidden crevasses). You can pick what's appropriate for your environment or roll to determine one randomly.

#### Falling Through
If a creature doesn't spot the crevasse and falls through, it can make a Dexterity save to try to catch a ledge and prevent the fall. The DC of this save depends on the nature of the fall. A relatively narrow crevasse may only have a DC 10. A large crevasse that's 10s of feed wide with supernaturally slick ice ledges may have a DC 30. This save DC can be independent of the DC to spot the fall, and you can pick one you feel is appropriate to the situation or roll to determine it randomly.

If a creature fails to grab a ledge, it falls the full length of the crevasse. 

### Winds
Rules for strong winds are described on page 110 of the DMG. If you wish to make your winds particularly hazardous, you can modify them in the following ways; the save DCs and severity of the effects these winds have are determined by the Wind Severity table.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

##### Extreme Cold
This wind carries a chill that cuts to the core. For every 1 minute a creature without cold resistance spends in the wind, it must make a Constitution save. On a failure, the creature takes an amount of cold damage dependent on the severity of the cold, and on a pass, it takes half as much damage. Creatures with insulating fur or clothing have advantage on this save.

##### Sudden Gusts
This wind will unexpectedly pick up gusts capable of bowling over creatures. At the start of every round of combat with this wind, roll 1d6. On a result of 5 or 6, all creatures not behind at least half cover are subjected to the effects of the *gust of wind* spell, except the distance they are moved on a failed save is dependent on the severity of the wind. 

If the players aren't in combat, this wind will greatly hamper travel for those not behind cover and make traveling near crevasses very dangerous. If players are traveling for an extended period of time through an open area subjected to sudden gusts, have each of them make a Strength save for each hour of travel. On a success, they are able to push through the winds, and on a failure, they treat the terrain areas as though it's rough terrain while they struggle to fight against the winds. If the terrain is already rough terrain, creatures can only move through it at 1/4th the speed. 

##### Wind Severity
|      Wind Severity      | Wind Save DC |  Cold Damage |  Gust Push Distance | 
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|

## Example Random Encounter Tables
The following are different tundra environments across varying levels of gameplay, complete with random encounter tables you can use when the players are traversing them.  You can plug these right into your games, modify them to better suit your campaign, or simply use them as inspiration for creating and running your own river encounters.

Each tundra has a DC determining its foraging difficulty and an activity level suggesting how often to roll for a random encounter. There is also some information on the types of weather events likely to happen in these environments and what their DC range should be.

Not every encounter is meant to be a fight the players should be forced into. If the players are on the lower end of the level range, some of the encounters might be overwhelming for them, and they should have the option to attempt to avoid combat through other interactions, hiding, or fleeing. You can avoid encounters that seem like they wouldn't fit the current situation or modify them as needed.

Creatures on the tables with a single asterisk by their name are new creatures that can be found later in the creatures section of this document. Creatures with two asterisks can be found as free content on our website (www.StarsailGames.com) or Patreon (www.patreon.com/starsailgames). Creatures with three asterisks can be found just after the table.

**Foraging DC:** 15 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 15 <br>
**Weather DC:**  Save DCs for weather events range from 10-15.


The Ice Pine Tundra is a boreal region characterized by vast pine forests punctuated by open snow-covered hills. Recently, it has become a focal point for mystic turmoil as three renegade crone apprentices fled their mentors to test their powers. Seeking to bind fey creatures to their will, they summoned kallikantzaroi from the fey wild. However, these creatures have proven uncontrollable, wreaking havoc across the tundra. Their unchecked rampage has led to widespread deforestation, disrupting the ecosystem and driving native wildlife to exhibit erratic behavior. The once serene landscape now bears the scars of magical folly, with chaos reigning in the wake of the renegades' failed experiment.

### The Winter Cursed Vale <Br>(Level 5-10)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 3 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 10 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 10 <br>
**Weather:** Save DCs for weather events range from 15-20.

The Winter Cursed Vale was once a flourishing valley, teeming with life and home to a vibrant fiefdom. However, it has now fallen victim to a relentless curse, shrouding it in perpetual winter. This curse has not only frozen the landscape but has also awakened the dead, turning the valley into a haunting ground for roaming undead. Traveling in and out of the valley has become perilous, with the living inhabitants locked in a constant struggle for survival against the undead threats.

Adding to the chaos are hill giants from the surrounding areas, exploiting the valley's vulnerability by leading bands of ogres to pillage its remaining resources. The true origins of the curse and any potential involvement of the ruling nobility remain shrouded in mystery, adding to the sense of despair and danger that pervades the Winter Cursed Vale.

### The Far Glaciers (Level 11-16)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 6 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 25 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 25 <br>
**Weather:** Save DCs for weather events range from 20-25.

The Far Glaciers form a remote and frigid sea, encompassing a distant archipelago devoid of settlements and rarely visited. Harsh conditions make life scarce even for animals, rendering these islands inhospitable. While thick ice blankets much of the archipelago, scholars speculate that these lands were once inhabited by an ancient civilization. Sparse artifacts hint at this, although few who venture there return to corroborate theories.

Exploring the glaciers is perilous; the bone-chilling cold and glacial dangers claim many lives. Survivors speak of forgotten horrors entombed within the ice and arcane constructs powered by unknown technologies. Such accounts are dismissed as the ramblings of madness, attributed to the extreme isolation and conditions faced in these icy depths.

The Demon Wastes, situated in the far north, teeters on the edge of a planar convergence with a demonic realm, imbuing the region with dark energies. This influence has twisted the landscape, turning it into a nightmarish wasteland. The area is plagued by frequent demonic incursions, with warmongering demons rampaging through, leaving destruction in their wake.

However, the land itself rebels against this desecration, unleashing aggressive elementals and supernatural wildlife to fiercely defend its sanctity. Anyone who dares intrude on these cursed lands risks facing not only the wrath of demons but also the vengeful fury of the land itself.

 Bears are a symbol of strength and resilience, <br> captivating the imagination of humanoids across many cultures with their formidable presence and diverse range <br> of habitats. Known for their significant physical power, bears can take down large prey and defend themselves against most threats. Their thick fur and robust frames make them durable and allow them to withstand harsh conditions and engage in long pursuits.

Despite their substantial size, bears possess an unexpected speed and navigational versatility, enabling them to traverse challenging terrains, climb, and swim with remarkable proficiency. This agility complements their physical might, making them adept at catching swift prey or evading dangers in their natural habitats. Moreover, bears are equipped with keen senses, particularly an exceptional sense of smell, which aids them in tracking down food, sensing danger, and navigating their environment with an acute awareness.

Bears also display notable intelligence and problem-solving skills, especially when foraging for food or navigating obstacles.

### Black Bears
Black bears, with their lustrous dark fur and imposing stature, wander the expansive wilds of their domain, a testament to their versatility and adaptability. These creatures are known to inhabit various enclaves of the wilderness, from deep, shadowed woods to the edges of vast and silent glades. While their fur is commonly as dark as night, some boast coats of cinnamon or even white, hinting at the rich diversity among their kind. This diversity is not merely cosmetic; it is a sign of a multitude of subspecies, each adapted to its unique corner of the natural world.

These bears are omnivorous, with a diet as varied as the lands they roam. They forage with an opportunistic zeal, partaking in nature's bounty from berry bush to honeycomb.

But, when the situation calls for it, they can hunt with a surprising combination of stealth and power.

Their keen intelligence and curiosity often lead them to explore and sometimes even manipulate their environments in search of sustenance or shelter.

In terms of demeanor, black bears are generally shy around other humanoids, often displaying a peaceful disposition. However, they possess a fierce protective instinct, especially when it comes to their offspring or when they are surprised and feel threatened, and in such cases, they can demonstrate the full force of their natural prowess. Their strength, coupled with sharp instincts, makes them respected by all who share their territory.

### Brown Bears
Brown bears are the stalwarts of the wilderness, with a range of fur colors that blend into the varied landscapes they inhabit. These large and powerful animals are found in numerous regions, each home to distinct subspecies with their own unique adaptations. Their diet is as broad as their habitat, consisting of fruits, nuts, fish, and small mammals, showcasing their omnivorous nature. 

While brown bears typically lead solitary lives, they may gather in numbers in areas of abundant food like a rich salmon run. They have a complex social structure that becomes apparent during these gatherings, where hierarchies are observed and occasionally contested. Despite their solitary nature, mothers are fiercely protective of their cubs, teaching them essential survival skills.

As winter approaches, brown bears enter a phase of intense eating known as hyperphagia to prepare for hibernation, significantly increasing their food intake to build fat reserves. This crucial period heightens their aggression as the drive to feed becomes paramount. Bears are more likely to encounter others during this time, defending their food sources fiercely. The necessity to fatten up can make them more dangerous, as they prioritize feeding over avoiding conflict, posing increased risks to themselves and others.

#### Grizzly Bears
The large and ferocious subspecies known as grizzly bears have captured the awe of those who share or venture into their territories. Their more aggressive nature is often a result of the fierce competition for resources and the need to defend their space. They are slightly larger than most other brown bears and have a distinct hump on their shoulders, a feature that highlights their powerful forelimbs and their ability to dig and forage. Grizzlies are particularly known for their impressive physical capabilities and can often be more aggressive and dangerous, especially when surprised or when they are with their cubs. Some grizzlies become brazen hunters, willing to attack humanoids without provocation. This has made them among the most feared animals by those traveling through remote wilds.

### Polar Bears

In the frigid expanses of the northern realms, the polar bear stands as a majestic and formidable hunter. These colossal beasts, robed in shimmering coats of snow-white fur, are the undisputed sovereigns of their icy domain. Adult males, towering and robust, can weigh as much as 700 kg, with females being notably smaller yet equally impressive.

Blessed with a thick layer of fat and a dense, water-repellent fur, these giants are insulated against the harshest of colds. Their bodies are so adept at retaining heat that the challenge often lies in staying cool rather than warm. With large, partially webbed front paws, Polar Bears are skilled swimmers, capable of traversing vast and treacherous waters. They are known to journey tirelessly across the seas, navigating the chilling waters with ease.

As apex predators, they primarily feast upon the seals that dwell in the same icy waters. They employ a cunning mix of patience and stealth, utilizing the sea ice as their hunting grounds to outwit their prey. Equipped with a remarkably acute sense of smell, polar bears can detect the faintest scent of a seal from a mile away, even under layers of snow and ice. Their vision and hearing, on par with humans, further enhance their hunting prowess. Should any humanoid adventurers venture into their icy domains, polar bears won't hesitate to employ the same hunting tactics against the unfortunate travelers.

#### Tyrant Polar Bears
These primeval bears are larger and more robust than their 'modern' descendants. Thought to be extinct by most, some of these lone monsters still roam remote arctic wastelands where they hunt other large megafauna, spilling blood across the ice as they assert their rulership over this brutal domain. Tundra-dwelling humanoids may venerate these creatures as servants of the gods, and spiritual

### Arctotheriums

Arctotherium, the ancient primeval bear known as the short-faced bear, stands as a towering figure in the annals of natural history. These bears are characterized by their expansive chests and shortened snouts, a distinct feature from which they derive their name. Despite their formidable size, they are agile, capable of covering ground swiftly, a trait that serves them well in their pursuit of prey and sustenance.

These primeval creatures are omnivorous, with a preference for large meals to support their massive builds. Their diets are adaptable, consisting of anything the land offers, from vegetation to larger game. Arctotherium's powerful forelimbs and strong jaws are their primary tools, enabling them to hunt effectively and scavenge from others when the opportunity arises.

Arctotherium are typically solitary, with each bear maintaining a large territory that overlaps with others only occasionally. These territories are the stages upon which they silently enact their daily rituals of foraging, hunting, and roaming. Interaction between these ancient bears is rare, limited to necessary engagements such as mating or competing for resources.

Though often spoken of as relics of a bygone era, arctotheriums are still rumored to roam the remote and wild recesses of the world. They may be found deep in primeval forests, guarding ancient shrines dedicated to ursine gods, or in the service of powerful druids. Adventurers who stumble upon such beasts do well not to anger them, for the arctotheriums's power and ferocity is far beyond that of any other bear they will have faced.

### Ice Bears
These colossal creatures, resembling ordinary polar bears, are endowed with a mystical frost that seems to weave into their very being. Their fur, shimmering with a pale blue hue, glistens like the heart of a glacier, while their eyes gleam with the cold light of the aurora.

The origin of these majestic beasts is shrouded in mystery. Some say they are the children of the winter gods, blessed or cursed with their icy might. Others believe they are polar bears transformed by a powerful sorcery, their forms infused with the essence of the eternal frost. Regardless of their origins, their supernatural nature is unmistakable. 

The ice bears possess a remarkable ability to radiate an aura of frost, a chilling presence that seeps into the bones of any creature daring enough to come close. This aura not only slows down their prey, making escape difficult, but also serves as a shield, warding off those who might challenge these titans.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

In the heat of battle or when hunting, they can unleash a formidable wave of cold, a blast of freezing energy that envelops their surroundings. This wave can root their prey in place, encased in a sheath of ice, helpless against the might of the Ice Bear.

While these bears are known to hunt the typical fauna of their frozen homes, they have also earned a fearsome reputation for preying on humanoid hunters and frontiersmen who venture too far into their domain. Their attacks are swift and devastating, leaving little more than ice-covered remnants in their wake.

Despite their ferocity and mystical nature, there are tales of these mighty beasts being captured and tamed. In the hands of a skilled beastmaster, an Ice Bear can become a formidable beast of war, its natural abilities harnessed for battle. The sight of an armored Ice Bear charging into the fray, its breath frosting the air, is enough to shake the resolve of even the bravest warriors.

On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t restrained.

### Elemental Bears
These gargantuan elementals, born from the very essence of the arctic lands, take on the formidable forms of massive polar bears, embodying the raw, unbridled spirit of their frigid homelands.

With bodies sculpted from ice and snow, these majestic beings are more than mere animals; they are the personification of the arctic wilderness. Their fur seems to be made of frost and icicles, shimmering with the pale light of the winter sun. Their eyes, deep and piercing, reflect the endless skies of their frozen realms. These Elemental Bears do not just inhabit the Arctic; they are the Arctic, its protectors and avatars.

Their primary purpose is deeply ingrained in their icy souls – to guard their homelands from any threat. These guardians are fiercely territorial, confronting any who dare to disrupt the delicate balance of their icy domains. 

They are not just animals; they are the embodiment of the Arctic's will, its defenders against the encroachment of outsiders and the despoiling of their pristine landscapes.

Surrounded by an eternal maelstrom of winter winds, Elemental Bears command the very essence of cold and ice. They can breathe cones of icy hail, turning foes into frozen statues. With a roar that echoes across the tundra, they can unleash waves of ice from their massive bodies, capable of freezing everything in their path, creating landscapes of glacial beauty and deadly stillness.

#### The Avatar of Winter

Among these elemental titans, there exists a being of extraordinary power, known in whispered tales as the Avatar of Winter. This elemental bear is revered as a demi-god, a manifestation of the winter season itself. Larger, more powerful, and more ancient than its kin, the Avatar of Winter is a force of nature personified, capable of summoning blizzards and shaping the very ice at will.

### Bear Tactics
Bears have very straightforward attack patterns that mostly involve charging straight at their prey. If they're not under the control of an external force, they will retreat when reduced to half health or lower or if it becomes obvious they are outmatched.

The supernatural bears have more complex tactics, as detailed below.

#### Ice Bear Tactics
Ice bears initiate combat by unleashing their ice wave ability and then targeting the physically weakest opponent restrained by the ice. If the ice bear isn't being controlled by another force, it will withdraw from combat if it fails to restrain any targets with its ice wave, or it loses half or more of its hit points within the first round.

#### Elemental Bear Tactics
Here are some things to keep in mind when using elemental bears:
* They are front-line fighters useful for tanking and crowd control
* Their Aura of Winter ability disrupts ranged attackers. So, elemental bears should try to close the distance with such enemies
* Ice Wave is its best opening move, followed by a bite attack on any restrained target
* Breath of Hail is a good follow-up move for the turn after Ice Wave is used since you can target everyone who's still restrained.
 * Breath of Hail is also useful for hitting foes who are staying out of range of Ice Wave if the bear can hit three or more enemies.
* Only use Frigid Bolt if there is no other way to attack enemies

#### Avatar of Winter Tactics
Here are some things to keep in mind when using the Avatar of Winter:
* The *soul of winter* spell is its best way of initiating combat, and it will cast it the most critical battlefield area as it isn't affected by the spell's adverse effects.
* The Claw of Ice with Grasp of Winter legendary actions can be used to pull targets back into the area of *soul of winter*.
* The Whirlwind of Frost action should be saved for situations where the bear is either unable to move or able to hit three or more enemies with it (assuming the bear ends up in a favorable location.)

### Bear Loot

The valuable items looted from bears will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Being elementals, most of an elemental bear's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the snow and dirt it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Bear Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Deer 
Existing across a vast range of environments in many forms, deer stand out as creatures of elegance, adaptability, and resilience. These graceful beings, ranging from the diminutive and sprightly to the majestic and formidable, embody a blend of agility, strength, and vigilance. 

Deer are also embodiments of agility and sensory acuity. Their lithe forms navigate the densest woods and roughest terrains with effortless grace. Keen senses — acute hearing and a robust sense of smell — keep them ever alert to potential threats, and their threats are many, for deer are often the favored prey of the many predators they share their homes with, from wolves to bears to humanoid hunters. 

Deer are such common prey that, for many humanoid cultures, they've come to be seen as symbols of the hunt. The stamina and endurance of these creatures are legendary. Capable of sustaining high-speed chases across vast distances, deer exhibit a remarkable blend of speed and endurance, qualities that have inspired countless tales and legends throughout the ages of great hunters pursuing particularly elusive deer.

However, deer are far from helpless prey. Adorned with impressive antlers, a hallmark of their kind, the male deer (and some females, depending on species) exhibit a natural prowess in their horned charge. These antlers, far from mere ornaments of courtship, serve as formidable weapons in territorial disputes and self-defense. The deer's charge, a spectacular display of speed and strength, showcases their ability to confront challenges head-on.

Should deer find themselves retreating from attackers, they can utilize their hardened hoofs to deliver a powerful back-kick. This swift and unexpected maneuver enables them to fend off predators and threats even in retreat. The deer's muscular hind legs, engineered for both fleet-footed escapes and potent defense, make them creatures not to be underestimated.

The following are examples of different types of deer across a variety of sizes and power levels. Though it's not a comprehensive list of every type of deer, most other types could still be represented using the stat block of one of the deer presented here.

### Fallow Deer
These deer are as elegant as they are adaptable and grace many landscapes with their presence. Fallow deer can be identified by their impressive antlers and distinctive coats, which are particularly striking, exhibiting a range of colors from light tan with white mottling to dark chocolate brown and sometimes even pure white. The males boast large, unique antlers that are broad and shovel-like, a feature that distinguishes them from other deer species. These antlers are a significant part of their identity, shed and regrown annually.

Fallow deer often form herds, which can be quite large in areas with few natural predators or in protected environments. Their diet primarily consists of grasses, herbs, and leaves, with grazing typically occurring at dawn and dusk. During mating season, males engage in displays of strength and dominance to attract females. This involves intense vocalizations and physical confrontations, a dramatic display of natural behaviors.

Fallow deer are skilled at adapting to various environments. Their ability to run swiftly and leap over obstacles serves them well in evading predators and navigating through different terrains. They are also vigilant and cautious, with keen senses that help them detect potential dangers, an essential aspect of their survival strategy.

In the realms they inhabit, fallow deer are admired for their beauty and the sense of tranquility they bring to their surroundings. Their grazing habits play a significant role in shaping the vegetation of their habitats, underlining their importance in the ecological balance of their ecosystems. Wilderness protectors such as druids and rangers ensure their numbers remain robust as they are vital to the health of their environment and provide an important food source to most large predators.

### Caribou
With their distinctive antlers and hardy nature, these animals epitomize the resilience and majesty of life in the harsh northern climates. Caribou are large deer, notable for both males and females possessing antlers, a unique trait among deer species. These antlers are grand and intricate, used for foraging in the snow and as a display during mating seasons. The coat of a caribou is dense and weather-resistant, varying in color but typically exhibiting shades of brown, gray, and white, providing excellent insulation and camouflage in their natural habitats.

Socially, caribou are known for their migratory habits, often traveling in large herds across vast distances. This migration is a spectacular sight and is driven by their search for food, mating opportunities, and calving grounds. Caribou diets are versatile, feeding on a variety of vegetation, including lichens, known as reindeer moss, grasses, and leaves, adapting their diet to the changing seasons.

The breeding season for caribou is a time of heightened activity. Males compete for females through displays of antler size and strength. They generally only give birth to a single calf at a time, and these calves grow quickly, a necessity for survival in the often harsh conditions of their habitats.

In terms of survival strategies, caribou are well-equipped for life in the challenging north. Their large, wide hooves are adapted for walking on snow and soft ground, acting like natural snowshoes. They are also excellent swimmers, an ability that aids them in crossing large rivers and lakes during their migrations.

Caribou play a significant role in their ecosystems. Their migration patterns and grazing habits have profound effects on the vegetation and overall health of the landscapes they traverse. Many northern tribes and civilizations use caribou as herd animals that are vital to their survival in the resource scarce north. As such, caribou come to hold major cultural significance and are featured in many legends and folktales of these peoples.

### Elk 
Known for their impressive stature and striking antlers, elk are among the largest species of deer, with males significantly larger than females. They are distinguished by their impressive antlers, which are some of the largest of any deer species, with a complex, branching structure. These antlers, shed annually, are not just a symbol of their strength but also play a crucial role during the mating season. The elk's thick coat changes from a light tan in summer to a darker brown in winter, providing  camouflage and insulation.

Elk are known for their herd behavior. While females and young typically form large herds, males may either join these herds or form smaller groups of their own. These herds are dynamic and can change in size and composition with the seasons. Elks' diet is predominantly grass-based, but they also feed on leaves, bark, and shrubs, showing adaptability in their feeding habits to suit the environment.

During mating season, bulls engage in dramatic displays of strength and dominance to attract mates, including bugling, a loud series of vocalizations, and displaying their antlers. Calves are born with spotted coats for camouflage, a critical survival trait in their early days.

Survival for elk involves a blend of physical prowess and keen instincts. Their large size and strength are their primary defenses against predators. Additionally, their acute hearing and sense of smell enable them to detect danger early. These senses, combined with their speed and power, allow them to fight or flee depending on the threat they face.

In the various realms they inhabit, elk are revered for their beauty and strength. Their majestic presence and mighty antlers make them a prized game for hunters, and many grand hunts focus center on the pursuit of a majestic elk. Creatures tied to the fey wild, such as elves, sometimes utilize elk as swift and powerful mounts, allowing them to gracefully bound through the wilds before crashing into foes with the antlers of their wild steed.

### Moose
The moose is the largest and most imposing of the <br> modern deer. With their towering stature and <br> distinctive antlers, moose command an imposing <br> presence in the landscapes they inhabit.

Moose are remarkable for their size, with males <br> being significantly larger than females. One of the <br> most striking features of the moose is its antlers, <br> which are the largest of any deer species. These <br> antlers, exclusive to males, spread impressively <br> wide and are shed annually. The moose's coat, thick <br> and coarse, varies in color from brown to black, <br> offering insulation against the cold climates they <br> often inhabit.

Moose are mostly solitary, except during the <br> mating season or when mothers are raising their <br> young. They wander alone through vast northern <br> territories, relying on their size rather than a herd <br> to protect them from predators. Moose are <br> herbivores, feeding on a diet rich in both aquatic <br> and terrestrial vegetation, including leaves, bark, <br> pine cones, twigs, and shoots. 

During mating season, male moose engage in <br> fierce competitions for the attention of females, <br> often involving physical displays and antler clashes. <br> Their calves grow rapidly, as size is a necessary <br> part of their survival strategy against the harsh <br> conditions and fierce predators they must endure.

Once they are fully grown, moose can rely on <br> their size and strength to fend off threats. Their <br> large antlers serve as a deterrent to predators, <br> and their long legs are capable of powerful kicks. <br> Moose are also excellent swimmers, an ability that <br> aids them in foraging for aquatic plants and <br> escaping predators.

As some of the most imposing creatures of their <br> northern habits, moose are often utlized as prized <br> guardians and steeds by druids. Moose are typically <br> not trainable by mundane means, and only those <br> with a supernatural connection to the wild can hope <br> to leverage their mighty.

### Megaloceros
These primeval deer dwell in remote time-lost tundras alongside other ancient megafauna. Megaloceros are one of the largest deer species to have ever lived, with males displaying a remarkable set of antlers, some of the largest in any deer species, both in width and length. These antlers, which can span up to 12 feet from tip to tip, are not only a display of dominance but a tool used in mating rituals and defense against predators. Their robust and muscular bodies are covered in a thick coat of fur that varies in color, aiding them in adapting to colder climates.

The social and breeding behaviors of the megaloceros are similar to those of other deer, with males vying with each other during mating season. The males use their impressive antlers to gain the attention of females and to establish dominance within their herds. These antlers also serve as a menecing warning to any who would threaten the herd.

Survival for megaloceros, given their size and habitat, involves a blend of sheer physical presence, speed, and honed senses. Their large antlers, while majestic, can present navigational challenges, particularly in maneuvering dense forests. As a result, megaloceros prefer to roam open grassy landscapes where they can leverage their size and speed.

### Ice Caribou

Deep within the frozen tundra, herds of large, pristine white caribou roam across icy fields. These magnificent creatures are distinguished by their elaborate horns crafted from pure ice, and their legs end in hooves covered in frost.

***Frost Feeders.*** In areas devoid of the hardiest vegetation, these caribou have adapted a unique diet. They appear to draw sustenance directly from the cold, feeding on fragments of glaciers and ice scattered across their habitat. Should a caribou wander into warmer regions, it risks withering and starvation due to the absence of its icy diet.

***Icy Antlers.*** The ice caribou have the extraordinary ability to rapidly grow their antlers at a moment's notice. In mere seconds, a bare-headed caribou can develop a full set of imposing, icy antlers, ready for battle. These antlers, while large and intimidating, can shatter easily upon strong impact, releasing a burst of freezing ice. This not only serves as a defense mechanism but also plays a crucial role in the males' combative displays during mating rituals. In these fierce duels, stags often break many sets of antlers against one another until one is left standing victorious.

***Icy Alliances.*** Ice caribou are far more intelligent than typical deer, and druids and fey have the ability to communicate with them, allowing for the formation of basic alliances. These typically involve agreements like safe passage through caribou territories or exchanging information about recent visitors to their icy realms. In some rare cases, more powerful beings like ice hags or arctic druids have managed to enlist herds of these caribou for more significant tasks, such as pulling enchanted sleds or serving as formidable guards against unwanted intruders.

### Cosmic Caribou
In the realm above, the cosmic caribou roam, creatures born of myth and cosmic light. Their bodies shimmer like the auroras, casting vibrant hues as they glide through the heavens. These reindeer, moving in majestic herds or guiding the sleighs of shamans, embody the celestial dance of the cosmos.

These caribou are more than celestial wonders; they are bearers of destiny. Legend holds that they appear to guide heroes and sages, transporting them across mystical landscapes.  Their arrival is seen as an omen, often signaling the start of epic quests or pivotal moments in the world's fate. Endowed with ancient wisdom, the cosmic caribou are sought after for their insight into the intricate weave of destiny and time.

However, their existence is a delicate balance. The cosmic caribou's wellbeing is believed to mirror the universe's equilibrium.

### Deer Tactics
Most deer, from tiny pudus to supernatural caribou, generally don't seek out combat as they are herbivores. If there is some supernatural compulsion driving them to attack, they will utilize hit-and-run tactics. They charge in with their horns before running out of reach to repeat the process on their next turn, using their Back Kick against anyone who makes an opportunity attack against them.

#### Ice Caribou
These creatures will focus on bringing down anyone capable of dealing fire damage. Their ice attacks help enable their hit-and-run tactics by slowing down their targets.

### Deer Loot
The valuable items looted from deer will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Most of an ice caribou's form will melt away when it is destroyed. Players can loot the insolvable bits of ice and melt water it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Deer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Kallikantzaroi
These diminutive fey look like black-furred goblinoids and sport beady red eyes, twisted horns, and small but sharp tusks. The appearance of a kallikantzaros might even be described as comical if not for the menacing wood-cutting hatchets they are almost never seen without. Most kallikantzaroi spend the majority of the year hibernating within the Feywild, seldom waking unless disturbed. When the winter solstice draws near, they rouse from their slumber and seek fey crossings into the Material Plane, where they can spread havoc. 

***Lost Goblinoid Kin.***  It is believed that kallikantzaroi were once goblins attempting to escape the wrath of their tyrannical gods by fleeing into the Feywild where they burrowed deep underground. Once there, they began feeding on the roots of powerful enchanted trees, which slowly turned them into the fey creatures they are known as today. 

If true, this would explain the kallikantzaroi's affinity for woodworking and digging hidden homes amongst forest groves. During most of the year, they chop away at magical tree roots around their home and sustain themselves on the enchanted tree sap they harvest. They've also developed a knack for evading detection by druids and other fey that view them as destructive pests.

***Winter Revelry.*** On the days near the Winter Solstice, kallikantzaroi will spring from the ground and find crossing into the Material Plane to go on their celebratory rampages. They have a taste for sweets, devouring them on sight and chopping apart anything that stands between them and a newly discovered treat. Sweetmeats are among their favorite meals, but they will also chop down trees to get at the sweet sap they prize, with the sap of evergreens being especially delicious to a kallikantzaros. 

Their attraction to sweets and evergreens inevitably draws kallikantzaroi to winter festivals, where they find an abundance of treats and holiday trees to feed on and chop apart. They make no attempt to bargain with the humanoids of these festivals, and as soon as they see an opportunity, kallikantzaroi will take and destroy all they can without ever being satiated. The kallikantzaroi will not leave until they’ve devoured every sweet and destroyed every tree unless driven out by force or the Winter Solstice comes to a close. Once the solstice comes to a close, the kallikantzaroi retreat to the Feywild for another year.

&emsp;***Drop Attackers.*** Kallikantzaroi love dropping out of trees and from rooftops onto their enemies whom they attach to, essentially forcing their victim to give them a piggyback ride. Once a kallikantzaros lands on its target’s back, it will mercilessly start lashing its victim with its axe. Many have fallen victim to these attacks while attempting to stop marauding kallikantzaroi from destroying festive trees or stealing from food shops. Kallikantzaroi will also drop onto unsuspecting targets cooking sweet foods such as ham or baked treats and lash the cook into submission before stealing their goods.

Kallikantzaroi rarely seek to lethally wound humanoids unless they are in a life-or-death fight and will usually only injure their victims as much as is necessary to prevent them from interfering with their revelry. Hacking apart objects and creatures that aren’t made of wood and devouring anything that isn’t sweet brings a kallikantzaros little joy.


***Kallikantzaros Foreman.*** Most kallikantzaros groups are led by at least one foreman. These kallikantzaroi fill the same role as goblin bosses, bullying other kallikantzaroi and keeping them in line. Most kallikantzaroi prefer to pilfer and destroy when others aren’t looking and will flee from formidable opponents, but the presence of a foreman can embolden them to become more aggressive in their tactics. Kallikantzaroi will fight more aggressively with a foreman leading them, and those who attempt to flee are caught and literally thrown back into the fray by their unforgiving boss.

## Owls
These nocturnal birds of prey are often seen <br> as symbols of wisdom and the ever-present perceptiveness of the wilds.  Though, among some cultures, they are instead viewed as cursed omens of death and misfortune.  Owls can be found swooping across snowy tundras or perched ominously on dead tree branches deep within dark forests, their everpresent hooting echoing through the night.   By day, they are beautiful and sometimes even adorable hunting birds.  But by night, their glowing eyes strike fear into the hearts of travelers, reminding them the wilds are always watching.

***Stealthy Hunters.*** Most owls are less than two feet in length and have wingspans ranging from 1 to 6 feet across.  As such, their primary prey tends to be small rodents and rabbits.  Owls spot their quarry in the dead of night using superior dark vision and hearing.  Their nocturnal prey often relies on hearing to detect predators.  To counter this, owls have developed specialized feathers which allow them to fly slowly and stealthily, catching their unsuspecting meal by surprise.

***Wizarding Familiars.*** The stealth and keen senses of the owl make it a popular familiar amongst magic users.  Its associations with wisdom further its appeal amongst those with scholarly inclinations.  Wizarding schools often make extensive use of owls in their symbology and as familiars used for information gathering and parcel delivery.  Amongst magic users with a more sinister bent, owls can also serve as menacing familiars to spy on enemies and inspire fear and paranoia amongst superstitious commoners.

> ##### Waterlogged Owls
> Unlike most other birds of prey, owls do not possess a waterproof undercoat.  While short periods in the rain won't hinder them, if they become soaked in water, their fluffy feathers will absorb so much of it that they become too heavy and waterlogged to fly.  Owls in this state are extremely vulnerable and must dry out before they can fly again.  If you wish to incorporate this in your games, you can include a rule that owls soaked in water lose their fly speed until they dry off.

&emsp;***Great Horned Owls.*** The great horned owl is among the most far-ranging and dangerous of all its kind. These deadly birds of prey can measure over two feet in length and sport five-foot wingspans. Their talons can deliver crushing forces ten times what a typical human can produce, allowing them to kill most small prey instantly. This hunting prowess allows great horned owls to hunt a wide range of prey with impunity, and some have even been reported hunting animals as large and dangerous as foxes and bobcats.

***Giant Owls.*** In some extremely wild and dangerous areas, man-sized owls hunt much larger prey than their mundane counterparts.  These beasts are favored guardians and companions to many woodland races, and smaller peoples, such as forest gnomes, will even use them as flying steeds.  When giant owls contact traveling humanoids, they will not hesitate to hunt them like any other animal.  Villagers living near giant owl territory rarely travel alone or unarmed and always keep an eye to the treeline. 

***Monstrous Owls.***  Some owls obtain supernatural levels of size and intelligence.  They may be part of a larger species of monstrous owls or may have once been typical owls that were transformed through magical means.  In either case, their enhanced abilities make them deadly foes and powerful allies.  These owls will often align themselves with other fey and intelligent woodland beings.  Some are noble guardians, working with druidic circles to watch over and safeguard the wilds.  Others are brutal killers, serving dark fey as spies and assassins while mercilessly hunting down any who trespass upon their wilds.

### Owlbears
These beasts are monstrous amalgamations of giant owls and grizzly bears.  Owlbears possess the stealthiness and deadly beak of a giant owl, the sheer size, power, and aggression of a grizzly bear, and the heightened senses of both.  They are fiercely territorial hunters and will attack almost anything that crosses their path without provocation.  However, through tremendous effort, some races can train owlbears as fierce guardians and terrifying battle mounts.

***Snowy Owlbears.*** This subspecies of owlbear is native <br> to arctic environments and appears  to be a combination of snowy owl and polar bear.  It behaves much like other owlbears, but its polar bear nature makes it somewhat larger and much heartier than its temperate cousins.  The harshness of its environment also makes it a deadlier and more determined hunter.  Snowy owlbears are unrelenting in their pursuit of prey, willing to climb treacherous mountains and swim through icy waters to secure their kills.

### Strix
All the omens and superstitions regarding owls are made manifest in the dreaded strix.  These fiends are quite literally living curses shaped into the form of a dread owl with glowing malevolent eyes and wings that move in an almost incorporeal and dreamlike fashion.  This leads some to believe they are creations of dark magic, used by wicked spell casters to hunt their victims.  Others believe them to be fiends native to the underworld sent to reap the souls of the damned.  Regardless of their origin or motivation, once a strix has marked someone for death, there is little hope of escaping its terrible curse.  

***The Dread Curse.*** Strixes are cursed omens of death given physical form, and they seek to spread their curse to others.  When a strix marks someone for death, it will stalk its victim, sometimes for nights on end.  This stalking involves waking up the victims with terrifying calls in the night and watching them through darkened windows with shining eyes.  When their prey's mounting dread reaches its peak, the strix will strike, its talons imparting a fatal curse.  The doomed individual then has twenty-four hours to live before their soul is violently ripped from their body by the curse.  The only way to break to curse is to hunt down the strix and nail it to a wooden door, dead or alive, using an iron nail.

***Servants of Dark Powers.*** Strixes often act in the service of dark masters.  Hags and witches may summon a strix to enact vengeance upon someone who has crossed them, underworld fiends may send strixes to collect souls they've won through dark dealings, and dark wizards may summon strixes to use as twisted familiars.  Regardless of its master or mission, the strix will act with a single-minded malevolent determination to carry out its dark purpose.

## Tigers
The largest and deadliest of all cats, tigers are <br> the kings of their domain. Their power and <br> beauty elevate them to an almost mythical <br> status amongst many humanoids.  Some view <br> them as the wrath of the gods made flesh, while <br> others see them as the ultimate predators <br> against which one can truly test their metal. 

***Predators Supreme.*** Tigers can reach over <br> 10 feet in length, and their intensely muscular <br> bodies can weigh nearly 700 pounds.  Due to <br> their sheer mass and power, few creatures <br> are safe from a tiger's predation. Thanks to the <br> tiger's striped camouflage and long pouncing <br> distances, even animals large and powerful <br> enough to pose a threat to a tiger rarely notice it <br> in time to mount an effective defense. Thanks to <br> their deadly ambush capabilities, tigers can hunt <br> down larger creatures as dangerous as mountain <br> gorillas and even brown bears.  

Once a tiger surprises its prey with a pounce, it will <br> knock its victim prone and use its claws and teeth to lock down and quickly finish the kill.   A prone victim has little chance of fighting back and is rapidly ripped apart before being dragged off by the tiger to be consumed. 

***Maneaters.*** While tigers primarily hunt animals living across jungles, forests, and occasionally mountains, they often hunt stray humanoids when the opportunity presents itself. A lone traveling humanoid will usually be seen as an easy meal to a tiger, and some may even be bold enough to attempt to pick off a humanoid traveling with a group.  Some notorious tigers take a personal liking toward hunting humanoids. A tiger that has been "wronged"  by someone will often make a point of hunting down and exacting vengeance upon the offender.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

These offenders are usually individuals who injured the tiger in a previous encounter or stole one of its kills. Other tigers will decide to make humanoids their primary prey.   These tigers will stalk the outskirts of isolated villages and pick off stray inhabitants, leaving the population terror-stricken.

&emsp;***Dire Tigers.*** These primeval terrors represent the dangerous aspects of the tiger amplified to a greater level of deadliness.  They are larger and more muscular than other tigers, reaching nearly 900 pounds.  They are bolder than other tigers and attack humanoids without hesitation, even those traveling in groups.  They are more resilient than other tigers, and even groups of veteran hunters often fail to slay these mighty beasts.

Many believe dire tigers to be the ancient cousins of "modern tigers" and remnants from a long-lost age.  Whatever their origin, they are often put to use by other beings who wish to punish or test the metal of humanoid adventurers.  Druids enlist the aid of dire tigers to protect their realms from unwanted incursions, and divine forces may unleash dire tigers upon mortals as a form of deadly punishment for their transgressions.

### Weretigers
These lycanthropes blend the hunting <br> prowess of a tiger with the intelligence <br> and versatility of a humanoid, creating <br> proud individuals who view themselves <br> as apex hunters.  
While not evil by nature, weretigers often have a <br> superiority complex that drives them to hunt all <br> manner of dangerous game to demonstrate <br> their place at the top of the food chain.  This <br> hunting is done with a detached refinement, and <br> weretigers will rarely revert to their bestial forms <br> if they can help it, preferring to remain calm and in control.  

Though weretigers become frustrated when pushed to the point of losing their cool and transforming into their bestial forms, deep down, they crave the challenge.  While a weretiger may take smug satisfaction from easily dispatching dangerous prey, a true challenge that pushes the limits of its abilities will be a treasured victory.  

Weretigers are also very careful about who they pass their lycanthropy to, as they view it as a privilege and a burden.  Weretigers have an exclusivist attitude and are loath to introduce unnecessary and unworthy competition.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, when weretigers find exceptional hunters or even humanoid prey that exceed their expectations, they may choose to pass their lycanthropy onto such individuals, thereby creating worthy rivals for future competitions.

> ***Regeneration.*** The weretiger regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the weretiger takes lightning damage or damage from a silvered weapon this trait doesn't function at the start of the weretiger's next turn. The weretiger dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

## Werewolves
These savage predators are the most common and notorious of all lycanthropes. By day, they are aggressive and hot-tempered humanoids with a penchant for rare meat and an affinity for canines. When their tranformation takes place, they either turn into large, bloodthirsty wolves or terrifying wolf-human hybrids, with lupine heads and fur on a vaguely bipedal humanoid body complete with long arms and slashing claws. Though their paw-hands in this form are capable of manipulating objects and wielding weapons, werewolves much prefer slashing apart their prey with their iron-hard claws. 

Their lycanthropic resilience also makes them almost impossible to kill. Outside of silvered weapons, the only known means of reliably slaying werewolves is through the use of powerful soundwaves which damage their sensitive lupine hearing.



***Ravagers of Civilization.***
Most who contract werewolf lycanthropy withdraw from civilization. Even those who embrace their curse and care nothing for the harm they cause know they can't maintain their guise among other humanoids for long because, when a werewolf's transformation occurs, it becomes the anathema of all things civilized. The veneer of principles and rationality melt away, and primal instincts take over. The overriding emotion werewolves often feel is rage towards the civilized society that keeps them chained beneath the surface for the majority of their life. As such, werewolves often prioritize hunting other humanoids as a way of exacting their vengeance on the shackles of civilization. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some humanoids embrace this hatred and actively seek to tear down civilization even when in their humanoid form. Others fight against it, trying to maintain their guise of civility, which only serves to fuel the fury of the wolf within. Others find a way to make peace with their inner beast, and while still savage at heart, they are able to channel their ferocity in a way that minimizes harm to other innocent sentient creatures.

***Pack Hunters and Lone Wolves.*** The wolf's tendency to run in packs carries over to werewolves, who often form hunting groups in the wild to better catch particularly dangerous or evasive prey. These werewolf packs utilize many of the same techniques as wolves: silently stalking prey, launching ambushes designed to frighten their victims into fleeing, and isolating targets for coordinated takedowns. These hunts are usually led by a powerful pack leader who picks out the target and coordinates the werewolves' attacks against that victim, ensuring a bloody kill. 

Other werewolves live a more solitary life, shunning the company of their kind. This might be done out of rejection of their curse, because they don't wish to share their kills, or because they work with other non-lupine creatures. Though this isolation helps lone werewolves become more dangerous in isolation than those accustomed to working with a pack, they lack the ability to utilize the pack tactics of their more sociable kin.

### Werewolf Moon Mystics

All werewolves feel a primal connection to the moon and the urge to unleash their bestial impulses follows its phases. Some introspective werewolves study and meditate upon this connection, plumbing the depths of their primal psyche and how it intertwines with the moon's phases. This path not only helps these werewolves to better temper and regulate their reckless bloodthirst, but allows them to channel lunar power through their body. 

These werewolves come to be known as moon mystics, and they are known for the serene grace with which they take on their lupine aspect and are even better known for their ability to dispatch foes with magical blasts of moonlight. The restraint moon mystics are capable of allows them to avoid diving right into the fray and target dangerous foes from a distance with their lunar bolts and burning moonbeams. 

The ascetic nature of these werewolves means they rarely participate in hunts with others of their kind and often live as contemplative hermits. However, when moon mystics do join or interact with werewolf packs, they often serve as spiritual leaders. Some mystics temper the aggression of their kin, but others will warp the social dynamic of their pack, giving it a cult-like dynamic as they lead disturbing rituals designed to pursue inscrutable goals.

(3/Day)*** *Ranged Spell attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) radiant damage and moonlight illuminates the target until the end of the werewolf's next turn. While illuminated this way, the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack roll against an affected target has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected target can't benefit from being invisible.
>
> ***Searing Moonlight. (1/Day)*** A pale beam of moonlight appears and fills a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 120 of the werewolf. The cylinder lasts as long as the werewolf maintains concentration on it, up to a minute (as if concentrating on a spell). The area of the cylinder is considered dimly lit. Any non-shapechanger that is caught in the area of the moonbeam when it first appears or that ends its turn within the moonbeam must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. It takes 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While maintaining concentration on this ability, the werewolf can use its bonus action to move the beam 30 feet in any direction.

Each ally within 120 feet of it that can hear can take the Dash as a bonus action until the end of its next turn. Each other creature within 120 feet of the werewolf must then succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the werewolf. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Werewolf Encounter Guide

Werewolves are the most common and iconic of lycanthropes, and players might encounter them while traveling through lonely roads and settlements along wild frontiers. They usually dwell in areas where civilization is at odds with the wilds, though some werewolves trying to avoid harming humanoids may dwell in the deep wilderness, and some brazen werewolves may live in the heart of civilization. 

Sometimes players will face werewolves who have unwillingly transformed during a full moon. They will lack the tactical options of a werewolf who has mastered its curse but will still use the wolfish tactics that come naturally to them. Werewolves who have embraced their curse are far more dangerous, as they can pass for humanoids until the time comes for them to reveal their deadly nature.

#### Werewolf Motivations
Because lycanthropes retain the intelligence of humanoids, their motivations can be broad and complex. Still, a werewolf's nature will inevitably shape its motivations and goals. Werewolves feel an innate drive to hunt and kill, with their ire directed towards humanoids of their own species in particular. Those who embrace this nature may seek the destruction of all things civilized. Those who reject their curse will have goals focused on suppressing their nature.

##### General Werewolf Motivations
* Hunting for food 
* Satisfying bloodlust
* Protecting territory

* Aiding packmates
* Ravaging civilization 
* Hiding or suppressing curse

##### Moon Mystic Motivations
* Anything in the pursuit of primeval spiritualism, including:
    *  Serving nature dieties
    * Providing spiritual leadership to other werewolves
    * Recovering ancient druidic relics


##### Tactics
Werewolves instinctually utilize many of the same tactics of ordinary wolfs. However, their humanoid intelligence and shapeshifting abilities allow them to implement these tactics in much more sophisticated ways. The specifics of these tactics will depend greatly on the types of werewolves and how much control they have over their shapeshifting abilities.

##### Engagement
Like wolves, werewolves prefer to stalk their prey, closing in as close as possible before their presence is known. When operating as a pack, they will surround their quarry to cut off as many avenues of escape as possible. If they can assume their humanoid forms, they may use deception to lure victims into isolated locations before shapeshifting and unleashing a surprise attack. However, this tactic doesn’t provide as much satisfaction as hunting in their bestial forms and is usually reserved for especially dangerous enemies.

##### Combat

Werewolves are highly aggressive combatants that leverage regenerative abilities to survive what would otherwise be reckless head-on assaults. A werewolf that picks its prey is relentless in its hunt. Enemies wielding silver or thunder magic may be avoided or singled out by a werewolf, depending on whether it is looking for an easy kill or the slaughter of its enemies entirely. 

**Pack Werewolves.** Werewolves operating in a pack will fight much the same way as wolves. When spotted by foes, they will attempt to drive their enemies into fleeing so they can run them down. Once werewolves close in on their prey, they will focus on a target that appears most vulnerable and attempt to isolate and surround it so they can utilize their pack tactics. 

These targets are most often enemy spell casters or other soft targets who can cause a lot of trouble for the werewolves. If there are enough pack members, the werewolves may send some of their group to harass and distract other foes while they finish off their priority victims. Any enemy wielding a silvered weapon or capable of dealing thunder damage becomes a priority target for werewolves, and they will surround and kill such a foe as quickly as possible.


**Packleaders.** If a packleader is present, it will usually use its Hunters Howl to force its foes to flee and to help its pack close the distance. The packleader will also be the one to set high-priority targets for the pack, and its Dogpile trait enables the werewolves to take down these targets that much faster.

**Lone Werewolves.** Lone werewolves lack access to the group tactics of pack werewolves but will otherwise use the same general tactics of other werewolves. They may work with other types of creatures in combat but don’t rely on having allies present to be effective at taking down soft targets.

\columnbreak

**Moon Mystics.**
Moon mystics will generally stay out of melee combat and hurl lunar bolts at high-priority targets that might be staying out of reach of the rest of the pack. They will, in turn, utilize their pack to keep enemies from reaching them so they can better utilize their ranged attacks and avoid losing concentration on Searing Moonlight.

If the opportunity presents itself, it is most efficient for moon mystics to start combat with their Searing Moonlight so they can use their bonus action each subsequent turn to control it while making other attacks. If one or more enemies are tied up in melee combat with other werewolves, the mystic will use its Searing Moonlight on those enemies to help whittle them down since it won't damage other werewolves. They may also use their Searing Moonlight on casters hiding away from combat in an attempt to force them to lose concentration on any ongoing spells. The mystic’s Pale Hex trait means Searing Moonlight can also be used to hamper the ranged abilities of snipers.


##### Retreat
Despite their bloodthirsty natures, werewolves have a strong sense of self-preservation. Their ravenous natures and regeneration will keep them fighting longer than wolves, though most werewolves will attempt to flee if they are reduced to less than half health or outnumbered by well-armed opponents. If a powerful figure such as a packleader or moon mystic commands the pack and is still in the fight, the other werewolves may continue fighting even if wounded or outnumbered. However, most werewolf leaders will attempt to withdraw their pack if they sense they are losing.

The presence of silvered weapons or thunder magic amongst their enemies will make werewolves more likely to flee if they are unable to put a stop to the source of the damage. However, even foes without silver of thunder may be able to beat werewolves into submission. And, a werewolf is unlikely to continue fighting an enemy if it can't gain the upper hand, even if that enemy has no clear way to slay it outright.

### Werewolf Loot Guide
Because lycanthropes revert to their humanoid form when they are slain, most of the valuable items players can collect from them will be worn items or items dropped by their former victims. These valuables may include standard coinage. 

#### Lootable Werewolf Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Werewolf Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Moon Mystic Items |  Intelligence (Religion) |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.


##### Example Item Names
| GP <br> Value  | Moon Mystic Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  5sp  | Sylvan Charm | 
|  1gp |  Pale Totem |  
|  5gp | Lunar Idol |  
|  10gp| Moon Stone |

#### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to harvest depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're harvesting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you don't want to require a check on the part of the players, you can instead roll a d20 with the modifier determined by the table to determine what the players find randomly.

##### Lone & Pack Werewolf Loot Table

## Wolves
These majestic and deadly hunters roam many of the world’s forests and tundras, using their brutally effective pack-hunting tactics to fell much larger and more dangerous animals. Wolves strike fear in the hearts of humanoids who venture too far into the wilds, and their notoriety has earned them a place as common monsters and villains in many fables and children’s tales. The sounds of distant howling will alert travelers that they are entering wolf territory, and few do so willingly unless traveling in a well-armed group. Any travelers who become lost and isolated in the woods will have little hope of survival should a pack of wolves pick up their scent.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


***Master Pack Hunters.*** 
Those who catch the attention of a wolf pack will often be oblivious to their peril as the pack silently stalks its prey, slowly closing in until they are noticed. Once the pack is spotted, it will close in and attempt to drive its prey into fleeing. Sufficiently powerful prey that stands its ground and proves intimidating enough may be able to drive the wolves away. Wolves that press the attack will attempt to separate the weakest-looking target from its companions and drag it to the ground, where it can be subdued with vicious bites. Even if the prey manages to flee, the wolves will relentlessly pursue it until they are able to surround and slaughter their victim.

&emsp; ***Fiercely Loyal Allies.*** The group dynamics and hunting strategies of wolves are similar enough to most <br> humanoids that they are often able to integrate <br> themselves into tribes living far from civilization. These wolves might live amongst druidic circles, barbarian <br> tribes to the north, orcish warbands, or goblinoid <br> warrens. Regardless of the group, the wolf's instinct <br> toward teamwork and loyalty to hierarchical packs leaves <br> it well suited to many vital roles. Wolves will serve their adopted families as sentries, hunters, and war beasts in combat. They are adept at following verbal and somatic instructions from their humanoid companions to <br> coordinate their efforts.

***Dire Wolves.*** These primeval wolves are a more <br> primitive and savage version of their modern kin. They are more often found in wilder regions that have remained untouched by civilization. Here, they prey on large game <br> as well as any humanoids attempting to eke out an <br> existence in the unforgiving wilds. Like ordinary wolves, <br> dire wolves are prized allies amongst any humanoids able <br> to humanoids able to tame or befriend them, though this <br> is a difficult and dangerous prospect for any without <br> druidic abilities. As dire wolves are often favored by gods <br> of winter or the hunt, they may also be sent to aid those <br> who curry the favor of such gods. Though, just are just as likely to be sent to hunt and devour those who displease <br> the gods by daring to challenge the might of the wilds.

### Ascendant Packleader


Wolves blend ferocity, beauty, and teamwork in such a way that many humanoids regard them with a sense of awe that borders on reverence. As such, they are a favored animal among many celestial beings and a common form for sacred beasts to assume. Ascendant packleaders are a form of divine wolf created to lead wolf packs on the Material Plane in service of a higher purpose. They may have once been ordinary wolves elevated to divine status or celestials who took on a lupine form when they entered the Material Plane. 

Once an ascendant packleader has taken command of a wolf pack, it leads its lupine brethren with supernatural efficiency. Packleaders can bark orders at their pack mates, enabling them to perform complex tactical maneuvers normally beyond the capabilities of such creatures, and their supernatural howls can break the resolve of prey while driving their allies to victory. 

Using these powers of command, the ascendant packleader also drives its pack to pursue higher-level goals normally beyond the comprehension of ordinary wolves. These goals may simply be to protect a sacred wood, or they may involve furthering large-scale agendas in service of a god or other divine being. The nature of these goals and the packleaders pursuing them are as varied as the gods they serve. Noble packleaders act in service to gods seeking to protect the sanctity of life and nature, while brutal packleaders sent by wicked gods of the wilds take cruel pleasure in hunting humanoids and undoing the works of civilization.

> ***Hunter's Howl (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).***  The packleader may move up to its speed before emitting a howl that terrifies its prey and rallies its pack. Up to 6 allies within 120 feet of the packleader can use their reaction to perform one of the options described in its Bark Order ability. They must all use the same option, which the packleader chooses. Each other creature within 120 feet of the packleader must then succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the packleader. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

>
> &#8226; It moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
>
> &#8226; It makes one melee weapon attack or unarmed strike. If the attack has advantage from at least two sources, and one of them is due to the target being prone, the attack deals an extra 7(2d6) damage.
>
> &#8226; If the creature is suffering an effect that requires it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its next turn, it immediately makes that save.

### Wolf Encounter Guide

Wolves are a classic, low-level enemy for fledgling adventurers to face in the wild. Dire wolves are larger and provide a greater challenge but operate in the same manner. Like most predatory beasts, players are likely to encounter wolves when they wander into a pack’s territory, a desperately hungry pack is hunting them, or the wolves are being used as war beasts by other humanoids. 

Regardless of the encounter’s circumstances, wolves rely on their numbers and pack tactics to overwhelm their foes. Wolves aren’t likely to attack humanoids unless they outnumber them or are starving. Dire wolves may be more brazen about attacking in smaller numbers due to their size advantage over humanoids. Still, even they aren’t likely to attack if their prey outnumbers them and appears in good condition. 

#### Wolf Motivations
Being beasts, wolves usually have straightforward motivations driving their goals. A wolf pack lead by an ascendant packleader may have a more complex agenda.

##### General Wolf Motivations
* Hunt for food
* Protect territory
* Act in service or protection of those it perceives as packmates

##### Ascendant Packleader Motivations
* Serve the sacred purpose it was created for


#### Wolf Tactics
While wolves may be beasts with simple motivations, they excel at hunting in packs and are capable of coordinated group tactics in combat. They utilize the same tactics when hunting in the wild or with humanoid masters.

##### Engagement

With their Keen Sense, wolves are likely to detect potential prey before they themselves are noticed. The wolves will then attempt to stalk and stealthily approach their prey, closing in as close as possible before being seen. Once spotted, the wolves try to drive their prey into fleeing. They may use intimidation or run at a target in an attempt to spook it, but they prefer to stay out of striking distance of creatures standing their ground. 

\columnbreak

##### Combat

If one or more creatures run, the wolves will chase after them unless isolated targets are left behind for the wolves to surround. If multiple creatures scatter, the wolves will close in on one target. Wolves will chase prey long distances, exhausting their victims before closing in for the kill. If a wolf can close the distance, it will attempt to use its trip attack, hampering the target’s ability to flee and giving other wolves a chance to close in from all sides.

If all the creatures stand their ground, they make themselves much less appealing prey to the wolves. The pack may attempt to isolate and surround one target if it looks like they can get a quick kill. If their prey poses a formidable threat to the wolves, they are unlikely to attack unless starving or under some supernatural influence. 


**Ascendant Packleaders.**
If an ascendant packleader leads the wolf pack, they will operate with a higher level of tactical complexity. They typically initiate combat with their Hunter’s Howl, which not only helps their allies close distance on prey but frightens the prey into running, setting up the chase scenario wolves prefer. They can then use their Bark Orders bonus action during combat to keep their pack mates in the action and focusing on high-priority targets.

##### Retreat

If the wolves do engage in combat, they will usually be quick to flee if it appears the tide is turning against them. Any individual wolf is likely to flee once it loses 10 percent of its health unless it is desperately hungry, in which case it may fight until it has lost 50 to 60 percent of its health. If half or more of a wolf pack has fled and their opponents still appear to be in fighting condition, the remaining wolves will typically retreat.

**Ascendant Packleaders.**
Wolves being led by an ascendant packleader will often fight to the death so long as their leader commands them. The packleader will usually call for a retreat if the pack is losing the fight unless doing so would violate their sacred duty. If the packleader is slain, the wolves may go mad and attempt to avenge its death or revert to acting like normal wolves and retreat.

### Wolf Loot Guide
Wolves generally won’t carry items, so most of their loot will take the form of whatever can be harvested from their bodies.

#### Lootable Wolf Items
The following table lists the types of materials likely to be harvested from wolves and the suggested skills your players can use to attempt their harvest.  If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

#####  Wolf Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
|  Hide  |Dexterity (Leatherworker's Tools) or Wisdom (Survival) |
|  Flesh | Dexterity (Cook's Utensils) or Wisdom (Survival)  | 
|  Blood or Bone | Intelligence (Medicine) or Wisdom (Survival)  |  



<br>The number of items harvested and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their harvesting check. You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.




\columnbreak


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Hide |Flesh | Blood | Bones |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  5sp  | Tattered Wolf Pelt | Stringy Wolf Meat  | Clotted Wolf Blood | Fractured Wolf Bones | 
|  1gp |  Wolf Pelt |  Wolf Meat  | Wolf Blood | Wolf Bones |
|  5gp | Pristine Wolf Pelt |  Wolf Heart  | Pristine Wolf Blood | Pristine Wolf Bones |
|  10gp| Runic Wolf Pelt |  Primeval Wolf Heart  | Primeval Wolf Blood | Runic Wolf Bones |



#### Wolf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to harvest depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're harvesting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time. 

If you don't want to require a check on the part of the players, you can instead roll a d20 with the modifier determined by the table to determine what the players find randomly.




##### Wolf & Dire Wolf Loot Table

## Wolverines
Wolverines are the largest members of the weasel family, with body lengths that can reach over 4 feet and weights reaching 55 pounds. They have a stocky and muscular build, with short legs, broad and rounded heads, small eyes, and short, rounded ears. Their fur is thick, dark brown, and often has a light brown stripe running down each side of their body. They have powerful jaws that can bite through bone and sharp claws that allow them to burrow through dirt.

Wolverines are found in remote reaches of the northern boreal forests and subarctic and alpine tundras, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to different environments. Their dense fur and snowshoe-like paws allow them to traverse harsh snowy environments, and they are known for their ability to travel great distances, often through harsh terrain and severe weather. This is a necessary adaptation as wolverines are solitary animals with large territories that they mark with scent. These territories can range from 50 to 10 square miles for females and up to 240 for males.

Wolverines have potent scent glands that they use for marking their territory and communicating with other wolverines. These glands secrete a strong, musky odor. The scent from these glands is used to mark their large territories. This marking serves as a warning to other wolverines and animals to stay away. It's particularly important since wolverines are solitary animals and require large areas for foraging. To humanoids, the smell of a wolverine's scent marking is often described as quite unpleasant and pungent. 

They are omnivores with a diet that includes carrion, small animals, birds, fish, and vegetation. They are also capable of taking down prey larger than themselves, such as weak or injured deer. Wolverines have a reputation for being aggressive hunters, often defending their food aggressively against larger predators. They are notoriously tenacious and fierce, usually standing their ground against overwhelming odds.

### Megalictis
Known colloquially as dire wolverines, these primeval creatures are larger and more fearsome relatives to the modern wolverine. The megalictis other wolverines and is a terrifying sight to behold. With a body length that can reach up to 2 meters (over 6 feet) and a weight approximating that of a large modern-day predator, this beast combines the ferocity of a wolverine with the stature of a jaguar. 

The megalictis is a solitary and highly territorial creature with a vast hunting range, covering extensive swathes of forest and tundra. It marks its territory with a potent scent, more intense than that of any modern mustelid, serving as a clear warning to any who dares to trespass. 

With powerful jaws and robust teeth, the megalictis is an apex predator of its domain, hunting large prey, using its immense strength and surprising agility to take down animals much larger than itself. This predator is not one to be challenged lightly; tales of its hunting prowess are the stuff of legend among the tundra-dwelling cultures who share its home.

### Werewolverines
Few lycanthropes exhibit the savagery and fearlessness seen in werewolverines, and victims of their curse become battle-hungry seekers of bloody combat. Even the two natural weaknesses of werewolverines, silver and fire, cannot deter them when they are consumed by the frenzy of their curse.

***Warrior Nomads.*** Most werewolverines are solitary by nature, roaming frigid tundras or remote mountains alone. However, they possess an insatiable desire to confront the most formidable opponents they can find, traveling great distances from one fight to the next and leaving a trail of bloodshed in their wake. Legends from these frozen lands tell of werewolverines appearing before villages and tribes, demanding challenges from their mightiest warriors. 

These creatures often terrorize the communities, extorting food and treasure before moving on. When a werewolverine encounters a worthy adversary within a community, it may bite them, spreading its curse. The bitten individual is allowed to live but is marked for future confrontation, with the hope that they may one day provide a worthy challenge.

***Lycanthrope Hunters.*** Werewolverines pose a special threat to other lycanthropes they encounter. Werewolverines often carry silver-tipped javelins, as they view werewolves, werebears, and even other werewolverines as truly worthy kills. Most other lycanthropes consider werewolverines to be deranged and avoid them at all costs, even relinquishing territory and resources to appease these fearsome creatures.

### Burning Rage Wolverines
In the frozen expanses of the world, where massive beasts roam amidst icy tundras, one creature instills fear even in these formidable inhabitants—the burning rage Wolverine. This creature takes the form of a massive wolverine, engulfed in noxious flames that reek of sulfur. Its claws blaze with heated brimstone, causing the ice and snow beneath its paws to melt away.

***Ice Hunters.*** The fiery claws and teeth of the Burning Rage Wolverine make it a perfect hunter of the large ice beasts and creatures that dwell in the cold corners of the world. These creatures rely on these hunts to sustain their supernatural flames. Among their prey are ice caribou, yetis, frost salamanders, and occasionally, even frost wurms and young tundra-dwelling dragons have fallen victim to their relentless appetite. Their affinity for icey creatures even drives them to hunt wizards and druids who wield ice magic. 

***Charred Homes.*** Beyond their fiery claws, they possess the ability to release waves of scorching stench that can overwhelm creatures adapted to colder climates. This noxious stench can be launched over great distances in explosive bursts, poisoning and burning their unfortunate victims.

When a burning rage wolverines successfully bring down particularly massive prey, they carve out the creature's body and repurpose it into a new dwelling. These repurposed corpses serve as shelter, keeping them warm and sustaining them through the harshest winter seasons. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Sometimes, they also serve as a home for a mating pair to give birth to their young. Adventurers should exercise caution if they come across a charred corpse in the midst of the tundra, as burning rage wolverines are fiercely territorial and will not tolerate any intruders near their abodes.

On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) fire damage and is poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 12), the creature is stunned until the poison ends. A creature that has resistance to fire damage has advantage on the saving throw, and a creature that is immune to fire damage automatically succeeds. A creature that has vulnerability to fire damage has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and 14 (4d6) fire damage and is covered in the toxic spray for the next minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't covered in spray. Until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the spray off itself or another creature, it has the wolverine's Choking Smog ability (the creature is subjected to its own Choking Smog at the start of each of its turns).

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  4  | **Primeval Spirits:** The players come across a small town haunted by spirits believed to be the echoes of ancient megalictises that roamed the area in ages past. Superstitious locals think the spirits of these "dire wolverines" are returning in the flesh to hunt the intruders in their territory.   |
|  5  | **The Scorched Tundra:** The adventurers stumble upon a tundra that has been scorched and melted, with local wildlife devastated. The cause is a Burning Rage Wolverine, which must be tracked and dealt with before it turns the entire region into a wasteland. |
|  6  | **The Ice Mage's Request:** An ice mage seeks a component found only within the body of a Burning Rage Wolverine for a powerful spell to counter a growing fire elemental threat. The adventurers are hired to hunt one of these creatures and retrieve the needed component.|

|  12  | **Curse of Fury:** One of the adventurers or a key NPC has been bitten by a werewolverine and is now marked for a future confrontation. The party must seek a cure for the curse or prepare for the inevitable battle when the werewolverine returns.|

\pagebreakNum



### Wolverine Tactics
Wolverines rely on sheer ferocity to defeat their opponents and aren't afraid to confront creatures that are larger or tougher, especially if there's a potential meal at stake. In one-on-one combat, wolverines always employ their reckless attack feature. However, when facing multiple foes, they opt not to use this feature.

#### Burning Rage Wolverines Tactics:
These elementals generally employ the same tactics as regular wolverines. However, when faced with overwhelming numbers, they may initiate the encounter with their Sulfur Spray to even the odds.


**Burning Rage Wolverine Alpha Tactics.**
This variant utilizes its legendary move actions to close the distance with opponents. Once in range, it relies on its Slash legendary action to initiate melee combat. If its opponents prove to be evasive or are out of reach, the alpha will prioritize recharging its Sulfur Spray ability.

#### Werewolverine Tactics

Werewolverines are typically solitary creatures, although they may occasionally have a few underlings whom they've coerced into serving them. These lycanthropes tend to adopt the tactics of their namesake, the wolverine (described above). 

In combat, they focus their ferocity on a single target, usually one they deem worthy of carrying their curse. They rely on their claws and avoid using their bite attack until the targeted individual reaches half health or two rounds have passed without the opponent dying or being rendered unconscious. This delay signifies the werewolverine's recognition of the target's worthiness to bear its curse.

\columnbreak

### Wolverine Loot
The valuable items looted from wolverines will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Being elementals, most of a burning rage wolverine's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the burnt stone and ashes it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Because lycanthropes revert to their humanoid form when they are slain, most of the valuable items players can collect from werewolverines will be worn items or items dropped by their former victims. These valuables may include standard coinage. These items can be found using a **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Wolverine Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Yule Cats
Stalking villages in harsh winter environments, the yule cat strikes terror into the hearts of those who would skirt their responsibilities near the holiday season. The monster appears to be a typical fluffy cat, except it is roughly the size of a polar bear. Its yellow eyes glow with fiendish malice, betraying its unnatural origin, and its teeth and claws are capable of ripping through villagers with ease. 

***Hunters of the Indolent.*** Yule cats primarily stalk towns in cold, harsh environments, usually as significant holiday events approach. The yule cat will look for villagers with a specific identifier that indicates they have shirked their duties that year. The most common identifier is someone lacking new clothes, as this implies the individual didn't adequately aid the community in preparing clothes for the coming winter. 

However, these identifiers can vary depending on the traditions and economic exports of the village. In a town known for crafting and trading jewelry to survive, the yule cat may instead target villagers without any form of newly crafted jewelry on their person. Whatever the indicator, the yule cat will ruthlessly hunt and kill these individuals, whether men, women, or children.

***Winter Stalkers of Unknown Origin.***
While yule cats are fiendish in nature, their origins are not wholly known. Some claim they are the pets of mountain-dwelling hags and giants sent to torment lazy humanoids. Others believe them to be divine punishment resulting from villagers not doing their part to help the community in times of hardship.

Regardless of their origin, yule cats invariably roam wintery environments using feline hunting methods to prey upon their targeted villagers. Despite their large size, yule cats can easily blend into snowy landscapes, even hiding within snow flurries with supernatural ease. Victims will often be within pouncing range before they notice the fiend, even while within the supposed safety of their village.

If a yule cat's victim notices it and attempts to escape, the fiend can freeze its target in place with a dreadful glare.  Once its prey is paralyzed, the yule cat will take its time tormenting and playing with its soon-to-be meal.  Some yule cats will even allow their prey the illusion of escape just before making the killing strike.

|  1  | A town's citizens have become indolent, falling behind on producing needed clothes for the coming winter.  A town elder has summoned the yule cat to teach the population a harsh lesson.|
|  2  | A hag gives out clothes to poor children living in rags.  The children who refuse her gifts and continue wearing their rags are hunted by her pet yule cat.   |
|  3  | A sadistic and fashion-obsessed bard has gained control of a yule cat.  Townsfolk who fail to keep up with the latest clothing trends are hunted by the beast. |
|  4  | A yule cat is the favored pet of a vain cloud giant who lords over a dwarven mining village.  Dwarves who don't adorn themselves with newly mined gems each year are hunted by the cat.  |
|  5  |A village regularly wracked by storms must repair its homes each year.  The yule cat destroys any home left in disrepair and devours its inhabitants.  |
|  6  | A toymaker has devised a way to ensure his employees stay focused on making enough goods for the coming holiday: workers who fail to meet their quotas are hunted by a yule cat. |

> ***Keen Sight.*** The yule cat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The yule cat makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the yule cat can't attack another target.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 24 (4d8 + 6) piercing damage.  If the target is prone, it takes 42 (8d8 + 6) piercing damage instead.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 19 (2d12 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Winter's Gaze.*** The yule cat targets one creature it can see within 100 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute unless it is wearing new clothing it received within the last month. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Winter's Gaze of all yule cats for 1 hour.

> ##### Beyond Simple Clothing
> The Holiday Clothing and Winter's Gaze features are built around the assumption you are running a traditional Yule Cat from Islandic folklore that hunts individuals based on their clothing.  This legend is likely rooted in the fact that clothing production was a vital aspect of daily life for the Islandic villages where this tale originated.  You can modify these abilities to focus on a different feature that better suits the primary industry or customs of the town being terrified by the yule cat.  The primary theme of the yule cat is that it hunts those who have not done their part for the village.  You can adapt it to identify these individuals in a way that makes the most sense for your setting.
