# Bonus Fel Dwarf Creatures

## Fel Dwarf Artificers


Among the merciless society of the Fel Dwarfs, infernal artificers exemplify the cruel ingenuity born from such a culture. Only the demonsmiths and sorcerer-prophets surpass them in crafting weapons of suffering. These hellish artisans are vital to the ceaseless creation of war machines that fuel the ambitious conquests of the Fel Dwarfs.

Although they do not wield brutal sorcery like their demonsmith masters, Fel Dwarf artificers possess extensive knowledge of the dark arts, alchemy, and metallurgy. They use this expertise to fabricate handheld versions of their unholy siege weapons—devices so cursed that only the artificers themselves can wield them. While it may seem that these contraptions are restricted to their creators to prevent their use against the Fel Dwarfs, the dark truth is far grimmer. During the forging process, a portion of the artificer’s soul is bound to the weapon, creating a dangerous connection. Even after the weapon's completion, its use erodes the wielder's soul and body, with prolonged exposure leading to horrific mutations or gradual petrification from within.


### Doomquake Battle Smith
The doomquake battle maul incorporates the devastating power of the doomquake mortar into a two-handed weapon. Artificers who wield these weapons in battle are a destructive force, capable of toppling stone walls with shockwaves that ripple out from every strike, pulverizing everything in their path. These weapons can also be slammed into the ground, causing the earth to buckle and shatter. Those unfortunate enough to stand on the unstable surface are swallowed by a churning sea of roiling earth.

### Magma Cannoneer
Using the same twisted alchemy as the magma cannon, magma spewers deliver gruesome deaths on the battlefield. These contraptions consist of a canister strapped to the artificer's back, constantly emitting black fumes and a sinister hissing sound. Tubes extend from the canister to a large nozzle, held by the artificer, which sprays molten metal capable of engulfing an entire regiment in seconds.

### Deathscreecher Artillerist
Deathscreecher artillerists bombard their enemies with blasphemous ammunition derived from deathscreecher rockets. These Fel Dwarfs load handheld mortars with demolition rockets capable of felling a hill giant on impact. Alternatively, they can choose the more wicked dreadfire rockets, which release a hord of burning souls. These spectral entities howl through the air, seeking out the nearest living beings to incinerate.



### Fel Dwarf Artificer Tactics

The following tips can help you run fel dwarf artificers in combat more effectively:

#### Doomquake Battle Smith
* Excels at disrupting melee combatants and pairs well with ranged allies.
* Uses Doomquake Slam to create difficult terrain:
    * Position the slam so enemies are near the far edge of the area as this hinders enemy movement toward the battle smith and allies.

#### Magma Spewer
* Targets tightly packed groups of enemies, especially those with low Dexterity.
* Performs exceptionally well in chokepoints:
    * Use Resolute Stance to hold the line effectively.

#### Deathscreecher Artillerist
* Seeks opportunities to:
    *  Target three or more enemies.
    *  Target at least two enemies with low Wisdom using the Frighten ability.
* Forces enemies within 60 feet of the cannon to flee.
    *  Be cautious not to let allies pursue fleeing enemies into danger.
*  Uses Demolition Rocket in situations where crowd control is not possible.

> 
> ***Doomquake Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of the dwarf's next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, it takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage, and the energy dissipates.  
> 
> ***Doomquake Slam (3/Day).*** The dwarf slams the ground with its Doomquake Maul, creating a 15-foot cube of burning earth originating from itself. Each creature in the cube must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, 9 (2d8) fire damage, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared and the area vibrates violently until the start of the dwarf's next turn. At that point, the vibrations end in a calamitous burst, and each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) thunder damage. On a success, it takes half damage. 
>
> ### Bonus Actions  
> ***Resolute Stance.*** At the start of the dwarf’s turn, it becomes Resolute* until the start of its next turn.
>
> **New condition described below*



### Doomquake Battle Smith Upgrade

The Doomquake Battle Smith can have any of the following upgrades. Its challenge rating (CR) increases by 1 for each upgrade it has.

##### Doomquake Battle Smith Upgrade
| d3  | Upgrade |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Deafening Thunder.***  Creatures sheathed in booming energy or standing in a vibrating area are deafened and cannot cast spells with a verbal component. A creature that fails a Constitution saving throw suffers these effects until the end of the dwarf’s next turn.
|  2  | ***Shockwave.***  The area of the Doomquake Slam increases to a 60-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line originating from the dwarf.
|  3  | ***Seismic Snare.*** When a creature fails the Dexterity saving throw against the Doomquake Slam while standing on earth or stone, it becomes buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature is restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check. A creature making this check has advantage if it has a burrow speed.|

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Caustic Tar.*** A creature ignited by the Magma Spray ability is also restrained. If a creature uses its action to douse the flames, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength check. On a failure, the flames are not extinguished.
|  2  | ***Pyretic Acid.***  The magma cannoneer now deals acid damage instead of fire damage. Whenever a creature takes acid damage from the magma cannoneer, any armor it is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.
|  3  | ***Stinking Sulfur.*** Each creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of an ignited creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its current turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature is Dazed (see new condition) and can’t cast spells other than cantrips.|

\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

>
> ***Dread Fire Rocket (3/Day).*** The dwarf fires a cursed rocket from its launcher at a point of its choice within 120 feet but no less than 15 feet away. The rocket explodes, creating a 15-foot-radius sphere of burning souls. At the start of the dwarf's next turn, the sphere moves up to 30 feet toward the nearest creature before disappearing. 
>
> Any creature in the sphere when it appears or creature whose space the sphere moves into must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw.

## Infernal Defenders
Infernal defenders are cruel guardians fashioned by fel dwarf artificers using unholy methods similar to those employed in creating infernal destroyers. A lesser demon is bound into a body forged of metal and stone. These forms vary in shape, ranging from steel hounds with snapping jaws to brass bulls with searing horns, or vaguely humanoid figures twisted from obsidian.

Though these creations burn with the hatred of their imprisoned demons, they remain unwaveringly loyal to their masters, unleashing onslaughts of terrible fire upon their enemies. On command, the demon can channel its suppressed fury into another creature, allowing the recipient to deliver unnaturally brutal strikes at the cost of their own body, which is torn apart by the demon’s rage.

### Infernal Defender Tactics
The following tips can help you run infernal defenders in combat more effectively. In combat the infernal defender:
* Stays near its creator as a pseudo-protector and supporter.
* Utilizes Rebuke Attack to defend its allies.
* Employs Strain ability when commanded; it's most effective when used on targets:
    * Capable of dealing at least 20 damage with a single attack. (e.g., Deathscreecher Artillerist)
    * Possessing powers associated with their strikes (e.g., Doomquake Battle Smith.)

### Infernal Defender Variants

The type of demon bound to the construct can vary. You can apply one of the following abilities to the infernal defender to represent this, increasing its challenge rating (CR) by 1.

##### Infernal Defender Variants
| d3  | Ability |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Forge-Bound Demon.***  Creatures holding a metal object have disadvantage on saving throws against the Defender’s Rebuke attack. Additionally, if a creature fails a saving throw against the Rebuke Attack, a metal object of the Defender’s choice the creature is holding becomes red-hot for the next minute. A creature holding a object heated this way has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks unless it is immune to fire damage.|
|  2  | ***Shadow-Bound Demon.***  The defender now deals psychic damage instead of fire damage and is immune to psychic damage instead of fire damage. Its Rebuke Attack forces a creature to make a Wisdom saving throw instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, if a creature fails the save, it is blinded, in addition to taking damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.|
|  3  | **Hunger-Bound Demon.** The defender now deals necrotic instead of fire damage and is immune to necrotic damage instead of fire damage. Its Rebuke Attack forces a creature to make a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the Defender heals a creature of it's choice within 5 feet of it a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by its Rebuke Attack. |

## Doom Cannons
A terrifying fusion of demon and war machine, the doom cannon stands as the pinnacle of fel dwarf siegecraft. This nightmarish engine is created by binding the soul of a powerful demon into brass and iron. The imprisoned spirit grants the cannon a horrifying semblance of life—groaning and shaking with unearthly hatred, yearning only for destruction.

These cursed weapons are overseen by sadistic engineers, typically fel dwarfs, who do not merely crew the doom cannon but rather guide it as one would a rabid beast. They feed the war machine freshly slain bodies, shoveling corpses into its rear chamber. Within the infernal mechanism, flesh and bone are swiftly liquefied, their souls extracted to fuel its chaotic flames. These unnatural fires erupt from the cannon’s maw,  scorching the battlefield and warping anything unfortunate enough to be caught in their wake.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Among the deadliest instruments in the fel dwarfs’ arsenal, doom cannons are often sold to unholy warbands in exchange for vast hoards of slaves or plundered wealth. Tribes of fiend-worshipping marauders and orders of dark knights frequently employ them as artillery in their accursed crusades. However, those who wield these monstrous weapons must eventually pay the true price of their power.

Even with experienced handlers, the safeguards meant to contain the demon within inevitably fail. Many doom cannons have surged forward into enemy lines, abandoning their handlers in fits of uncontrollable bloodlust. At other times, the chaotic energies within grow unstable, causing deadly magical disruptions or leading to catastrophic explosions that consume all nearby—friend and foe alike. Some turn upon their own masters, scarring their minds with unspeakable horrors—or worse, drag them screaming into their fiery cores, where their souls remain trapped within the infernal machine.

### Ice-Forged Doom Cannon
In the cursed, frostbitten lands where malevolent forces hold sway, the fel dwarfs devised a chilling variant of the doom cannon: the ice-forged doom cannon. Unlike its fiery counterpart, this dreadful siege engine is crafted by subjugating the living nightmares that haunt the frozen wastes.

When fed a corpse, the engine grinds the body into crimson ice shards, transmuting the remains into its deadly ammunition.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

It then unleashes them in a merciless barrage of unholy frost. This accursed ammunition mercilessly drains the warmth and vitality from its victims, leaving only frozen husks behind.

Many savage barbarian tribes dwelling in these forsaken lands pay exorbitant sums to acquire such weapons, and survivors of an ice-forged doom cannon’s onslaught often find themselves swiftly overwhelmed by zealots of the dark gods.

### Doom Cannon of Damnation
The doom cannon of damnation is an even more powerful iteration of the doom cannon—an exceedingly rare and perilous creation, requiring the greatest mastery of dark artificers. Unlike its predecessors, this monstrous weapon does not merely rain fire or ice upon its enemies; instead, it unleashes torrents of soul-rending energy.

Those caught in its malignant blasts have their very essence wrenched from their bodies, their souls drawn into the cannon to fuel its devastating black magic. A single doom cannon of damnation can reap the souls of entire armies, trapping them within its iron frame to perpetuate its insatiable hunger.

\columnbreak

<br>

Yet, for all its devastating power, even the most ruthless warlords hesitate to wield such a weapon. Should the demon within ever break free, the consequences would be catastrophic. There are whispers of a battle where one such cannon escaped its handlers' control, feasting indiscriminately upon all combatants. When the dust settled, nothing remained of the armies that had clashed—only the doom cannon of damnation itself, rolling onward across the land, with the souls of every fallen warrior stowed within its depths.

### Doom Cannon Mishap Table

| d6  | Mishap Name         | Mishap Effect |
|:----:|:------------------|:--------------|
| **1**  | Demonic Rush | The cannon must move toward the closest non-bound creature it can see and then use its action to make a slam attack against it if the creature is within range. If the creature is not within range, it takes the Dash action to move closer to the target. |
| **2**  | Fel Feedback | The cannon's energies backlash, disrupting the winds of magic. Until the end of its next turn, the cannon cannot use its Fire! ability, and any creature that attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher within 300 feet of the cannon must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) force damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted. |
| **3**  | Vengeful Rampage | The cannon lashes out, using its action to make a slam attack against each creature within 5 feet. |
| **4**  | Pulse of Terror | The cannon's demonic essence instills terror in those around it. Each creature bound to the cannon within 30 feet becomes frightened of it until the end of the cannon's next turn. While frightened, affected creatures cannot take reactions and must use the Dash action on their turn, moving away from the cannon by the safest available route. |
| **5**  | Unstable Blast | The cannon's speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn. Its Fire! ability recharges and must be used this turn. All creatures targeted by the blast have disadvantage on the saving throw. |
| **6**  | Free at Last! | The cannon explodes, destroying itself. Each creature within 30 feet suffers the effects of its Fire! ability as if they were in its blast radius and have disadvantage on the saving throw. |

### Doom Cannon Tactics
Doom cannons are usually operated by Fel Dwarf engineers who keep them supplied with corpses. When well-fed, they stay back and bombard enemies from a distance.

If they run out of bodies, their handlers let them charge into enemy lines to refuel. When left on their own, doom cannons have no tactics, only an uncontrollable urge to destroy.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|

## Fel Dwarf Dreadnaughts
*Possessed Dwarves Entombed Within Iron War Suits*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>

Among the many unholy practices embedded in fel dwarf society, few are as perilous or profane as the binding and enslavement of demonic entities. Within blasphemous forges, forge-workers perform dread rites under the direction of demon-smiths—dark rituals that summon malevolent spirits from other worlds and bind them into metal, infusing weapons and war machines with diabolical power.

These procedures are extremely hazardous. The summoned fiends viciously resist their captors, struggling to break free and wreak vengeance on those who would subjugate them. When such incantations go awry, the demon may possess any flesh-and-blood participant in the summoning—even the demon-smith themselves. The possessed are plunged into agony and hatred, driven into berserk rages by the invading essence. They lash out at everything nearby, attempting to slaughter all within reach before being subdued or consumed by the torment wracking their bodies.

To salvage such disasters, demon-smiths act swiftly. The possessed victim is restrained and forcibly grafted into a hastily forged exoskeleton of iron. Enchantments are laid upon the frame to tether the struggling soul within and suppress the demon’s full control. But the dwarf is not freed from suffering. Instead, they are forever bound to their armor—a living furnace fueled by the demon trapped within their flesh, gnawing at the edges of their mind.

\columnbreak

<br>

These malformed fusions are known as Dreadnoughts—living engines of destruction. No longer truly dwarfs, they serve the demon-smiths without hesitation, living only to spread the agony they themselves endure. They lash out at any foolish enough to oppose the fel dwarf empire. Their forged forms can withstand immense punishment; only those cunning or fortunate enough to pierce the armor and strike the dwarf buried within can end their miserable existence.

### Molten Dreadnaughts
The torment endured by molten dreadnoughts is used to heat their blackened metal bodies until they burn red-hot, boiling the air around them and igniting any who draw their ire. Their metal gauntlets sear flesh on contact, and built-in tanks release torrents of boiling chemicals to unleash tides of searing death.

### Ebon Dreadnaughts
Clad in sleek black steel, ebon dreadnoughts are suffused with entities of malice that draw strength from the shadows. Used as assassins by the elite of fel dwarf society, they mold umbral spears from surrounding darkness, piercing foes with weapons that leave no visible mark but inflict unspeakable misery. Once the deed is done, they melt back into the gloom from whence they came.

### Tormentor Dreadnaughts
Dreadnoughts with demons of death bound within are horrific indeed. These entities devise macabre weapons that keep their adversaries barely alive, preserving the faintest glimmer of life so they can be dragged back to the demon-smiths and enslaved—forced to live out their existence in endless agony.

<br>

\columnbreak

### Earthbane Dreadnaughts

The most terrible of demons are trapped within Hulking Dreadnoughts—massive horrors of sinister power. These brutes are equipped with hellish drills and claws, each capable of tearing through granite and sundering fortifications.

To add to their lethality, their enormous claw can unlatch from their armored frames, springing forward on thick chains. Should a claw strike a solid target, it clamps shut with crushing force and is swiftly reeled back toward the hulking warrior.

The drill is an even greater instrument of devastation. By piercing it into the ground, an earthbane dreadnought sends shockwaves rippling through the earth, causing it to scream and shatter. The ground erupts skyward in violent upheaval, crashing down in a cataclysmic wave that buries and batters any caught within.

> ***Siege Monster.*** The dreadnaught deals double damage to objects and structures.

> ***Tunneler.*** The dreadnaught can burrow through solid rock at half its burrowing speed and leaves a 5-foot-wide, 8-foot-high tunnel in its wake.
>
> ***Overdrive.*** When the dreadnaught fails a saving throw that required its action to make or fails a saving
throw at the beginning or end of a turn, it can choose to succeed instead. If it does so, it takes force damage equal to 3d10 plus the amount by which it failed the save.
>
> ***Weak Point.*** Whenever a creature has advantage on an attack roll against the dreadnaught, it can choose to roll only one die instead of two to aim for the dreadnaught's weak point. If the attack hits, the dreadnaught has vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from that attack. The attack still counts as having advantage for the purposes of other abilities, such as a rogue’s Sneak Attack.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The dreadnaught makes one Grip Claw attack or uses its Crushing Vise, then makes one Fel Drill attack. It can replace any of these attacks with a Swat .
>
> ***Swat.*** *Strength or Dexterity Saving Throw (target's choice):* DC 18, one target with in 10 feet 0f the dreadnaught.<Br>
> *Failure:* The target takes 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is pushed up to 30 feet in a straight line away from the Dreadnaught.  <br>
> *Failure by 10+:* The target also cannot stand until the end of its next turn unless it spends all its movement to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a success, it stands up.
>
> ***Grip Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is Grappled (escape DC 18) and pulled up to 30 feet straight toward the dreadnaught. Until this Grapple ends, the target is Restrained, and the dreadnaught can’t use Grip Claw on another target.
>
> ***Crushing Vise.*** *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 18, one creature Grappled by the dreadnaught. <br> 
> *Failure:* 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage, and the target becomes brittle until the end of its next turn. While brittle, any attack that hits the target is a critical hit. <br> 
> *Failure by 5+:* The target is also paralyzed until the end of its next turn.  <br>
> *Success:* Half damage only.
>
> ***Fel Drill.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d10 + 6) piercing damage, and the target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 18 (disadvantage if the attack was a critical hit). <br> 
> *Failure:* The dreadnaught automatically hits the target with another Fel Drill attack as part of this attack. The dreadnaught can only make one extra attack this way. <br> 
> *Failure by 5+:* The extra attack also deals an extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage on hit.
>
> ***Upheaval (3/Day).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 18, Each creature in a 20-foot-wide, 40-foot-high, 60-foot-long line on the ground originating from the dreadnaught.  
> *Failure:* 19 (3d12) bludgeoning damage, and the target is knocked Prone.  
> *Failure by 5+:* If the target is prone on earth or stone, it becomes buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature is Restrained, Blinded, has total cover, and is suffocating. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. This check has advantage if the creature making it has a burrow speed.  <br>
> *Success:* Half damage.  <br>
> *Success or Failure:* The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain if it is made of earth or stone.

### Fel Dwarf Dreadnaught Tactics

All dreadnoughts rely heavily on maintaining their Resolute Stance to prevent enemies from gaining advantage and striking their weak points.

#### Molten Dreadnought Tactics

Molten dreadnoughts seek to ignite as many targets as possible during combat. They use Naphtha Spray whenever they can hit two or more enemies (or other molten dreadnoughts) simultaneously. If no enemies are within melee range, they will also use Naphtha Spray to maintain the benefits of their Resolute Stance.

#### Ebon Dreadnought Tactics

Ebon dreadnoughts strike from the shadows, targeting creatures that are already in darkness while keeping their distance. If surrounded by melee attackers, they will use Shadow Step to reposition themselves and regain the advantage.

#### Tormentor Dreadnought Tactics

Tormentor dreadnoughts excel as defenders, aiming to minimize enemy movement and incoming damage. They open combat by using Torturous Containment against the creature with the lowest physical stats and the most health. They then employ Umbreal Binding on two different targets to further restrict enemy movement.

#### Earthbane Dreadnought Tactics

Earthbane dreadnoughts focus on isolating and crushing weaker ranged attackers. They use Grip Claw to pull low-Strength ranged enemies into melee, then immediately strike with their Fel Drill. If the target remains grappled on the dreadnought’s next turn, it uses Crushing Vise followed by another attack with the Fel Drill.

If the Dreadnought fails to grapple a target, or if it can hit three or more enemies at once, it uses Upheaval instead of Fel Drill.

The Dreadnought uses Swat to push away frontline warriors who obstruct its path to priority targets.

### Fel Dwarf Dreadnaught Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from fel dwarf dreadnaughts come from what can be salvaged from their chassis. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Metal item from a dreadnaught could be Dreadnaught Scrap, a 50gp version might be a Worn Dreadnaught Scrap, and a 200gp version could be a Masterwork Dreadnaught Scrap.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.



##### Normal Dreadnaught Materials: 10gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Gem|   Ruby (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2-4   | Metal | Dreadnaught Scrap (Worn/Masterwork)|

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The **Magic Theme** column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the **Example Descriptor** suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Fiendish magic item effects might drain the life of their victims or conjure unholy magic, while Shadow effects might create darkness or utilize necrotic magic. 

***Random Magic Ingredients.***
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Fel Dwarf Dreadnaught Magic Themes 
**Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot: 75%**
|1d4 | Magic Theme | Example Descriptor | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-2 <br>  | Fiendish| Demon-Touched| 
| 3-4 (Molten)  | Fire | Ever-Burning|  
| 3-4 (Ebon)  | Shadow  | Light-Devouring| 
| 3-4 (Tormentor)  | Fiendish  | Demon-Touched| 
| 3-4 (Earthbane)  | Earth  | Earthen| 

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

### New Condition: Resolute
The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
 * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
 * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
 * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
 
The condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.
 
### New Condition: Burning
The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished.
* **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
* **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
* **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

<br>

> ##### Notes on 2024 Burning Rules
> If you're using the rules for burning described in the 2024 edition of D&D, these are the changes that were made in this document:
> * **Sources of Burning Don't Stack.** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
> * **Damage At End of Turn.** Burning damage occurs at the end of a creature's turn rather than the beginning. This gives the creature the chance to try to end the condition before taking the damage, thus giving players more agency when they start burning.

## Bull Centaur Abominations
*Unholy Fusions of Dwarf, Bull, & Iron*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>

Many daemonsmiths devise their own twisted methods to create bull centaurs when their numbers are too few to serve the needs of their malevolent plots. Yet the most ambitious among the fel artificers are never satisfied. They continue to subject these creatures to horrific experiments in pursuit of greater power.

The rare few that survive such brutal trials are known as abominations. Their hides are fused with metal, etched with hellish runes, and the blood of countless unholy creatures courses through their veins. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Infernal spearguns replace their hands—used to impale any who draw near or to launch burning projectiles at distant foes. Their hooves strike with such fury that they shatter the earth and ignite the very air, leaving rubble and broken bodies scattered about them.

### Bull Centaur Abomination Tactics
The abomination uses Cataclysmic Slam as soon as it can hit two or more targets. It prioritizes using Infernal Skewer against enemies who are Paralyzed or Frightened.

### Bull Centaur Abomination Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from bull centaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

##### Bull Centaur Abomination Loot Table  (Avg. 1,250gp)


| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Items |
|  10-14 | 1d4(2) 500gp Items | 
|  15-21 | 1 1,000gp Items  |  
|  22-25 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items |  
|  26+ |  1 2,000gp Items |  

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 1,000gp Bone item from a bull centaur could be a Abominable Centaur Horn, a 500gp version might be a Damaged Abominable Centaur Horn, and a 2,000gp version could be an Enhanced Abominable Centaur Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Bull Centaur Abomination Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Abominable Centaur Horn (Damaged/Enhanced) | 
| 2   | Jewelry | Fire Opal (Damaged/Flawless)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Abominable Centaur Plating (Damaged/Masterwork) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of bull centaurs, Fiendish effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that steal the lives of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.

## Siege Giants
*Tormented Behemoths Wielding Grafted Weaponry*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Underdark,  Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>
Few creatures are as legendary for their tumultuous and unruly nature as giants. Their immense size and strength allow them to indulge in reckless behavior without fear of repercussions. A giant lives only to roam, driven by the endless need for vast quantities of food to sate its voracious appetite and enough barrels of ale and mead to overcome its resilient fortitude. As they pursue their gluttonous desires, they leave behind broken landscapes and ruined villages.

The empires of the fel dwarves have witnessed these living weapons and sought to bend such power to their will, as is the nature of the fel dwarf. Many giants have been captured by the infernal enclaves, either through cunning trickery or overwhelming military force. These captives are dragged to massive foundries, where they undergo a torturous transformation. Dense metal plates studded with thick, protruding spikes are grafted onto the giant’s leathery skin. The brute’s meaty hands are torn off and replaced with enormous weapons—hooked blades capable of tearing down castle walls and pickaxes the size of oxen. These tortured engines of war are known as Siege Giants.

When battle looms, the towering iron behemoths stumble forth to carry out their master's cruel bidding. Their tormented minds and heavy grafted metal exteriors make them unpredictable and hazardous, wildly swinging their colossal weapons and pulverizing foundations wherever their rampage takes them. The brutal momentum of their iron-clad legs crushes stone as they stomp across the battlefield, oblivious to friend or foe.

### Siege Giant Tactics
Siege giants are dim-witted, tormented creatures that instinctively lumber toward the largest enemy or the source of their pain, attempting to destroy it if left without guidance.

However, when controlled by their fel dwarf masters, they are directed to unleash their area-of-effect attacks on clusters of enemies while reserving their single-target strikes for foes with weak saving throws against the attack's secondary effects.


\columnbreak

### Siege Giant Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from siege giants are the remains of the equipment that was grafted onto them. These items could be found or identified using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks, or they could be harvested from the giant's armaments using an Intelligence (Blacksmith's Tools) check.


Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

|  20-24 | 1d4(2) 2,000gp Items |  
|  25+ |  2d4(5) 2,000gp Items |  

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 1,000gp Metal item from a siege giant could be Siege Giant Plating, a 500gp version might be Damaged Siege Giant Plating, and a 2,000gp version could be a Masterwork Siege Giant Plating.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Siege Giant Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Blood|   Siege Giant Blood (Clotted/Pure) | 
| 2   | Bone | Monstrous Bone Fragment (Damaged/Pristine)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Siege Giant Plating (Damaged/Masterwork) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of siege giants, Fiendish effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that steal the lives of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.****

## Shah'tar, The Grand Executioner
*Most Dreaded of All Bull Centaurs*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>
In a desolate land where ash lies thick upon the ground, and clouds of black smoke conceal the earth from the idle gaze of the heavens, there winds a river of broken peoples—gathered from many lands, chained one to another like pebbles heaped by the will of crueler hands. At their flanks strode the dwarfs, grim and gleeful, whose whips cracked like thunder, driving the wretched forward without word or mercy.

Through dust-choked vistas they marched, mile upon mournful mile, until from the haze arose a temple—tall and black, and sudden as a robber springing from shadow.

Its gates, wrought of iron and rimmed with carvings of winged beasts most foul, yawned wide like the mouth of some ravenous demon, eager to devour the throng that marched toward it. Within, the slaves beheld vast halls, their walls of obsidian lit only by ancient runes that burned—not with fire, but with the hate of the hands that carved them. And in that place there rose a statue, hewn from ebon marble, in the image of a dark and hateful god. Its gaze fell ever downward, filled with scorn for those who crawled at its feet.

There, upon a brass altar beneath that blasphemous effigy, stood a creature made in the likeness of the god that loomed above. Its lower half was that of a mighty bull, shod in hooves like charred stumps of trees, and its hide gleamed like beaten steel. From the waist upward it was a dwarf, though of hue ashen and lifeless, and over its face hung a mask of braided chains, through which gleamed the souls of demons, ever whispering of sin. In its gnarled hands it bore an axe of dreadful beauty, forged of gold and red iron, and faintly the spirits of slaughter could be heard chanting a chorus in praise of the ruin it had wrought.

And those who had come thus far beheld this vision, and terror took them. What little hope had lingered fled from their hearts, and they became still—for no lashing of whips could drive them onward, not to that forsaken god nor to his monstrous servant. But the demons in chains awakened. The scent of fear hung thick in the air, and from the mask they curled forth like serpents of smoke, winding about the slaves and rending flesh and spirit alike, seeking anguish to feast upon before the end.

Then the slaves fell to their knees, and the great beast came near. It raised its axe, and the spirits of slaughter howled. The temple floor shook with the laughter of its hateful god.

Thither go all the rivers of slaves that wander the desolate land, and the end of every river is the same—a sea of blood upon the black temple’s floor.

And upon that sea drift severed heads, their eyes wide with dread, still gazing upward at the monster who had made such a sea, who yet stood unmoving. For he who is forged to wield the blade of death is Shah'tar, The Grand Executioner of the dark god—and his labor shall not cease.


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br>

### Shah'tar's Lair
Shah'tar makes his lair within a great temple of the dark god he serves.

When fighting within his lair, Shah'tar's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 2.

#### Sacrificial Circle
When Shah'tar rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or Shah'tar dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 14 and can act of its own accord, always acting in the best interest of Shah'tar. While active in this way, the lair is aware of the location of all creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair creates a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of hellish energy centered on a point on the ground within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 of the next turn. It causes the following effects:

* A creature in the lair that is outside of the cylinder and attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 19.<br>
*Failure:* The spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn’t expended.<br>
*Success:* The creature casts the spell as normal.
* A creature inside the cylinder that casts a spell of 1st level or higher takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage per level of the spell. This damage can't be reduced in anyway.
* A creature other than Shah'tar in the lair that is outside of the cylinder subtracts 1d6 from all its damage rolls.
* Whenever a creature other than Shah'tar ends its turn in the cylinder, it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.


#### Regional Effects
The area where Shah'tar dwells is corrupted by his presence, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of his lair:

* Whenever a creature hits with an attack that rolls a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 damage.
* Whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw, demonic spirits appear and Restrain it until they are destroyed (AC 15; HP 20; immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, Fire, Necrotic, and Poison damage). While Restrained, the creature can't teleport and can't cast spells other than cantrips.
* Any attack that hits creature with 0 hitpoints is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

These effects gradually dissipate over 1d10 days after Shah'tar's death.

### Epic Battle: The Mass Executioner
If you wish to make Shah'tar into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 588 hit points, and give him the Mass Execution trait, described below; this increases his CR to 21.

***Mass Execution (Recharges after a short or long rest).*** If Shah'tar becomes Boodied (294 HP), his Marked for Death trait is immediately triggered, targeting any number of creatures within 90 feet of him. He then replaces his Death Toll action with Massacre, described below.

***Massacre. (Initiative Count 1).*** Shah'tar can move up to 50 feet. During the movement, he may either make one Hamstringing Greataxe or three Execute attacks; each attack must be against a different target.
 
### Shah'tar Tactics
Shah'tar's primary goal in combat is to use his Execution attack to finish off weakened foes.

#### Marked for Death 

Shah'tar designates a preferred target for execution based on one or more of the following factors:

* **Restrained or Prone:** The target is already restrained and/or prone.
* **Reachability:** Shah'tar favors targets he can reach in a straight line, enabling use of his Resolute Charge action.
* **Low Armor Class:** If multiple valid targets are available, he prioritizes the one with the lowest AC, especially if it's Restrained.

#### Normal Turn
On a typical turn, Shah'tar prepares his prey using a combination of:
1. Dazing Gore to knock the target prone
2. Pinning Stomp to restrain them
3. and if the target is already restrained, a combination of Dazing Gore followed by Execution.


#### Proclamation of Doom
This ability targets creatures that are either Marked for Death or have low Charisma saving throws.


#### Death Toll
Shah'tar always attempts an Execution attack if a target is eligible. If no valid execution targets are available, he instead uses his Hamstringing Greataxe to attack a Prone target, if possible.


#### Sacrificial Circle
The Sacrificial Circle cylinder is placed over the largest cluster of Restrained or Prone creatures within range.

### Bull Centaur Executioners
Within the iron temples of the fel dwarves, countless sacrifices are made to appease their avaricious gods. At the heart of the grandest of these macabre rituals stands the hulking figure of a bull centaur executioner. These beasts wear black chain veils over their faces and wield ornately carved axes forged from unholy volcanic rock.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

With deadly precision, they pin down struggling victims beneath their hooves and, with a single decisive swing, separate head from neck. Their strikes are so exact and powerful that even full-grown ogres have been cleanly decapitated in this manner.

#### Bull Centaur Executioner Tactics
Executioners mark creatures with low Strength scores and will relentlessly focus on executing that target for the remainder of the combat.

### Bull Centaur Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from bull centaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

##### Shah'tar, The Executioner Loot Table <br> (Avg. 2,550gp)


| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Item |

|  26+ |  1d6(3) 2,000gp Items |  

### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Bone item from a bull centaur could be a Bull Centaur Horn, a 5gp version might be a Young Bull Centaur Horn, and a 20gp version could be an Elite Bull Centaur Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Bull Centaur Materials: 10gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Bull Centaur Horn (Young/Elite) | 
| 2   | Jewelry | Obsidian Insigina (Initiate's/Elite)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Bull Centaur Armor Plate (Inferior/Masterwork) |  

\columnbreak

##### Shah'tar Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Executioner's Horn (Damaged/Pristine) | 
| 2   | Jewelry | Executioner's Emblem (Lesser/Greater)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Executioner's Armament (Damaged/Pristine) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of bull centaurs, Fiendish effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that steal the lives of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.
