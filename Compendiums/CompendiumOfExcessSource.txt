# Demonic Compendium of Excess
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness, but none are so tempting as the demons of excess.  These demons are born from the mortal desire to overindulge in life's earthly pleasures.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to tempt and corrupt humanoids.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of excess and obsession.   

***Mortal Followers.*** In addition to demons, the forces of excess include hedonistic mortals willing to achieve their debased desires by any means necessary. They are blessed with unearthly grace and charisma, allowing them to charm and manipulate those unfortunate enough to catch their attention. Those affected this way can range from narcissistic humanoids to monstrous creatures of the mortal realm afflicted by demonic exposure, which become cruel and beguiling versions of their former selves.

***Hedonistic Allure.*** Unlike other demons, these fiends often present themselves as friendly to mortals, offering to aid them in achieving whatever gratification they desire.  Wherever they go, these fiends seek to drive mortals to self-destructive levels of debauchery.  

\columnbreak


If time and circumstance allow, this corruption can be done subtly as the demons work their influence across one or more individuals, slowly driving their victims to commit more and more depraved acts.  Over time, the victim's ability to delay any form of gratification wanes away, leaving behind a self-indulgent hedonist. In combat, these demons can unleash their supernatural allure in a much less subtle way to temporarily impair and charm their enemies.  The fiends will use this tactic to reduce the number of combatants they face while swiftly dispatching any who resist their charms.  

***Ecstasy In Pain*** While demons of excess prefer to undo their victims using their tempting charms, they are more than capable of dismembering their enemies.  When the situation calls, these fiends can move with incredible speed, closing the distance between themselves and a foe in the blink of an eye.  Their attacks are made with equal speed, and their agility makes them difficult to strike.  Regardless of how quickly they move, their motions are always made with sensual grace.

Even when excess demons resort to direct violence, their attacks are laced with perverse pleasure.  These demons blur pleasure and pain and their victims often moan with ecstatic agony even as they are ripped limb from limb.  Each of these demons' movements is made with erotic grace, and they relish every bit of pain they can inflict.  They even appear to take masochistic pleasure in their own pain, and will squeal in ecstasy as they are slain.

# Running Demonic Excess Adventures
Demons of excess represent the unfiltered desires of mortals and their insatiable craving for increasingly intense experiences. They are attracted to people and places filled with debased cravings and draw power from mortals who selfishly act upon their urges with little thought to the consequences, thus allowing decadence, hedonism, and cruelty to spiral out of control. Mortals bored and dissatisfied with life may pact with these demons for unimaginable pleasures, enhanced beauty, and charisma. However, such pleasures inevitably lead to equal pain, spiraling mortals into cruelty, depravity, and ultimately the loss of their souls in pursuit of ever-greater highs.

Players are most likely to encounter these demons when they've been summoned by such mortals. But demons of excess may also spawn in locations rife with debauched hedonistic behavior. Backalley brothels & drug dens, towns caught up in drunken revelries, and the estates of depraved and decadent nobles are all places where demons of excess can manifest and begin driving mortals to even greater levels of cruel hedonism.

Mortal followers of excess or creatures seduced by its demonic influence have fewer hindrances navigating the Material Plane and can appear in almost any location. However, the longer they linger in an area and spread the beguiling influence of excess, the more likely that actual demons of excess will begin to spawn.

### Forces of Excess Motivations
Demons of excess and creatures twisted by their influence are both enchantingly alluring and disturbingly offensive to behold, which reflects the charming charisma and narcissistic cruelty they harbor. They see the world and everyone in it as playthings meant to help them achieve their desires. Their demonic gifts are all designed to aid in the pursuit of these desires, and they take twisted pleasure in utilizing these gifts to toy with and torment victims at their leisure, only ending the twisted game with a cruel finale when they begin to grow bored.

All creatures of excess seek personal gratification above all else. The more simple-minded among them behave like addicts, single-mindedly chasing their next high. More sophisticated creatures of excess may pursue more nuanced pleasures, such as artistic perfection or the inflation of their own egos, and are capable of subtle and complex forms of manipulation. They excel at identifying the hidden desires of others and will exploit these weaknesses to tempt and manipulate their victims. But, regardless of their subtleties or capabilities, all creatures of excess only take actions that are in service of their selfish desires.

The most crucial aspect of roleplaying a creature of excess is understanding what hedonistic desire it is currently pursuing. The nature of this desire and how it is achieved vary from creature to creature, but for many, the means are as important as the ends. Seeing mortals succumb to corruption is almost always more satisfying than outright slaying them. Creatures of excess enjoy beguiling their foes and will often torment them rather than go for the quick kill.

\columnbreak

When roleplaying powerful creatures of excess, it can be helpful to understand what the motivations of your players and their characters are so they can be more effectively tempted. Player characters could be offered wealth, power boosts, or greater social status depending on their motivations, and these sorts of temptations can emphasize the allure and dangers of creatures of excess.

#### Common Creature of Excess Motivations
* Pursuit of hedonistic experiences
* Tormenting or corrupting other creatures
* Physical or artistic perfection
* Gaining the favor of an even more powerful & charismatic creature of excess

### Creature of Excess Tactics
These creatures share many similar characteristics that lead to certain fighting styles. 

***High Speed & Evasion.*** The forces of excess have high move speeds and evasiveness, helping them to dodge attacks while performing hit-and-run attacks. They are difficult to catch and even more difficult to escape.

***Crowd Control.*** Creatures of excess often inflict status effects on their foes that hamper their combat abilities or, worse, turn them against their allies. They excel at targeting foes based on their weakness and disrupting players' functionality as a team.

***Fragile Melee Fighters.*** Creatures of excess generally can't take many direct hits, despite usually being melee fighters. They rely on evasion, hit-and-run tactics, and crowd control effects to stay alive long enough to win the fight.

#### Engagement

Demons of excess try to open fights by inflicting as many status effects on their foes as possible. They then use their speed to close the distance on their debilitated prey.

#### Combat
Creatures of excess are often fragile melee fighters who engage in prolonged fights, meaning they need to rely on evasion and crowd control effects to keep from taking hits. They prioritize keeping their most dangerous foes debilitated while they weave through combat, picking off soft targets. Their most dangerous foes are those who can deal high burst damage or pin them down with crowd control effects.



#### Retreat
The forces of excess will use retreat as a means of drawing their foes into vulnerable positions when a fight isn't going their way. They are difficult to catch, and creatures of excess enjoy playing cat-and-mouse games with their enemies, letting them believe they are routing their foes, only to unexpectedly deliver a speedy counterattack. Sometimes creatures of excess will make a "true" retreat, but it is almost always to return and strike at their foes when they least suspect it. These retreats may be to avoid defeat or because they s would rather leave their victims alive to torment later.

# Player Options

## Primal Path

### Path of the Demon Soul
Barbarians who follow this accursed path discover a demonic presence within themselves, yearning for release. This presence may be the result of a demonic curse, overexposure to Abyssal magics, or even demonic possession. In any case, when these barbarians lose control, their fiendish nature manifests itself visibly, warping their appearance and allowing them to unleash an unholy fury upon their foes.


#### Demonic Surges
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
The dark powers coursing through you give you access to demonic abilities in the form of Demonic Surges. Demonic Surges are supernatural abilities that momentarily boost your combat abilities or create fiendish spell-like effects. You use your Strength modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Demonic Surge and when making an attack roll with one. If you are raging, you may add your rage damage to any one damage roll made as a result of a Demonic Surge. Using a Demonic Surge also counts as making an attack that round for the purposes of maintaining your rage.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

<div align="center"> 

**Surge save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

**Surge attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

</div>

**Surge Slots.** The Demonic Surges table shows how many surge slots you have to use Demonic Surges of 1st level and higher. To use one of these surges, you must expend a slot of the surge's level or higher. You regain all expended Surge Slots when you complete a long rest.

**Surges Known of 1st-Level and Higher.** You know three 1st-level Demonic Surges of your choice from the list Demonic Surges section, which starts on the next page.

The Surges Known column of the Demon Soul Surges table shows when you learn more Demonic Surges of 1st level or higher.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the surges you know with another surge of your choice. This surge must be of a level for which you have surge slots.

#### Fiendish Resilience 
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
Your demonic nature grants you increased resistance to elemental forces. You now have resistance to lightning, fire, and cold damage while raging.

#### Reckless Surge
*6th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>

You may apply your Reckless Attack feature to any attacks you make as part of your Demonic Surges. Additionally, when you use a Demonic Surge that requires creatures to make a saving throw, you may choose to force all affected creatures to make their saving throw with disadvantage. If you do, all attack rolls against you have advantage and all saving throws you make have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.


#### Brutal Surge
*10th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
You may apply your Brutal Critical feature to any attacks you make with your Demonic Surges. Additionally, when you use your Reckless Surge or Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to have your Demonic Surges ignore all resistances and treat all immunity as though it is resistance until the start of your next turn. Doing so causes you to lose all resistances granted by your rage until the start of your next turn.


#### Chaos Conduit
*14th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
While raging, you may use a 1st level demonic surge without expending a Surge Slot. You can use this ability only once per rage.

#### Demonic Surges
The surges are grouped by surge level and listed alphabetically. 

##### 1st Level Surges
&emsp;**Abyssal Skulk.**  As an action, you magically turn invisible. The invisibility lasts for 1 minute or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force a creature to make a saving throw.

**Arrogant Rage.** When you enter a rage or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage such that you gain a surge of reckless confidence, allowing you to demoralize any who would dare strike you. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



While raging this way, whenever a creature makes an attack against you and would have advantage as a result of your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge features, you can use your reaction to demoralize that creature, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it loses the advantage your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge granted it and instead suffers disadvantage on the attack.
 
Creatures immune to being charmed and frightened automatically pass this save.

This surge ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.



**Burning Whip.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to summon a burning whip in a free hand that you can use to immediately make a single melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 3d6 fire damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward you. 

The whip disappears immediately after you make this attack.

**Defile Earth.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to cause the ground within 10 feet of you to become polluted with demonic ichor. The area is corrupted for the next minute, during which time it is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. 

As an action, you can cause any number of 5-foot-by-5-foot square areas covered in this ichor to burst with demonic rot, which clears that area of the ichor. Any creature standing in the burst must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**Demonic Appendages.** As a bonus action, choose a damage type from piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. You cause your hands to mutate into demonic appendages (such as claws, tentacles, or skewers) for the next hour or until you dismiss this surge as a bonus action. The appendages can be used as weapons while not holding anything and count as simple melee weapons with the Light property that add your Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls when you attack with them. They each deal 1d10 of the chosen damage type on it.

**Fiendish Horns.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to grow large demonic horns and use them to make a single melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 3d8 piercing damage, and if the target is a creature and you moved at least 20 ft. before making the attack, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone, and you may push it up to 10 feet away from you.

The horns disappear immediately after making this attack.


**Flames of Chaos.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to hurl a bolt of iridescent fire at a creature within 100 feet of you as a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 fire damage and becomes engulfed in chaotic flames until the end of your next turn. 

If the creature takes damage from one of your Demonic Surges while covered in these flames,  the flames disappear, and that surge deals an additional 1d12 damage as it draws energy from the fires.

**Foul Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 2d6 poison damage. The target must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

**Fresh Meat.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to feast on the corpse of one Small or larger creature within 5 feet of you that died within the last minute, causing you to regain a number of hit points equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier.

**Hateful Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by focusing it into a hatred for another creature you can see within 90 feet of you. For the duration of this effect, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to that creature whenever you hit it with an attack. 

This surge ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

\columnbreak

**Hungering Jaws.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to attempt to bite a creature within 5 feet of you with razor-sharp jaws as a melee spell attack. On a hit, you deal 2d8 piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, you regain a number of hit points equal to the damage it dealt.

**Hypnotic Summons.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to whisper maddening words to one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you, twisting its mind and drawing it toward you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as close as its speed allows toward you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move toward you. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

**Lightning Blade.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to create a blade of chaotic lighting in a free hand that you can use to immediately make a single melee spell attack. This attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 18 or higher. On a hit, it deals 2d12 lightning damage. The blade disappears immediately after making this attack.

**Nightmare Rage.** When you enter a rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can enhance your rage by filling your mind with nightmarish visions that you can inflict upon others. While raging this way, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack or an attack from one of your Demonic Surges, you may surround the target with nightmarish visions for the next minute or until you surround another creature with visions. 

If the target willingly moves 5 feet before the visions end, it must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success, and the visions affecting it end.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge beyond what this ability allows you to maintain.

**Savage Rush.**  As a bonus action, you draw upon an unholy vigor, allowing you to move up to your movement speed horizontally in a straight line. The first creature you run into during this movement must succeed on a Strength saving or be pushed ahead of you for the rest of the movement. If the creature succeeds on the save, or you run into a second creature, your movement stops.

##### 2nd Level Surges

**Burning Smite.**  When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 3d10 fire damage.

**Cruel Revival.** As a bonus action, you speak a dark incantation which awakens the corpse of a Small or Medium creature you can see within 30 feet of you that died within the last 10 minutes. The corpse immediately stands up and becomes a **zombie** (the statistics for zombies can be found in the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your Strength ability modifier. In combat, the zombie shares your initiative count.

While the zombie is within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to mentally command it to do your bidding. If it receives no such commands, it takes no actions and does not move. 

The zombie crumbles to dust after 10 minutes.

**Demonic Eyes.** As an action, you cause your eyes to take on demonic traits and appearance. For the next 8 hours, you gain darkvision out to 120 and areas of dim light are not considered lightly obscured to you.

**Horror Nimbus.** As an action, you magically emit scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of that you that can see the light must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.


**Indestructible Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a <br> bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage to <br> make yourself nearly indestructible. While this effect <br> lasts, you have an advantage on Constitution checks <br> and saving throws and resistance to all damage <br> except radiant damage.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute <br> passes, or you enhance your rage with another <br> Demonic Surge.

**Inflicted Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a <br> bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage <br> by attempting to psychically inflict another creature <br> within 120 feet of you with it. That creature must <br> succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be <br> subjected to this rage for one minute, until your <br> rage ends, or until you enhance your rage with <br> another surge.

\columnbreak

While under the effects of this rage, the creature can only use its action to make weapon attacks or take the Dash action, and it can no longer cast or maintain concentration on spells.

The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Inhuman Grace.**  As a bonus action, you endow yourself with such unnatural grace that any you stride past have their minds rent by the sight of your movements. Until the end of your turn, whenever you move 5 feet away from a creature that can see you, it takes 2d8 psychic damage. A creature can only take this damage once per turn. 

If you used your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge features this turn, your speed also increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn.


**Insanity Gaze.**  As an action, you turn your madding gaze upon a creature you can see within 90 feet of you, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must use its movement on its next turn to move within 5 feet of a creature of your choice and then use its action to make a melee attack against that creature. If it is unable to reach the chosen creature, it does not use its action that turn.

**Malevolent Flame.** As an action, you create an area of flame that fills a 5-foot cube in front of you and move it out 30 ft. away from you, where it remains until the end of your next turn, at which point the flame moves toward your current location. The flame disappears after reaching you or moving 30 ft. toward you.

Whenever the flame moves into the space of a creature other than you, or a creature other than you ends its turn standing in the flame, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage, and on a pass, it takes half as much.

The flame ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Torturous Claws.** As an action, two razor-sharp clawed limbs grow from you and strike at nearby foes. Make two melee spells attacks against targets within 5 feet of you. On a hit, a target takes 2d10 slashing damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn as it is racked with pain.

If both attacks made this way hit the same target, it is afflicted with even more intense pain, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. It takes an additional 3d10 psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. 

The limbs disappear immediately after you make the attacks with them.

**Unholy Stench.** As an action, you cause a foul smell to emanate out to a 10-foot radius around yourself. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of your next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.


**Spew Bile.** As an action, you spew forth a stream of corrosive bile. Each creature in a 15-foot cone in front of you takes 4d4 acid damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is covered in acid, causing it to take another 4d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn unless a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off of it beforehand. On a successful save, a creature is not covered in acid and takes no additional damage at the end of its next turn.



**Rampaging Rage.**  When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage with an insatiable bloodlust. While under this effect, up to once on each of your turns, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack or a Demonic Surge, you gain an additional action. This action can only be used to take a Dash action or an Attack action to make one weapon attack.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

##### 3rd Level Surges

**Cackling Flail.** As an action, you choose a point you can see within 15 feet of you and conjure a three-headed demonic flail made of cackling skulls in a free hand which you use to make three melee spell attacks against up to three different creatures who are within 15 feet of the chosen point. On a hit, an attack from this flail deals 3d8 thunder damage. 

If one or more of the creatures hit by the flail is reduced to 0 hit points, you may immediately make another attack with it against each of the remaining targets who still have 1 or more hit points. If this second set of attacks reduces another creature to 0 hit points, you may repeat the process.

Once you can no longer make any attacks, the flail disappears.

**Contaminating Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage to channel it into a stream of demonic corruption that oozes into a 15-foot radius area centered on yourself. This area moves with you, and you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. 

When a creature you haven’t designated enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage, and its speed is halved while it remains in the area. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and its speed isn’t reduced.

The contaminated area disappears if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Dark Flight.** As an action, you cause wings to spring from your back granting you flying speed of 60 feet for the next 10 minutes. If the effect ends while you are in the air, you immediately begin falling unless some other effect prevents this.

\pagebreakNum

**Devour.** As an action, your jaw unhinges, and you attempt to magically swallow a Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of you that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by you. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside you, and it takes 3d4 acid damage at the start of each of your turns. 

The creature is swallowed until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell, except it can be maintained while raging). If you lose concentration, the swallowed creature is regurgitated and falls prone into a space of your choice within 5 feet of you.

**Ecstatic Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 4d8 psychic damage to it as you subject it to overwhelming bliss. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn.

**Eldritch Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by allowing maddening demonic knowledge to flood your mind. For the duration of this effect, you have advantage on all Intelligence checks and saving throws. Additionally, once per turn, you may use a 1st level Demonic Surge that replaces one of your attacks without expending a surge slot. 

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Fire Stomp.** As an action, you slam the ground, causing fire to erupt out from you to a 15-foot radius. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 fire damage. On a pass, it takes half as much damage.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Lightning Lance.** As an action, you launch a bolt of lightning in a 60-foot long 10-foot wide line. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Manic Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you channel your rage to the point of manic insanity, turning yourself into a whirlwind of death. While in this state, if you make an attack that would have advantage as a result of your Reckless Attack feature, you can forgo that advantage to make the same attack against another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within the attack’s range. These extra attacks can’t benefit from advantage from any source or be replaced with Demonic Surges. 

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Undying Evil.**  You gain the demonic ability to escape death. As an action, you place a ward on yourself that lasts for 8 hours or until you use this surge again. If you die while under the effects of the ward, your body dissolves into foul ichor, leaving behind only the equipment you were wearing or carrying. 

After 1 minute, you reform in the unoccupied space closest to the location where you died. Your soul must be both willing and able to reform, and you can’t return to life if you died of old age. 

When you reform, you return to life with 1 hit point and the ward ends.


**Warp Flesh.** As an action, you target a creature you can see within 5 feet of you and warp its body with chaotic magics. It must make a Charisma saving throw or become brittle until the end of your next turn. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

**Warp Jump.** As an action, you teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 100 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Before or after teleporting, you can make one attack as part of this action.


##### 4th Level Surges

**Bellow of Endless Fury.** As an action, you unleash a roar of fiery rage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Chaotic Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 4d10 force damage as you channel raw chaos through it. 

Additionally, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or suffer one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below until the end of your next turn.


##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight. At the end of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|

**Limb Storm** As an action, you briefly grow extra sets of demonic limbs which strike out at nearby creatures. You may make up to six melee spell attacks with these limbs as part of this action, which each deal 1d12 piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage (your choice) on hit. 

The limbs disappear immediately after you make the attacks with them.

**Oozing Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage, causing you to grow wobbling mounds of slime and flesh, which seal your wounds as you receive them. For the duration of this effect, you gain a +10 to the Constitution saving throw you make as part of your Relentless Rage feature, and you regain 1d6 hit points at the start of each of your turns.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Shared Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you can enhance your rage to inspire it in another willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature gains the following benefits until your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge:

* It has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

* When it makes its first attack on each of its turns, it can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives it advantage on melee weapon attacks, but attack rolls against it have advantage until its next turn.
* If the creature is able to cast spells, it can't cast them or concentrate on them.



**Sentient Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by focusing it into an entirely separate consciousness, which may even form itself into a new head that grows from your body. When you do so, you may choose two Demonic Surges you know that both enhance your rage and have a combined level of 4 or less. You gain the effects of both those surges until your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Soul Rend.** Your chest cracks open and projects a vortex of life-draining energy out to 30 feet from you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature that is Small or larger and dropped to 0 hit points by this effect dies, causing you to regain hit points equal to the number of hit dice it had.

**Stunning Screech.** As an action, you emit a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of you that can hear it must succeed on a DC Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. 

**Summon Demon.** You utter foul abyssal words, calling a demon forth from the chaos of the Abyss. Choose a demon of CR 5 or lower such as a **shadow demon** or a **barlgura**. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 hour has passed.

The demon obeys your commands, and in combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one that is listed in its stat block or any other action that the demon would be capable of.

### Demons Soul Barbarian Archetypes
If you have a specific type of demon or demon lord you want your barbarian to emulate the powers of, you can choose Demonic Surges that thematically fit with that demon. The following Demonic Surge lists are grouped based on common demonic themes and demon lords, though you may need to change how you describe of some of the surges to better fit the powers associated with your theme. 

Note that some surges like *demonic appendages*, *demonic eyes*, *undying evil*, and *summon demon* are so general that they can thematically fit with almost any type of demon.

### Demon Soul Adventurers
Below are some options that can be used as inspiration for your barbarian’s backstory and the origin of their powers. 

| d12  | Demon Soul Origin |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | You underwent a dark ritual in exchange for the power needed to achieve your goals |
|  2  | You hail from a demon worshiping barbarian tribe.  You've abandoned the tribe and their evil ways, but you still wield the dark forces they bestowed upon you. |
|  3  | A gateway to the Abyss opened near your home town.  You survived the ordeal, but were forever changed by its demonic energies.
|  4  | You were the subject of dark and bizarre arcane experiments.  |
|  5  | All you remember were fiends attacking your town.  Now, when you're in danger, you black out.  When you come to, you're surrounded by bodies and left with only brief flashes of what happened. |
|  6  | You took it upon yourself to trap the soul of a demon within yourself, thereby preventing it from returning to the Abyss and reforming.  |
|  7  | You were subjected to a fiendish curse which you struggle to keep from consuming your soul. |
|  8  | You have fiendish parentage, which you learned about when you came of age and your fiendish traits began manifesting. |
|  9  | You've attracted the attention of a demon lord who is bestowing its "gifts" upon you in hopes of corrupting your soul.
| 10  | You were once a demon, but sought to escape the Abyss and find redemption by reincarnating yourself as a mortal.  
| 11  | You are dedicated to fighting demons by using their own powers against them, and you've turned yourself into an unrelenting slayer who brings doom to any fiend you find. 
| 12  | Your powers aren't fiendish in nature, but have some other planar origin, such as Limbo, the Far Realm, or the Elemental Plane of Fire.

## Demon Soul Barbarian NPCs
The following stat blocks can be used to describe non-player characters who are demon soul barbarians or warriors with similar powers. You can choose the stat block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC and apply the Demonic Surges of your choice that best fit the desired theme of the NPC, as described in its Demonic Surges feature. You may also opt to provide your NPCs with fewer known surges than the stat block suggests so as to keep its combat options simpler and make it easier for players to learn its attack patterns.

To further customize your NPC, apply the racial traits of whichever humanoid race you’ve chosen for it.

> ##### Demon Barbarian Building Tips
> &#8226; Don’t add more different types of surges than you need to reach the design goal of your barbarian
> <br> &#8226; Only having one surge that enhances the barbarian’s rage makes it a lot easier to manage.
> <br> &#8226; Changing out weapons & skills or modifying mental stats are a simple ways to help differentiate the look and style of your barbarians.
<br> &#8226; If you give a barbarian the *eldritch rage* surge, it needs to know a surge that can be used in place of an attack, and it's best to allow it to use that surge as a bonus action while raging. Otherwise, it will rarely get the same resource-saving benefits as a player from the ability.

## Demon Soul Barbarian Examples
The following is a list of example stat blocks made using the demon soul barbarian templates. The barbarian examples don’t always know as many surges as their template stat block suggests.  Rather than using surge slots, the different demonic surge abilities each have a certain number of uses. Other modifications include tweaking non-combat stats, swapping out weapons, or replacing the rage feature with the one enhanced by a known demonic surge. All these changes are made to enhance the theme of the barbarian and streamline its stat block for readability.

> ### Bonus Actions 
>

>
> *  It has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
> *  It deals an extra 2 damage with its melee weapon attacks.
> *  It has resistance to cold, fire, lightning, bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
>
> The rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if the barbarian is incapacitated or if its turn ends and it hasn't attacked a hostile creature, forced a hostile creature to make a saving throw, or taken damage since its last turn.
>
> ***Inhuman Grace (1/day).***  The barbarian endows itself with such unnatural grace that any it strides past have their minds rent by the sight of its movements. Until the end of its turn, whenever it moves 5 feet away from a creature that can see it, that creature takes 2d8 psychic damage. A creature can only take this damage once per turn. 
>
> If the barbarian used its Reckless Attack feature this turn, its speed also increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The barbarian makes two attacks. It can use Hypnotic Summons in place any of the attacks.
>
> ***Glaive.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Hypnotic Summons. (2/day).*** The barbarian whispers maddening words to one creature of its choice within 60 feet of it that can hear it, twisting the creature's mind and drawing it toward the barbarian. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 10 (3d6) psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as close as its speed allows toward the barbarian. The creature doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn't have to move toward the barbarian. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Demoralize.*** If the barbarian is raging and has used its Reckless feature since the start of its last turn, in response to a creature making an attack against it, it attempts to demoralize that creature, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the attacking creature loses the advantage it gained from the barbarian using its Reckless feature and instead suffers disadvantage on the attack. 
Creatures immune to being charmed and frightened automatically pass this save.

## Lore of Excess
Spellcasters wielding magic of excess <br> favor spells that induce indulgence, pain, <br> pleasure, some perverse combination of <br> all three. While many existing D&D spells <br> can represent this magic, the following <br> new spells provide even more ways of <br> bringing this profane style of sorcery into <br> your campaigns.


#### Acquiescence
*2rd-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** range 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of fine sand, <br>rose petals, or a cricket)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

Choose one creature you can see within range. The <br> target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or <br> become Drowsy* for the duration. At the end of each <br> of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, <br> ending the effect on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. 

#### Cacophonic Call
*7th-level Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:**   1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You unleash an ululating scream that radiates from you in a 30-foot radius. The scream can be heard up to 1,000 feet away. Each creature of your choice in the area must make a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (its choice).

**Successful Constitution Save.** The creature takes 4d8 Psychic damage and is Frightened of you until the start of your next turn. While Frightened in this way, it can only cast spells of 1st level or lower.

**Successful Wisdom Save.** The creature takes 4d8 Thunder damage and is Dazed* until the start of your next turn.

**Failed Save (Either Type).** The creature suffers both of the above effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the thunder and Psychic damage is increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.

<br>

**New condition described at end of section*

#### Chaotic Pavane
*3rd-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:**  30 feet
- **Components:** V S M (a bit of catgut)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

Each creature in a 15-foot cube centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected for the duration.

On a failed save, the creature begins a painful, involuntary dance. While dancing, the creature:

* Can't take reactions or bonus actions.
* Must stand up if Prone, spending 5 feet of movement to do so.
* Must take the Dodge action.
* Must immediately use all its movement in a random direction. Roll 1d4 to determine the direction: 1—north, 2—east, 3—south, 4—west.

At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If it did not move during its turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the creature falls Prone and the effect ends for it.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The affected creature takes 1d10 Bludgeoning damage whenever it moves due to the spell. This damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

You unleash a torrent of overwhelming emotion—blending agony and euphoria into a maddening storm. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw (a creature can choose to fail).

On a failed save, a creature is affected by the Rampaging* condition for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. The creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if it damaged another creature with an attack during that turn.

When you cast the spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. Affected creatures in the area have disadvantage on Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration.

The spell ends early if you move more than 60 feet away from the point where it was cast.

**Crippling Pain.** A creature suffering from Crippling Pain is affected as follows:

* Any speed it has cannot exceed 15 feet.

* Each time it takes a move, action, bonus action, or reaction, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage, or 6d8 necrotic damage if the action was used to cast a spell of 3rd or higher level. This damage cannot reduce the target's hit points below 1.

**Mild Pain.** A creature suffering from mild pain takes 2d8 Necrotic damage whenever it takes a move, action, bonus action, or reaction. This damage cannot reduce the target's hit points below 1.

You conjure a cloud of razor-sharp glass and launch it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 Slashing damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an additional 6d6 Psychic damage, or half as much on a successful one.

If the attack misses, the shards still graze the target, which takes half the Slashing damage and suffers no additional effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the Slashing and Psychic damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Drowsy

> * It moves at half speed.<br>
> * It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
> * It can't concentrate. <br>
> * Attacks against it have advantage. <br>

> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.

## Gifts of Excess
Powerful demons or cults of excess and decadence will sometimes craft magical items which channel their perverse powers.  They may wield these items themselves or gift them to worthy followers.  The following magic items can be used to represent these gifts of excess in your campaign.

#### Beguiling Gem
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This entrancing gemstone can be incorporated into any piece of jewelry and glows with a pinkish hue that beguiles anyone who comes near it. While you are wearing this gem, any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become Obsessed* with you until the start of its next turn. If the creature succeeds, it is immune to this item's effects for 1 hour.

**New condition described at end of section*

#### Enrapturing Instrument
*Wonderous item, very rare*<br>
This enchanted item can take the form of any instrument but always requires two hands to use.  You can use an action to play it, and when you do so, every creature within 300 ft. of you that can hear its song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be Charmed by you until the song ends.  

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

You can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to continue playing and can stop at any time.  The song also ends if you are Incapacitated.

Creatures Charmed by you this way are Incapacitated.  If a Charmed creature is more than 5 ft. away from you, it must move on its turn toward you by the most direct route available.  The creature doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into dangerous terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than you, it can repeat the saving throw.  The creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.  If a creaure's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the effects of this instrument's song for 24 hours.

#### Instrument of Maddening Inspiration 
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*<br>
This item can take the form of any instrument but always requires two hands to use. You can use your action to play it and draw mad inspiration from the demonic realms of chaos. 

When you do so, you must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 10. 

*Success:* you regain one use of your Bardic Inspiration feature. 

*Failure:* You gain one random Madness of Excess from the table below. If you roll a madness that you already have, reroll until you gain a new one. The madness lasts until you finish a long rest.

Each time you regain a use of Bardic Inspiration using this item, the save DC of subsequent uses increases by 2. The save DC resets to 10 at the next dawn.  

If you have every madness effect from the Madness of Excess Effects table, you can't use this item until at least one of them has cleared.

##### Madness of Excess Effects
| 1d6  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|
| 1  | **Avarice.** You cannot willingly let go of any objects. If an item is taken from you, you take 1 Psychic damage. |
| 2  | **Carnality.** You are Charmed by all other creatures. If any creature harms you, you are no longer Charmed by that creature.  |
| 3  | **Gluttony.** You must eat a day’s worth of rations every 3 hours or suffer one level of exhaustion. |
| 4  | **Indolence.** You require 3 hours for a short rest and 24 hours for a long rest. |
| 5  | **Paramountcy.** You have disadvantage on all Wisdom ability checks. |
| 6  | **Vainglory.** Whenever you roll a natural 20 on a d20 test, treat it as if you rolled a 1. | 


\columnbreak

#### Lash of Despair
*Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunment)*<br>
This wicked whip unleashes waves of soul-rending torment with each crack.  Once per turn, when you hit a creature with this whip, you can choose to deal an additional 2d6 Psychic damage to it and all creatures within 5 feet of it.

#### Masque of Subversion
*Wonderous item, legendary (requires attunement)*<br>
This hauntingly beautiful mask beguiles and bewitches those who would cause its wearer harm.  While wearing this mask, if a creature you can see within 120 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the attacker must target another creature within range of the attack other than you.  

If multiple creatures are within range, the attacker chooses which one to target.  If no other creatures are within range of the attack, the attack is wasted.

#### Rapier of Ecstatic Conquest
*Weapon (rapier), rare*<br> 
This thin, elegant blade is engraved with thousands of whispering, red-lipped mouths, and it can bestow crippling bliss with the slightest scratch.  Attacks with this rapier score a critical hit on an attack roll of 19 or 20.  Additionally, creatures struck by a critical hit from this weapon are Drowsy* until the end of your next turn.

#### Wit Stealer Sword
*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This blade inflames the minds of creatures gripped by emotion, leaving them dazed and overwhelmed by chaotic thoughts. 

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and attacks made with it deal an additional 1d6 Psychic damage. If you hit a creature with this weapon that is Charmed, Drowsy*, Frightened, or Obsessed*, it is Dazed* until the end of its next turn.

# Creatures of Excess

## Demonettes
*Debauched Fiends of Pleasure & Pain*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Implements <br>
The unsettlingly alluring demons known as demonettes are the most numerous demons of pleasure. These creatures vary in appearance, but their most common features include the figure of an androgynous humanoid with pastel skin adorned with winding tattoos that form dizzying patterns across their bodies. They stand on avian legs, and in place of hands, they sport crab-like claws. Sinuous tails extend from their backs, ending in tufts of pluming hair. Upon their sculpted faces are delicate mouths that, when parted, reveal polished rows of dagger-like fangs, and above them, cold, onyx eyes dance with twisted reflections of all that the beast fixes its gaze upon. Though most sound of mind would be repulsed or outright revolted by the demons’ appearance, the limber movements of their horrific forms, the cloying fragrances wafting from their hides, and the melodic sound of their speech create a beguiling haze that captivates those who draw too close.

demonettes are sin given physical form, existing to carry out all manner of licentious acts, with inflicting pain chief among their vices. 

\columnbreak

<br>

A demonette glides toward its prey with otherworldly alacrity, swinging chitinous claws, talon-tipped feet, and a barbed tongue in graceful arcs across flesh, bestowing titillating agony upon awestruck victims, many of whom invite such an enrapturing death after being overwhelmed by the demon’s mesmerizing aura.

Great demons of excess command entire harems of demonettes at their beck and call. These eager servants perform a multitude of dark deeds, striding in great numbers to battle to savage any who oppose their master, dispatched to seduce individuals and lead them down the path of damnation, or offered as gifts to be indulged in by mortal champions who have earned the fickle favor of their patron. Yet no act induces more euphoria in a demonette than tending to the depraved whims of their lord’s court.


***Exalted Demonettes.*** Demonettes who master the art of debauchery to a level that stimulates or amuses their patron enough to stand out from their master’s entourage, even for a fleeting moment, are elevated to exalted demonettes. These demons can smell the intoxicating stench of mortals overcome with emotion and are quick to bear down on such individuals. A single caress from their bladed limbs causes feelings to flare, plunging the mind into delightful agony.

***Bringers of Beguilement.*** Some demonettes become fixated on a particular type of pleasure, which they pursue and consume interminably. For the demonettes known as Bringers of Beguilement, this is instigating frenzied massacres. It does not satisfy the voracious appetite of this breed to merely rip apart helpless admirers drunken on their presence. Instead, they use their hypnotic aura to awaken bloodlust in the hearts of those entangled in it. Such afflicted onlookers throw themselves into a heedless rage at the beguiler, who eagerly embraces the oncoming throng with bladed arms, demon and mortal alike partaking in a grand slaughter.



<br>

> ##### New Condition: Obsessed 
> The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> * The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed, frightened  or obsessed effects on the creature are suspended.

***Demonette Commanders.*** Alluresses and heralds of excess, demonette commanders have delved into forbidden delights to capture the attention of their unholy liege, ascending to become their most prized courtesans. These favored concubines are granted the privilege of leading brigades of their lesser kin in malignant hunts. They are also sent to the mortal plane to enact rakish rituals and celebrations in praise of their sinful lord. At times, they are dispatched to seek out specific individuals, whether to deliver divine orders or gifts to a forsworn agent of their master or to tempt those with the purest souls with a plethora of pleasures, freeing them from moral strictures. Such corruption is the most satisfying of acts.

\columnbreak

#### Locus of Indulgence Abilities
The demonettes who serve as commanders draw power from the chaotic winds of magic and pass that power onto the demons they lead. Every Alluress and Herald of Excess has one of the following abilities.

***Locus of Swiftness.*** The demonette's speed increases by 10 feet, and it ignores difficult terrain. Additionally, whenever a demon of excess enters the aura for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in the aura, it gains these same benefits until the end of the turn.

***Locus of Grace*** When a demon of excess in the aura is hit with an attack or is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the damage is halved if the source of the attack or effect is more then 15 feet away from it.

***Locus of Beguilement.*** The commander's Aura of Indulgence extends out to a 30-foot emanation, and the saving throw becomes 17 + 1 per creature with the Aura of Indulgence trait within the aura. Increase the base DC to 18 for a Herald of Excess.

### Demonette Tactics
Demonettes attack in packs to amplify their Aura of Indulgence. They charge into groups of enemies, prioritizing targets that succumb to their aura. If multiple targets are affected, or no creatures are affected by their aura, they focus on the target with the lowest Armor Class (AC).

**Bringers of Beguilement.** These demons are best used against spellcasters, and will rush directly toward them in combat. 

#### Demonette Commanders
Commanders stay close to other demonettes to maximize the potency of their Aura of Indulgence. Their tactics may vary based on specific circumstances or the presence of a Locus of Excess (see below).

##### Alluress Spells
* **Phantasmagoria:** Cast first to increase the likelihood that enemies fail against the Aura of Indulgence.
* **Hysterical Frenzy:** Cast on the largest group of creatures, prioritizing spellcasters. Alluresses prioritize this spell over *phantasmagoria* if they can target three or more spellcasting enemies.
* **Slicing Shards:** Used as a final spell when the Alluress cannot engage a creature in melee or when no targets are vulnerable to additional Psychic damage from melee attacks.

##### Herald of Excess Spells
* **Cacophonic Caress:** Cast when targeting three or more creatures.
* **Hysterical Frenzy:** Same as tactics as the Alluresses.
* **Slicing Shards:** Targets highly mobile enemies (e.g., rogues or monks) when the herald cannot engage in melee or when no targets are susceptible to additional Psychic damage from melee attacks.

##### Locus of Excess
* **Locus of Swiftness:** Does not alter the commander’s tactics.
* **Locus of Grace:** The commander prioritizes melee fighters over ranged attackers, as ranged attacks deal less damage to them.
* Locus of Beguilement: Allows the commander to spread out without weakening their Aura of Indulgence. This enables the use of the Obsessed condition to isolate enemies from their allies.

### Demonette Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Demonette Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Steeds of Excess
*Swift Mounts & Profane Hunters*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** None <br>

In the dark realm of desires that drift lazily within the realms of chaos, herds of strange creatures tread with long, raptor-like legs across gilded fields. A dazzling palette of hues adorns the throng of beasts, their silken-haired manes running the length of their serpentine bodies from muscular tails to elongated, smooth heads. Long, forked tongues flicker forth from their toothless, round mouths to taste the perfumed air for emotions.

Born from the deepest yearnings of mortal souls, these demonic stalkers can smell the feelings of longing emanating from their quarry. Each soul leaves a unique aroma lingering in the air, which the beasts can distinguish and track like hounds, even across realms of existence. As they close the distance to their prize, their whip-like tongues lash out to halt their prey, for their saliva contains a potent narcotic that numbs the muscles, overwhelms the senses, and fills the mind with intrusive thoughts of taboo desires.

Demonettes, who delight in toying with mortals, mount these creatures to aid in their cruel escapades. Demonette and mount stalk their victim, allowing it to sense their presence just out of sight, only to flit away when noticed. Periodically, the fiendish pair gives chase, letting the victim barely outpace them, within a hair’s breadth of the mount’s stupefying tongue, only to break off the hunt when the victim is drained—mentally and physically—to the point of collapse. Such antics may continue for years without end, as the agonized victim lives in constant dread of their tormenting pursuers. Eventually, these souls succumb, no longer fleeing, and allow themselves to be whisked away to an eternity of agony. For none can out run their own yearnings.

### Eternal Admirer
Eternals admirers are a variation of these demonic mounts, manifested from reverence and worship of false icons. Upon taking form, they seek out powerful champions or demons of great decadence, whom they unwaveringly serve, pampering them with soothing purrs, honeyed perfumes excreted from their hides, and strokes of their intoxicating tongues. These devoted steeds are prized, for beyond the pleasures they induce, they instinctively know the object their master’s twisted heart most yearns for and its location. They tirelessly carry their master across countless lands until the source of their desire stands before them.


When an idol of Chaos strides into battle atop such an adoring mount—or, worse, an entire entourage of swooning beasts—they are lavished with exuberant praise, bolstering their already inflamed egos and driving them to perform grand acts of martial prowess.


### Steeds of Excess and Eternal Admirer Tactics
Steeds of excess employ hit-and-run tactics, repeatedly striking to poison their target until it becomes paralyzed. When guided by mounted demonettes, these steeds target creatures capable of dealing significant damage to the pair through means such as spells or abilities requiring strength or wisdom saving throws.

|  1  | **The Endless Pursuit:** A prominent merchant’s heir has been haunted for months by a pair of steeds of excess and their demonette riders—always just out of reach, sowing madness with their narcotic saliva. When the scion collapses in the street, mumbling of forbidden longings, the party is hired to track down and stop these tormentors once and for all—or rescue the victim before they willingly follow their pursuers into oblivion. |
|  2  |**Blood & Silk:** Caravans trading rare silks and perfumes are systematically ambushed in the desert, their drivers found comatose beneath bizarre hoofprints. The party is enlisted as caravan guards—but soon learns the raiders are demonettes on steeds of excess. To break the cycle, they must guard not only coin but the caravan’s collective willpower, resisting temptations sown into their very minds.  |
|  3  |**Carousel of Cravings:**  A traveling carnival arrives bearing wonders—and a carousel of living steeds of excess that guests can “ride” for an otherworldly thrill. Those who dismount emerge enthralled, their ambitions twisted into dangerous obsessions. The party must expose the demonette ringmaster and free the riders before the town is emptied of its most capable citizens.   |
|  4  | **The Allure of Redemption:**  A fallen paladin, haunted by regrets, has bonded with an eternal admirer that soothes her torment with honeyed perfumes and whispered promises of redemption. When she leads an army of atonement-seekers into a neighboring realm, the party must decide whether to break the steed’s hold—risking her sanity—or find another way to thwart the crusade.  |


### Steed of Excess Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

## Chariots of Excess
Forged from gleeful dreams of sadism, the demonic implements of war known as chariot of excess carry demons of excess to the field of battle. Their elegant frames, woven from luminous metal, with a circular array of curving blades serving as wheels. When these nightmarish contraptions gain momentum from the laboring demonic steeds lashed to them, the scythed wheels scream with the echoes of past victims. As the chariot reaches its maximum velocity, the blades become a blur, sweeping though throngs of soldiers. Fountains of blood and confetti of bone burst skyward like macabre fireworks. Some are not cut down by the eviscerating wheels but are instead impaled on the brambled hull of the chariot and carried off. These victims will wish for the merciful end of being sliced into nothingness beneath the whirling machine, for the hungry demon riders guiding these vehicles of mayhem seize the opportunity to lavish cruel attention on their new passengers.

### Hellflayers
Hellflayers, deadly variants of chariots of excess, able to tear into the very souls of those caught within their cycling blades. Chunks of the victims’ essence are hewn off, blending into an incense that wafts from the chariot. The demonic crew basks in these potent fragrances, igniting a ravenous urge for suffering that drives them into hysterical mania, eagerly seeking to gratify their cravings. As hellflayers and their invigorated crews whisk through parades of violence, only the strange scent of souls lingers in the air, amid fields of crisp and mushy remains.

### Chariots of Excess Tactics
Chariots of excess are typically crewed by demonettes and pulled by steeds of excess. The chariot aims to charge through as many targets as possible, ensuring it does not end its movement too close to unrestrained opponents to maintain space for continuous charges. It avoids targets with high Strength to minimize the risk of being stopped. The crew can quickly dispatch any opponents restrained by the chariot.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

### Chariots of Excess Loot
These demonic chariots are extraplanar in nature and typically dissolve away when destroyed, similarly to demons. However, you may have these chariots leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the chariot that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the chariots to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where they were destroyed to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the chariots. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.

## Fiends of Excess
*Sadistic & Hypnotic Tormentors*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** None <br>
Fiends of excess are creatures born as if from some hedonistic delirium, their segmented bodies resembling a scorpion’s but adorned with soft, luminous skin instead of chitinous armor. Multiple rows of androgynous limbs grace their forms, two of which end in polished cloven hooves. The abomination’s upper body curves upward, flanked by a pair of gleaming pincers on either side of its upright chest. Its long, slender face ends in a forked tongue, and a wild mane of oiled fur flows from atop its head, cascading down its back. Ornate ivory horns spiral outward to crown its head, while its many eyes burn with a yearning for torment. Most notable is its coiling tail, tipped with a massive stinger.

These merciless and swift hunters hunger for flesh and souls tenderized by torment. Their heightened senses detect such morsels, and their multitude of limbs carries them across all manner of obstacles with a rhythmic gallop, each graceful step producing a hypnotic beat.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 As their strange, waltz-like movements bring them closer to their prey, the fiends emit a haunting whir—a subtle but intrusive symphony that nettles all who hear it. As the fiend descends with its deadly array of lightning-fast appendages, a potent musk bears down on its victims’ faculties, casting them into a haze that clouds reason, leaving them sluggish, stumbling, or lurching half-cocked in random directions. In rare cases, when a target is not numbed by this miasma, the fiend’s stinger delivers a sedative potent enough to render even a raging ogre weary and induce a coma. So overwhelming is the intoxicating presence of these monsters that a single fiend can plunge a well-trained army into bewildered discord.

### Fiends of Excess Tactics
Fiends of excess act as disruptors, diminishing their enemies' action economy. When allied with high-damage-dealing creatures, their primary goal is to move among multiple targets, dazing and knocking as many unconscious as possible while grappling targets with low Dexterity and Strength to reposition them unfavorably. When operating alone, a fiend of excess focuses on incapacitating a single target and swiftly dragging it away.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

\columnbreak

<br><br>
<br>
> ##### New Condition: Drowsy 
> This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
> * It moves at half speed.<br>
> * It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
> *  It can't concentrate. <br>
> * Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
> * The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

>
> ### Actions
>

>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) Slashing damage, and the target is Grappled (escape DC 16) by one of the fiend’s claws. The fiend can Grapple up to two creatures at a time.

>
> *Failure:* The creature is Drowsy*. The target can make a DC 16 Constitution save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends. Alternatively, a creature can end the effect by using an action to empty a vial of holy water on the target.
>
> *Failure by 5+:* The creature falls Unconscious until the Drowsy effect ends.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
>
> ***Disruptive Song.*** The fiend sings a haunting melody. Any non-demon of excess creature within a 120-foot emanation originating from the fiend that can hear it has disadvantage on saving throws to maintain concentration until the start of the fiend’s next turn.

### Fiend of Excess Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check.  

#### Fiend of Excess Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Keepers of The Forbidden
*Enthralling Masters of Pain, Pleasure, & Temptation*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Implements <br>
These greater demons are paragons of unfettered desire and destructive obsession. The forms they assume are varied, but they are all huge fiends with vaguely humanoid forms that feature an amalgam of male, female, and bestial features. These bodies sport arms that end in diamond-sharp claws, and they move at such speed in combat that they appear to be a blur of motion. They are both terrifying and beautiful to behold, their cruel and sensual forms entrancing and unnatural, breaking the wills of all but the most disciplined of onlookers. 

Keepers of the forbidden drive mortals to push every experience to the extreme, and those under their influence lose themselves in pursuit of new sensations and experiences. These pursuits may begin with frenzied artistic creation or the indulgence of forbidden pleasures, but they soon devolve into depraved acts of self-gratification and sadism. Passion turns to obsession, and each hedonistic pursuit must exceed the one that came before as the mortal quickly loses themselves in a spiral of indulgence. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

These fiends eagerly partake in the cruel, hedonistic frenzies they induce, using their elegant great blades to masterfully cut a swath through awed onlookers, each slice moving with the grace of a dancer and each blood splatter painting the ground with the aesthetic precision of an artist. Even those who resist their charms find themselves facing a martial master wielding overwhelmingly seductive magics. 

To make matters worse, these fiends rarely work alone and are usually accompanied by cadres of sycophantic followers eager to please the keeper in any perverse way possible. These may be entranced mortal worshippers or lesser demons seeking to indulge in the keeper's revelries. Together, these debauched hedonists travel the mortal realm and perhaps even worlds beyond, causing unholy chaos and suffering in their eternal pursuit of extreme excesses. 

Those keepers of the forbidden who manage to achieve these excesses grow in power until they become known as exalted keepers of the forbidden. These demons are among the rarest and most powerful demons of excess in existence, for they have experienced sensations beyond the comprehension of most beings and are driven to experience yet more. They will bring about the fall of nations and wreak havoc across the cosmos just to satisfy their mad desires, and once their attention is fixed on someone or something, nothing can curb their eternal obsession.

### The Marquis of Delirium
Keepers of the forbidden typically corrupt their mortal victims by playing on their desires and edging them toward the pursuit of excessive material pleasure. Each pursuit leads to another, more perverse, pursuit as the corrupted mortal plunders the world around them in search of ever greater excesses. However, the physical limits of the material world eventually provide an increasingly difficult barrier to overcome as the obsessed mortal pushes for ever more depraved experiences. Even demons as powerful as keepers of change are limited in terms of the experiences they can inflict while they are within the confines of the Material Plane.

The Marquis of Delierim is a devious keeper of change who has found a way around this predicament. The experiences he provides are in the form of ever-changing illusions that partially dwell within the Ethereal Plane. The form these illusions take is limited only by the imaginations of their victims, and the more the Marquis's victims indulge in them, the more real they seem. Not bound by the laws of the Material Plane, the illusions provided by the Marquis shift and grow to meet the increasing demands of their obsessed onlookers. Eventually, the captured victims lose touch with reality and become trapped in an illusionary existence of ever-increasing depraved madness and terror.

The Marquis visits societies where peace and abundance have created apathy and discontent. Those who are unfulfilled by their humdrum lives are susceptible to the influence of his illusions and often begin relying on them as addictive pass times and substitutes for more substantive pursuits. The Marquis takes delight in witnessing the degeneration of those who throw away their potential for his illusory pleasures, and nothing satisfies him more than inflicting this on a mass scale, potentially leading entire civilizations into ruin as their populations lose the will to participate in daily life.

Though the Marquis prefers to seduce victims with illusory temptations rather than engage in direct confrontation, he is more than capable of dealing with foes who would challenge him directly. In combat, the Marquis masterfully wields spells of shadow and illusion, unleashing nightmarish magic upon his foes. Worse still, his illusory minions, normally used to tempt mortals, can be turned into nightmarish apparations capable of driving onlookers to the point of madness, and the further the victims descend into delirium, the more vulnerable they become to the illusions. In the end, most who challenge the Marquis meet the same fate as those he seduces: lost in a shadowy world of ephemeral desires and endless terrors of their own making.

### Keeper of The Forbidden Tactics
Keepers of the forbidden wield a vast array of spells, a debilitating aura, and attacks that prevent foes from escaping. Below is the prioritized list of actions the keeper takes in combat:

**1. Dominate Monster/Dominate Person**
* Cast when the keeper can surprise its foes.
* Targets frontline fighters, commanding them to attack backline fighters.

**2. Phantasmagoria**
* Targets the area with the largest group of creatures.
* The keeper makes a claw attack against any creatures outside the area, dragging them into it to maximize the effect of its aura.

**3. Cacophonic Call**
* Affects as many creatures as possible.
* Follows up with a full attack action.

**4. Power Word Stun**
* Cast on creatures concentrating on a 7th-level or higher spell.

**5. Multi-Attack**
* Use claws to Grapple ranged foes.
* Use the Soul Feasting Greatblade on targets suffering from debilitating conditions or those posing the greatest threat (e.g., creatures capable of reducing the keeper’s speed to zero or removing debilitating conditions).

**6. Slashing Shard**
* Cast instead of Multi-Attack if:
    * A target is Stunned, or
    * The keeper is unable to move or reach other targets.

**Reaction: Instinctive Charm**
* Reserved for powerful single-target attacks, such as a rogue’s Sneak Attack or a *firebolt* cantrip.

### Keepers of The Forbidden Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Keepers of The Forbidden Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Keepers of the Forbidden New Conditions Reference

#### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.



#### New Condition: Obsessed 
 The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
 * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
 * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
 *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

#### New Condition: Rampaging
 The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
 * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
 * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
 * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.


#### New Condition: Drowsy 
 This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
 * It moves at half speed.<br>
 * It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
 *  It can't concentrate. <br>
 * Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
 * The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

## N'Kharis, The Arch-Tempter
*Supreme Fiend of Excess & Defiler of All That is Pure*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Armaments <br>
In legend, there is an ancient sea where grey waters are churned by a relentless maelstrom that spins without cease. At the heart of this storm lies a beast, yearning for the most depraved of pleasures. Great was this beast, known in ages past as N'Kharis, the Arch-Tempter, for no other spawn of discord has led so many to sin with its whispers. It promised to indulge their darkest cravings, fattening their souls with depravity before consuming their defiled essence. So profound was the evil it fostered that wicked gods chose the beast to lead their fiendish children, spreading corruption across the land. As the tide of defilement rose, the Arch-Tempter drank deeply of the despair it wrought.

Yet through the darkness, heroes of the mortal realm devised a plan to end such atrocities. On a small island, a great battle erupted between the mightiest warriors of light and the Arch-Tempter with his depraved minions. The conflict raged for days and nights, as demons battered the defenders without end. The struggle continued until no brave soldiers remained, broken in a bloody heaps, with the monstrous horde converging on the last great champion, led by the great demon itself. The battle was vicious; the demon lord's claws snapped, and its enrapturing voice wove incantations of excess to break the champion's resolve. Yet the champion stood with conviction.

As he finally collapsed, a great spell crafted by the priests of light was completed, springing a trap.  The island was devoured by raging winds and waves of potent magic, washing away the demons and scattering their essence. The Arch-Tempter was torn asunder, its soul cast deep into the heart of the great conflux.

And so, the world's wounds begin to heal, and its scars faded over time. Yet the bitter beast's soul circled within its mystic prison, its harrowing cries breaching the barriers and drifting across the waves to distant shores. These echoes haunted the dreams of sleeping men, promising that all which transpires in while they slept could become reality if they surrendered but a small part of their spirit to be carried across the vast sea to the ever-turning storm. Over the waxing and waning of countless moons, the voice of the great demon has drawn shards of tainted souls back to its master across starlit sea. Soon, the gleaming hoard gathered in the eye of the demon's raging cage will grow so vast that it shatters the mighty storm. The island lying at the bottom of that great sea will stir, rising upward to breach the tides. The Arch-Tempter's body shall be remade, standing tall, proud, and monstrous upon the cliffs of the arisen island. From there, the beast will gaze over the vast waves toward distant kingdoms, weaving its impious promises to guide the masses from the path of righteous striving to the grand pleasures of damnation.

### N'Kharis's Layer
Where N'Kharis's wicked influence takes hold, palaces of decadence rise, constructed by enslaved mortals and cruel demonic servants. Within their cavernous depths, all manner of debauched acts unfold, indulging desires far beyond any earthly constraints.

#### Lair Actions
When N'Kharis rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or The N'Kharis dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 22 and can act of its own accord, always in N'Kharis's best interest. While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair selects an unoccupied 10-foot cube on the ground within the lair and causes an Effigy of Sin to appear there, filling the space for 1 minute. The Effigy has an AC of 16, 75 hit points, and is immune to Poison, Psychic, and Thunder damage. It emanates an aura in a 10-foot radius. Creatures corrupted by N'Kharis's Aura of Temptaion trait within the aura have advantage on d20 tests and automatically fail all saving throws to end their Corruption. Creatures Burdened with Sin by N'Kharis's Aura of Temptaion trait within the aura have their damage rolls halved.

#### Regional Effects
Any region where N'Kharis dwells for a significant amount of time becomes warped by his magic, creating the following effects within 10 miles of his lair:

If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into madness, as determined by the Madness of Excess table. After making this saving throw, it can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

#### Epic N'Kharis Battle
If you wish to make The N'Kharis into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 1113, and give him the Willing Prey trait, described below. This increases his CR to 28.

***Willing Prey (Recharges after a short or long rest).*** If N'Kharis becomes Bloodied (556 HP), he may end any spells affecting him. Additionally, for the next hour, on initiative count 1 (losing ties), N'Kharis telepathically offers each non-Incapacitated creature within 60 feet of him who isn't Corrupted by his Aura of Temptation trait a chance to offer him their soul. If more than one creature accepts, he can choose one. If none do, he can choose any creature within 60 feet of him. The chosen or willing creature takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, or 39 (6d12) necrotic damage if it is Burdened with Sin from his Aura of Temptation trait. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies, and N'Kharis regains 50 hit points.

\columnbreak

##### Madness of Excess Effects
| 1d6  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|
| 1  | **Avarice.** The creature can't willingly let go of any objects. It takes 1 psychic damage whenever an item is taken from it.|
| 2  | **Carnality.** When the creature gains this madness, it becomes Charmed by all other creatures. If a creature harms it, the Charm ends for that creature. Upon finishing a long rest, it becomes Charmed by all other creatures once again.  |
| 3  | **Gluttony.** The creature must eat a days worth of rations every 3 hours or suffer a level of Exhaustion. |
| 4  | **Indolence.** Short rests require 3 hours for the creature and long rests 24 hours to finish. |
| 5  | **Paramountcy** The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks.
| 6  | **Vainglory.** Whenver the creature rolls a 20 on a D20 test, it treats the roll as if it rolled 1.  

##### N’Kharis Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Whispers on the Wind.** As a coastal town reels from a summer of strange, erotic dreams, villagers awake humming with unfamiliar longing—some vanish overnight. The party is hired to investigate the dream-haunting breezes, tracing them to a crashed shard of N’Kharis’s soul buried beneath the sand. They must destroy the shard before the Arch-Tempter’s voice spreads further. |
|  2  | **Stormbreaker’s Gambit.** The party uncovers an ancient ritual that can shatter N’Kharis’s psychic dominion—but it must be performed at the eye of the everlasting maelstrom. They charter a magically reinforced ship, sail into the howling gale, and plant arcane anchors on the churning waters. When N’Kharis manifests an avatar of his physical form, the heroes must defeat him to bind his wickedness once more. |
|  3  | **Corruptor of Dreams.** N’Kharis reaches into the dreams of the players, challenging them to face depraved challenges in a shared slumber-scape. The players must navigate a twisting labyrinth formed from their own secret desires to face N’Kharis and banish him from their hearts for good.  |
|  4  | **Eye of the Tempter.** A remote lighthouse built atop a sunken fortress has become the pivot of N’Kharis’s planar breach. Inside its depths lies an obsidian mirror that serves as his eye, projecting his will into the world. The party delves through flooded corridors, bypasses soul-eating wards, and faces the mirror’s guardians—until at last the glass shatters, and N’Kharis’s visage steps through to parley… or to kill. |

> ### Traits
>
> ***Aura of Temptation.*** On initiative count 30 (losing ties), N'Kharis telepathically offers each non-Incapacitated creature within 60 feet of it the Gift of Corruption. If more than one creature accepts, N'Kharis can choose one. If none accept, each non-demon of excess creature within a 60-foot radius emanating from N'Kharis must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. N'Kharis then may choose one creature that failed the saving throw to become Corrupted. While Corrupted, the creature experiences the following effects: 
> * On initiative count 29 (losing ties), the creature takes an extra turn under N'Kharis’s complete control. 
> * The creature can’t cast 4th-level or higher spells, can’t take reactions, and skips its normal turn. 
> * If damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies, and N'Kharis regains 50 hit points. 
> * Whenever a Corrupted creature takes damage or is subjected to an effect that would end the Charmed condition, it can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the Corruption ends, and the creature is Burdened with Sin for 1 hour. <br>
> A creature that is Burdened with Sin cannot become Corrupted or accept N'Kharis’s Gift of Corruption. 
> 
> <br>***Avoidance.*** If N'Kharis is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
>
> ***Blurred Movement.*** Attack rolls against N'Kharis have disadvantage unless its speed is 10 ft. or lower or it is Incapacitated.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** N'Kharis makes three attacks.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is Grappled (escape DC 21) by one of N'Kharis’s two claws.
>
> ***Witstealer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) Slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) Psychic. If the target is Charmed, Drowsy*, Frightened, Obsessed*, or Rampaging*, it is Dazed* until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** N'Kharis casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks): <br>
> *At will:* *dispel magic*, *nystul’s magic aura* (self only), *phantasmagoria***, *slashing shards*** <br>
> *1/day each:* *cacophonic call***, *glibness*, *power word: stun***, *project image* <br>
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***War Caster.*** When N'Kharis uses his action to cast an at-will spell, he can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Instinctive Charm.***  *Trigger:* When a creature N'Kharis can see within 120 feet of it makes an attack roll against it. <br>
> *Response:* The attacker must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 22. *Failure:* The attacker must target another creature within range of the attack other than N'Kharis. If multiple creatures are within range, the attacker chooses which one to target. If no other creatures are within range, the attack is wasted. <br>
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> N'Kharis gains two additional actions in combat: Soul Seize and Alacritous Strikes. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count, separate from N'Kharis’s. On the action’s initiative count (losing ties), N'Kharis can take one of these actions if it is not Incapacitated. It can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Soul Seize (Initiative Count 16).*** N'Kharis can move up to 30 feet. He then casts *command*. If the target is Burdened with Sin by his Aura of Temptation trait and fails the saving throw, it is Charmed by N'Kharis until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Alacritous Strikes (Initiative Count 6).*** N'Kharis can move up to 30 feet. During this movement, he can make one Witstealer attack. If the attack targets a creature Burdened with Sin by his Aura of Temptation trait, N'Kharis can immediately make another Witstealer attack against that creature.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If N'Kharis is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

### N'Khari Tactics
N'Kharis's tactics revolve around corrupting enemies. If no creature willingly succumbs to corruption, N'Kharis targets the creature with the highest health. Creatures that attempt to break corruption—either by dealing small amounts of damage or applying effects that remove the charm condition—become N'Kharis's primary targets, and he directs corrupted creatures to attack them.

#### Prioritized Combat Actions
N'Kharis follows this prioritized list of actions in combat:

1. Phantasmagoria
    *  Targets the largest group of creatures, ensuring as many corrupted creatures as possible are within the area.
    *  Uses a claw attack to drag creatures outside the area into it, maximizing the effect of its aura.
2. Cacophonic Call
    * Affects as many creatures as possible and will choose to affect corrupted creatures within a *phantasmagoria* spell’s area or near an Effigy of Sin.
    * Follows up with a full attack action.
3. Power Word Stun
    * Cast on creatures concentrating on a 7th-level or higher spell.
4. Multi-Attack
    * Uses claws to grapple ranged fighters.
    * Uses the Witstealer Blade instead if it can Daze targets.
5. Slashing Shard
    * Cast instead of Multi-Attack if:
        * A target is Stunned, or
        * N'Kharis cannot move or reach other targets.
##### Monstrous Actions
* **Soul Seize:** Used on a creature with sin that has the lowest Wisdom.
* **Alacritous Strikes:** Targets a creature with sin that is Charmed by Soul Seize or Feared by *cacophonic call*.

##### Epic N'Kharis Battle
* This does not affect N'Kharis’s tactics.

##### Lair Actions
* N'Kharis places Effigies of Sin near creatures with corruption. It also drags creatures with sin into these areas to reduce their damage output.

### N'Kharis Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed from the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### N'Kharis Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### N'Kharis Loot Table

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 | Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1d4(2) 20,000gp Items |
|  10-14 | 1d6(3) 20,000gp Items | 
|  15-25 | 1 100,000gp Item  |  
|  26+ | 1d4(2) 100,000gp Items |  


#### Example N'Kharis Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Legendary/Mythic Demon of Excess Item Names
|1d10 | 20,000gp Item | 100,000gp Item

# Gifts of Excess
This section lists options for customizing creatures with abilities associated with the demonic forces of excess. By using these options, you can incorporate creatures not normally associated with these forces into adventures centering on demons of excess. These creatures could be worshippers of excess, or they may have been seduced by beguiling magics that altered them and granted new powers.

## Abilities of Excess

This section lists different abilities you can add to creatures to make them more thematically aligned with a demonic theme. Each ability added to a creature increases its CR by 1. Though this isn’t an exact science, as different abilities will synergize better with some creatures than others, so use your best judgment.

A creature with a demonic ability is considered to be a creature of that ability’s theme, ex a creature with a demonic ability from the excess theme is a Creature of Excess.

Some of these abilities will require a saving throw. Use the CR of the creature with the ability to determine the DC for the save, as shown below:

* CR 4 or lower - DC 13 
* CR 5 to 8 - DC 15
* CR 9 to 12 - DC 17
* CR 13 to 16 - DC 18
* CR 17+ - DC 19


#### Unnatural Grace

*The creature's movements are so mesmerizingly graceful that they befuddle the minds of its foes.*

 When the creature takes the Dash or Dodge action, it does not provoke opportunity attacks and can move through another creature's space as long as that creature is not immune to being charmed. If the creature ends its turn in another creature's space, it is pushed to the nearest unoccupied space.


#### Complete Abandonment
*The creature forsakes all reason in its pursuit of the pleasures of bloodshed.*

 At the start of the creature's turn, if it has half its hit points or fewer, it goes Berserk* for one minute. While Berserk this way, any melee weapon attacks it makes that hit are critical hits, and all attacks that hit the creature are also critical hits.

Once this ability triggers, it can't do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Intoxicating Strikes
*The creature's tormenting strikes can drive others to abandon any restraint.*

Once during the creature's turn, when it hits a creature with a melee attack, it can force that creature to make an Intelligence saving throw go Berserk* until the start of the creature's next turn.

#### Ego-Driven Superiority

*Arrogance gives the creature untold battle prowess for as long as it believes it is invincible.*

 The creature gets a +5 bonus to its weapon attack rolls. When an attack hits the creature or it fails a saving throw, the bonus is reduced by 1 as its ego becomes wounded. This reduction can happen up to once per turn and lasts until the creature finishes a short or long rest.

#### Captivating Presence

*The creature possesses an unholy allure that drives those in its presence to obsession.*

Any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of the gifted creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Obsessed* with it. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect automatically ends if there are no creatures with this ability within 30 feet of the Obsessed creature. Once a creature makes a successful saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the Captivating Presence of all creatures with this ability for 1 hour.

#### Obsessive Stalker

*The creature is prone to single-mindedly fixating on a new plaything that it refuses to let slip out of its grasp.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, it can choose one other creature it can see within 120 feet of it to become Obsessed* with. While it is Obsessed, its movement speed increases by 30 feet.

All attacks of opportunity by the gifted creature against the target creature are made with advantage, and the target creature provokes opportunity attacks from the gifted creature even if it takes the Disengage action before leaving its reach. If the attack hits, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.

If the target creature tries to teleport, it also provokes an attack of opportunity from the gifted creature. If the attack hits, the gifted creature may choose to teleport along with the target creature to the nearest unoccupied space next to it where it appears.

The obsession lasts until the creature it is Obsessed with dies or has not been seen by the gifted creature for over 1 minute.

The gifted creature cannot use this feature if it is already Obsessed with a creature.

## Lair Actions <br> of Excess

This section lists different lair actions you can give gifted creatures access to when they’re fighting at a location under the demonic influences of excess.

These may be locations desecrated by perverse cults, debauched pleasure dens, or decadent palaces ruled by cruel nobles.

You can give one or more creatures the ability to access two or more lair actions listed in this section that all belong to the same theme. Only one creature can take a lair action per round. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any creature with lair actions can take one lair action.

When you add lair actions to an encounter, you can treat the lair as an additional creature being added for the purposes of determining how it increases the encounter’s challenge rating. The equivalent CR of the lair depends on the average level of the players, as shown in the table below. If a lair action requires a saving throw, the DC of the save is determined by the equivalent CR of the lair. 

##### Lair Challenge Ratings (CRs)
| Party Level Range  | Lair CR | Lair Save DC |  
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1-4  | 1 | 13 |
|  5-8  | 2 | 15 |
|  9-12 | 3 |  17 |
|  13-16| 4 |   18 |
| 17-20 | 5 |  19 |

#### Dreadful Visage

The gifted creature summons the image of a horrifying demonic face in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 next turn. When a non-Creature of Excess creature first has line of sight of the image on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it.

#### Excruciating Blades

The gifted creature summons a swarm of jagged, spinning blades in a 10-foot cube within the lair. On initiative count 20 of the next turn, the cube moves 100 feet in a straight line toward the nearest non-Creature of Excess creature in the lair. Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn, starts its turn there, or is hit by the blades while it is moving, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes an amount of slashing damage determined by the lair's CR, and on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage:

* **CR 1:** 1d6 slashing damage
* **CR 2:** 2d6 slashing damage
* **CR 3:** 3d6 slashing damage
* **CR 4:** 4d6 slashing damage
* **CR 5:** 5d6 slashing damage

#### Mesmerizing Mirror

The gifted creature creates a cursed mirror in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 on the next turn. When a non-Creature of Excess creature first has line of sight of the mirror on its turn, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes mesmerized by the mirror, and all attacks have advantage against the creature while it has line of sight of the mirror, and it can't willingly move away from the mirror. Any creature that can't be charmed automatically succeeds on this saving throw.


#### Overwhelming Narcissism

The gifted creature chooses a creature within the lair that it is aware of. The chosen creature must make a Wisdom saving throw or become Obsessed* with itself. While <br> Obsessed this way, the creature's speed becomes 0. It or another creature within reach of it uses an action to shake the creature out of obsession, allowing the target to make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect <br> ends.


#### Sweet Sorrow

A creature within the lair that the gifted creature is aware of must make a Wisdom saving throw or release a scent of sorrow that other Creatures of Excess cannot resist. If the creature fails, each Creature of Excess within the lair may use its reaction to move up to its speed towards it without provoking attacks of opportunity and become Obsessed* with the creature until initiative count 20 on the next turn. While Obsessed with the creature, they know its exact location within the lair, and whenever they hit the creature with a melee weapon attack, they regain hit points equal to half the amount of damage dealt.

#### Wave of Depravity
 
Dark whispers echo through the lair, encouraging creatures to unleash their inner desires. Each non-Creature of Excess creature within the lair that can hear the whispers must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature goes Berserk* until the end of its next turn.

## Customizable Demons

The following demons aren’t specifically aligned with the forces of decay but can be used as a baseline for adding gifts of decay and other customizations to make them a part of your forces of decay. 

### Chaos Fury

These wicked, winged demons personify the unpredictable and volatile nature of chaos. They stand roughly three to four feet tall, with lean, muscular bodies that can take on various appearances depending on the influence of the demons they serve. Their wide, leathery wings grant them impressive speed and agility in flight, while their long, sharp claws allow them to easily slice through vulnerable flesh. 

Chaos furies are believed to be lesser demons, birthed from the raw energies of the realm of chaos. Their malleable and subservient nature means they are often used as agents of chaos by more powerful demons, sowing discord and confusion before a larger demonic incursion. Despite their small size and seemingly low threat level, these creatures' unpredictable and opportunistic nature allows them to wreak havoc on larger enemies. Chaos furies are cowardly by nature and will wait until they see vulnerable or isolated foes before striking at lightning speed, using hit-and-run attacks to prevent their prey from mounting an effective counterattack.

Unlike many other demons, chaos furies have not been intentionally created by any of the chaos gods and do not embody any specific dark impulses beyond simple, chaotic malevolence. As such, they are blank slates easily molded to suit the whims of their more powerful masters and wide varieties of chaos furies exist with a multitude of different demonic gifts and unique powers.

### Daemon Prince

Daemon princes, known also as the Ascended, the Exalted, and the Chaos-Born, are among the most potent and feared entities in the multiverse. These dread figures tower over most mortal creatures, their forms a terrifying blend of the mortal and the infernal, an unholy testament to their fallen nature. Standing at least twice the height of a man, they are the epitome of strength and power, a monstrous fusion of bone, muscle, and dark magic.

Daemon princes were once mortal beings, individuals of such extraordinary ambition and wickedness that they caught the attention of the dark gods of the outer planes. These mortals were elevated to their current status as a reward for their exceptional service, often having led armies, toppled kingdoms, or committed atrocities beyond mortal comprehension.

Their forms vary greatly, reflecting the nature of the dark power they serve, their own inherent characteristics, and the mortal form they once possessed. Some daemon princes retain a semblance of humanoid form, albeit grotesquely warped and augmented, while others are monstrous, having multiple limbs, horns, wings, or other more bizarre features.
Daemon Princes possess immense physical strength and durability, far surpassing that of most mortal creatures. Many are also gifted with potent magical abilities that reflect their patron's nature and realm, such as tormenting the minds of their foes, spreading decay, or twisting reality. The exact nature and extent of their abilities can vary greatly from one daemon prince to another.

The path to ascension into daemonhood is fraught with danger and torment. Many who attempt it fall into madness or are consumed by the very powers they sought to master, and most followers of the dark gods simply die violent deaths before achieving the glory needed to earn the favor of their patron. However, those who succeed are granted immortality and power beyond mortal comprehension, becoming the right hand of their dark patron and a prince among daemons.

While a daemon prince is a terrifying opponent, it is also a cautionary tale, a stark reminder of the terrible price of ambition unbound and the seductive lure of ultimate power.

### Soul Grinder

Daemonic soul grinders are monstrous constructs, a terrifying fusion of daemon and machine, that exist only to harvest souls for the chaotic deities of the outer planes. These enormous entities tower over the battlefield, their forms a grotesque blend of flesh and blackened iron covered in spines, skulls, and runes of power.

Soul grinders are characterized by their enormous grinding limbs and mechanical weaponry, which they use to obliterate their foes and consume their souls. The upper bodies of these constructs often resemble the daemons that inhabit them, with a multitude of eyes, horns, and mouths, while their lower bodies are mechanical, often taking the form of a monstrous, spiked wheel or multiple-legged apparatus.

The creation of a doul grinder is a horrific process that involves binding a powerful daemon within the cold iron shell of the construct. This process often drives the daemon insane, resulting in a creature of uncontrolled rage and hunger. 
This process also involves equipping the demon with various weapons that are fused into their tortured forms. Each soul grinder comes with a different arsenal of weapons at its disposal, which dictates their preferred forms of combat. Some wield devesting blades and crushing claws, others trample their foes under their mechanical legs, and others bombard their foes from a distance with fiendish artillery.

This fate is said to befall demons who were defeated and unable to fully reform within their demonic plane. Desperate for another chance to wreak havoc, they made a bargain with fiendish smiths who forged them into new bodies. Only by repaying the smiths with a tremendous tally of souls harvested from the Material Plane can the soul grinders be fully restored to their original forms. Those who fail to do so risk becoming trapped in their mechanical forms for eternity. In a cruel form of irony, soul grinders demonstrate that even demons can be damned to a greater form of tortured existence.

They may worship gods of hedonism, have succumbed to corrupting influences that played on their pride and ego, or have consorted with demonic forces to achieve everlasting beauty, charisma, and decadent pleasure. 

In battle, they see their foes as playthings and sources of amusement. The primary goal of these creatures is their own gratification, and they will fight in ways that they find most pleasing to themselves. This often involves toying with foes and using excessive cruelty in combat. Those who provide no pleasure are removed as quickly and efficiently as possible. 


### Perverse Cloud Giant (Cloud Giant)
This cloud giant has succumbed to its oversized ego and consorted with demonic powers to enhance its beauty and charisma. It now collects humanoids as a child collects toys, forcing them to bask in its presence as it plays with them in any way it sees fit. These captives are often kept in giant-sized doll houses and forced to carry out perverse acts for the giant’s amusement. Other times, it is the giant who puts on twisted performances, horrifying and enrapturing its captive audience.

### Hedonistic Satyr (Satyr)
This satyr’s wild antics have attracted the attention of a demonic lord of excess who has twisted the satyr’s passions into something far darker and more destructive. Hedonistic satyrs now turn their pursuits towards more sinister pleasures, always seeking some new depravity to top the last. Compassion and kinship have faded away, and they now only see others as a means to grant them pleasure and gratification.

> ___
> ***Complete Abandonment.*** At the start of the satyr's turn, if it has half its hit points or fewer, it goes Berserk* for one minute. While Berserk this way, any melee weapon attacks it makes that hit are critical hits, and all attacks that hit the satyr are also critical hits.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this ability triggers, it can't do so again until the creature finishes a short or long rest.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The satyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Obsessive Stalker.*** At the start of the satyr's turn, it can choose one other creature it can see within 120 feet of it to become Obsessed* with. While the satyr is Obsessed, its movement speed increases by 30 feet. All attacks of opportunity by the satyr against the target creature are made with advantage, and the target creature provokes opportunity attacks from the satyr even if it takes the Disengage action before leaving the satyr's reach. If the attack hits, the creature's speed becomes 0 for the rest of the turn.
> If the target creature tries to teleport, it also provokes an attack of opportunity from the satyr. If the attack hits, the satyr may choose to teleport along with the target creature to the nearest unoccupied space next to the creature where it appears. <br>
> The obsession lasts until the creature the satyr is Obsessed with dies or has not been seen by the satyr for over 1 minute.<Br>
> The satyr cannot use this feature if it is already Obsessed with a creature.
>
> ### Actions

### Fallen Unicorn (Unicorn)
This unicorn has fallen from grace and succumbed to pride and narcissism. It has become enamored with its own beauty and wishes to see that same obsessive admiration reflected in others. To achieve this, the fallen unicorn gathers a sycophantic cult of admirers who tend to its every desire. The admirers are made up of the fairest and most graceful individuals the unicorn can find, who it then brainwashes and incorporates into its cult of personality. Those who lose their luster over the years are brutally disposed of, ensuring that the unicorn’s “stable” of humanoids is made up of only the finest specimens.

### The Unicorn’s Lair

The unicorn’s lair is a grove of unearthly and beguiling beauty. The unicorn keeps it stocked with exquisite plants, animals, objects, and individuals who catch its fancy. Individuals who stumble upon the lair are rarely allowed to leave without first being broken into the unicorn’s service if it finds them attractive. Individuals it deems unattractive are ruthlessly disposed of for daring to defile the unicorn’s exquisite home with their presence.


This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 2. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the unicorn can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; the same effect can’t be used two rounds in a row:



##### Mesmerizing Mirror

The unicorn creates a cursed mirror in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 on the next turn. When a non-Creature of Excess creature first has line of sight of the mirror on its turn, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes mesmerized by the mirror, and all attacks have advantage against the creature while it has line of sight of the mirror, and it can't willingly move away from the mirror. Any creature that can't be charmed automatically succeeds on this saving throw.

##### Overwhelming Narcissism

The unicorn chooses a creature within the lair that it is aware of. The chosen creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become Obsessed* with itself. While Obsessed this way, the creature's speed becomes 0. It or another creature within reach of it uses an action to shake the creature out of obsession, allowing the target to make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

##### Dreadful Nightmare

The unicorn summons the image of a nightmarish version of itself in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 next turn. When a non-Creature of Excess creature first has line of sight of the image on its turn, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it.

## New Conditions Reference
Below are new conditions used throughout this document.

#### Berserk
The creature is consumed by bloodlust, giving it the following effects:
 * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear. 
* The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
* Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.

#### Dazed 
A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

#### Drowsy 
This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
* It moves at half speed.<br>
* It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
*  It can't concentrate. <br>
* Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
* The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

\columnbreak

#### Obsessed 
The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

#### Quickened
A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

#### Rampaging
The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
* On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
* The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
* Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
