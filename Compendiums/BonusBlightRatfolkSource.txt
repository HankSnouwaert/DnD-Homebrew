# Patron Bonus Blight Ratfolk


## Ratfolk Pussbugs
*Wretched Experiments & Living Bombs*<br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Individual

The Church of Decay subjects its ratfolk slaves—acquired through trade or the conquest of those who reject the path of ruin—to some of the most gruesome fates imaginable. These unfortunate thralls are handed over to the clergy, where they endure horrific experiments, serving as living test subjects for new toxic concoctions and virulent plagues. Their suffering is short-lived but agonizing, as most perish in excruciating torment.

However, when the church prepares for war, some of these wretched souls are transformed into living weapons known as pussbags. Their frail bodies are deliberately infected with specialized diseases, causing them to bloat grotesquely with gas as fluid-filled boils sprout from their flesh. These agonized creatures are then driven forward in a delirious haze, staggering toward the enemy.
The true horror of a pussbag lies in its gruesome demise. A single slash of a sword or the puncture of an arrow is enough to rupture its bloated form, triggering an eruption of rancid pus and infectious bile. Anyone unfortunate enough to be caught in the blast risks being drenched in the noxious fluids.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Even more horrifying is when these minions are administered with further inflections amid battle.  Priests and bishops of the faith will conjure fresh afflictions mid-battle, intentionally infecting a pussbag when it nears a cluster of foes. Already swollen with disease, the creature’s body rapidly distends beyond its limits before bursting in a violent explosion of rot. Worse still, such detonations can set off a horrific chain reaction—one pussbag’s eruption igniting another nearby, until the battlefield is swallowed in a choking cloud of filth and death.

### Pussbag Tactics
Pussbags start combat spread apart to avoid premature detonation. They only group up once they reach melee range, where an ally with necrotic damage can detonate them for maximum effect.

If the ratfolk took necrotic damage this turn, it deals 9 (2d8) necrotic damage instead.

While frightened this way, it can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. 
>
> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 2 (1d4) piercing damage.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Cornered Rat.*** When the ratfolk is reduced to 0 hit points and is frightened, it makes a bite attack against a creature within 5 feet of it with advantage, ignoring disadvantage from the frightened condition.

## Ratfolk Befoulers
*Foul Proselytizers & Keepers of Unholy Scripture*<br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Individual, Relics

To the malignant followers of the Church of Decay, no text is more sacred than the Book of Blight. Bound in mottled leather and inked with putrid bile, its foul pages contain the darkest secrets of pestilence and spells of plague, written by the vilest of Blight Bishops, malignant entities of rot, and even the great and cruel Vermin God himself. So corrupted is this tome that merely reading its loathsome passages can cause diseases to manifest from nothing, spreading like wildfire and infecting any unfortunate soul within earshot of the sermon.

The Book of Blight is such a potent source of decay that even its replicas carry vestiges of its unholy power. As if the tome itself were a living contagion longing to spread, many ambitious ratfolk seeking to climb the ranks of the church carry scrolls and volumes filled with its cursed verses. Charged with spreading its blighted doctrine, these ratfolk are known as befoulers. 

Among the most devoted of their kind, they wade through the masses of disciples and adversaries alike, clutching a cursed manuscript in one claw and a small blight censer in the other. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

As they bellow their poisonous doctrine, they rhythmically swing their censers, spewing noxious fumes that spill into the air.

This foul ritual cripples those in its vicinity, seizing their bodies with sickness and forcing them to stagger. However, those who embrace decay find themselves invigorated by fever, surging forward with deranged fervor, emboldened by the sickening ceremony. Yet many befoulers become victims of their own agitating ravings. As the delirium from their rite overtakes them, they preach with even greater zeal, their words summoning ever more potent afflictions. The cycle of corruption spirals out of control until their disease-ridden bodies can no longer withstand the horrors they have unleashed, and they collapse.

### Befouler Tactics
Befoulers charge into enemy ranks alongside their allies, aiming to be surrounded by as many creatures as possible. Creatures with Plague Disciple willingly fail the saving throw against its Rite of Pestilence. However, if a befouler’s health drops below one-third, they will try to resist the effect and scurry away.

## Ratfolk Lunatics
*Deranged Rats Lost To Feverish Delirium* <br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Individual, Relics

Within the ranks of the Church of Decay, most followers eventually succumb to the relentless plagues bestowed upon them, their bodies unable to withstand the overwhelming rot. However, in many cases, it is not the body that collapses first, but the mind. These disciples, ravaged by sickness, suffer a gradual erosion of sanity. Their afflictions lead to severe mental disorders, from uncontrollable twitching and incoherent rambling to obsessively picking at their own sores until they begin to ooze. Some become so deranged that even the most devoted members of the church find them unsettling—howling nonsensical hymns as they rip out their own fingernails or gnaw at rotting chunks of their own flesh while giggling hysterically.

The insidious clergy of Decay, ever opportunistic, put these acts of madness to use for their malignant goals. Those deemed Lunatics are restrained and isolated, kept alive but prevented from harming themselves or other members of the parish. When the church prepares for war, these infested maniacs are unshackled, handed rusted blades, and let loose upon the battlefield for all to witness.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

Even the most disciplined warriors recoil in horror as these pestilent wretches shamble toward them. Cackling and convulsing, they wield their filthy weapons not only against their enemies but upon themselves—gouging out growths from their own flesh, yanking rotten teeth from their mouths, and reveling in their own decay.

Yet the true horror is only revealed as battle rages on. When wounded—whether by an enemy’s strike or their own frenzied mutilations—the Lunatics’ madness intensifies. They eagerly tear out corroded organs from gaping wounds, hack away diseased flesh, and even sever their own limbs, all while howling with laughter. Hobbling forward, they slash at anything within reach, as if welcoming the inevitable end to their agonized existence.

### Lunatic Tactics
Lunatics lack much strategy. They always trigger their Disfigurement ability to activate Plague Disciple effects and will prioritize incapacitated enemies first.

## Plague Cauldrons

A brew of foul liquids and viscous mucus, Plague Cauldrons are sacred vessels from which the Church of Decay cultivates lethal pathogens for their twisted faith. Rare and revered, these ornate vats are rumored to be ancient artifacts stolen from the temples of a forgotten race, now corrupted in service to the Vermin God of Pestilence.

Many of the church’s rituals revolve around the cauldrons’ rancid contents, most acting as rites of passage for aspiring clergy. Participants must endure the foul fluid—whether by anointment, forced ingestion, or full immersion in a lethal baptism. Surviving this ordeal grants advancement, with some bishops enduring it multiple times. Yet even the devout can only withstand so much, and many eventually succumb to the very corruption they worship.

When a formidable adversary threatens the Church’s schemes, devoted plague monks haul these massive heirlooms from their festering shrines onto the battlefield. Under the watchful eye of a deacon, priest, or bishop, the priests chant over the sludge, stirring it until a pestilent wave erupts, eager for new hosts to infect.

The pathogens released vary wildly, each carrying its own horrific symptoms. Yet these plagues owe no loyalty, turning on both enemy and ally alike. Even those who unleash them are not always spared, often sharing the same grisly fate they inflict upon others.


### Plague Cauldron Mechanics

The plague cauldron is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the ark if it has both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 10 or higher. 

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat an plague cauldron with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

#### Unleashing the Pox

A creature attuned to the plague cauldron and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the pox within. The creature rolls on the Plague Symptom table below, then chooses one creature within 100 feet of the plague cauldron to infect. The infection then immediately spreads as follows:
* Each creature within 5 feet of the initially infected creature also becomes infected.
* The infection then spreads again from each of those creatures to any other creature within 5 feet of them.
* A creature can only be infected this way once per release of the pox.

Each infected creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage and becomes afflicted with a disease. While diseased, it has disadvantage on d20 tests using the associated ability from the Plague Symptom table.

If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it also suffers the Severe Symptom associated with the disease while infected.

\columnbreak

 A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t afflicted.
A diseased creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### Falling Into The Cauldron

Any creature within 5 feet of the plague cauldron may use its action to force a Large or smaller creature it has grappled into the cauldron. The creature in the cauldron rolls on the Plague Symptom table and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.

* On a failed save, the creature takes 28 (8d6) necrotic damage and becomes afflicted with a disease. While diseased, it has disadvantage on d20 tests using the associated ability from the Plague Symptom table.
* If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it also suffers the Severe Symptom associated with the disease while infected.
* On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t infected.

A diseased creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

##### Plague Symptom Table
| d6  |Ability  | Severe Symptom |
|:---:|:-----------|:-----------|
|  1  | **Wisdom.** | The creature can use its action, bonus action, and reaction to only take actions that allow it to make one or more attacks. |
|  2  | **Charisma.** |  Any attack that hits the creature scores a critical hit on a roll of 15-20 |
|  3  | **Constitution.** | The creature is has disadvantage on attack rolls and checks . |
|  4  | **Intelligence.** | The creature is dazed. (New condition described at end of document) |
|  5  | **Strength.** | The creature deals only half damage with attacks. |
|  6  | **Dexterity.** | The creature cannot benefit from the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Additionally, if the creature chooses to move more than 5 feet on its turn, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8.


### Plague Cauldron Tactics

The operator chooses plague effects that target the most vulnerable ability scores of the greatest amount of enemies.  For example, Dexterity-based effects work well against Dexterity-based attacks, while Constitution-based effects are ideal when fighting alongside plague ratfolk.

## Arch-Blightlord Nurgskritch
*Supreme Spiritual Ruler of The Church of Decay*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle, Swamp, Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Relics


Bloated with corruption and wielding the highest authority within the pitiless hierarchy of the Church of Decay, the obdurate Arch-Plaguelord Nurgskritch stands as a festering beacon of pestilence. Both his mind and body are equally hazardous, for the vile schemes and plagues he has devised have annihilated all who dared oppose his ascension—whether from within the church or beyond. His putrescent body harbors such calamitous pathogens that even his fellow foul priests and bishops find them perilous. His schemes are so insidious that entire kingdoms wither and collapse under the ravages of famine and disease, all without his involvement ever being detected.

Beyond his ruthless efficiency in eliminating his enemies, Nurgskritch's unwavering devotion to decay, combined with his hatred for anything that hinders its progression, fuels his religious tyranny. His fevered fanaticism is so powerful that it instills absolute obedience in his followers, compelling them to carry out his will without question.

Rarely does Nurgskritch engage in battle directly, preferring to let his devoted minions or his own lethal plagues exterminate those who displease him. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, on the rare occasion that his schemes fail to eliminate a target, the pestilent master takes up his Bubo-ridden blade and bubonic scepter, dealing a wretched end to any nettlesome individuals who have evaded death for too long. When he rides into battle, the Great Lord of Decay towers atop Bubo, his grotesquely overgrown and noisome rat, accompanied by his most trusted attendant, Byle. Byle wields a massive blight censer, swinging it with fevered passion, unleashing clouds of noxious filth upon the battlefield.

All the while, Nurgskritch calls upon the baleful power of the Pestilent God, causing the land itself to bloom with filth. The ground splits open like putrid flesh, releasing waves of tainting slime, massive throbbing boils, and malodorous vermin, all spreading festering death in their wake.

Even if one manages to withstand this nauseating onslaught of devoted minions and conjured plagues, they must then contend with the Unholy Figure himself. Fueled by unnatural strength and righteous indignation, each swing of his blade sinks deep into flesh, turning it to mulch as it cleaves through with rotting power.

### The Nurgskritch's Lair  

Nurgskritch's primary lair lies within the darkest reaches of a plague-ridden jungle, buried beneath its twisted roots, within the crumbling ruins of a once-mighty temple city, built by a race far more ancient than the ratfolk who now infest it. It was within this forsaken place that the Great Church of Decay was first founded by the ratfolk who stumbled upon its desolate remains.
However, Nurgskritch’s insidious designs have led him to construct secret strongholds deep underground in many lands. Wherever these bastions take root, they spread like tumors, seeping illness and corruption into the region.


When fighting within his lair, the Nurgskritch's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 1.  

#### Lair Actions  

When Nurgskritch rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or Nurgskritch dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 16 and acts of its own accord, always acting in Nurgskritch’s best interest. While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it.  

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair chooses a point within its boundaries. One of the following substances erupts in a 15-foot cube centered on that point, and creatures within suffer the corresponding effect. The lair cannot use the same substance two rounds in a row:  

- **Soul Feasting Blight.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or take 5 necrotic damage. Nurgskritch regains hit points equal to the total damage dealt this way.  

- **Sticky Pus.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure, their speed becomes 0 until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

- **Disruptive Fumes.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they cannot cast spells or maintain concentration until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

- **Slick Slime.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall prone and can't stand up until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

- **Sickening Sores.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they must use their next movement to travel away from the point where the effect originated. After doing so, they may take the rest of their turn as normal.  

#### Regional Effects  

The presence of the Nurgskritch drastically affects his surroundings, causing rot to run rampant within 10 miles of his lair:  

- Whenever a creature with the Plague Disciple trait scores a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it inflicts Nurgskritch’s Fever on the target.  
- Any wood in the area becomes covered in a thin coating of mold. Any creature without the Plague Disciple trait that touches this mold becomes inflicted with Nurgskritch’s Fever. The creature cannot be infected again in this way for the next minute.
- Any food or potions left in the area for more than 24 hours become tainted until removed from the region for the same duration. A creature without the Plague Disciple trait that eats or drinks the tainted substance contracts Nurgskritch’s Fever.  
- Whenever a creature without the Plague Disciple trait finishes a long rest in the area, it contracts Nurgskritch’s Fever.  

These effects gradually dissipate over 1d10 days after Nurgskritch’s death.  



### Nurgskritch's Fever  

Whenever an event causes a creature to contract Nurgskritch’s Fever, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it becomes infected with the disease at Severity Level 1. If already infected, its Severity Level increases by 1.  

##### Severity Effects  

| Severity Level | Effect |  
|:----:|:---------------------------------------------------|  
| **1** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d4 and subtracts the result. |  
| **2** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the result. |  
| **3** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d8 and subtracts the result. |  
| **4** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d10 and subtracts the result. |  
| **5** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d12 and subtracts the result. |  

#### Curing Nurgskritch's Fever  

A creature suffering from Nurgskritch’s Fever can attempt to cure itself through magic or healing abilities:  

- If a creature uses an ability that would end the Poisoned condition, it must first succeed on a DC 19 wisdom check. On a success, the Severity Level decreases by 1.  
- For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, the Severity Level decreases by an additional 1.  
- If the ability used to cure the disease is from a class with the Spellcasting feature, the caster adds their Spell Attack Modifier to the ability check.  
- If the creature is targeted by Heal or Mass Heal, the disease is instantly cured.  

After Nurgskritch’s death, a creature infected with Nurgskritch’s Fever reduces its Severity Level by 1 for each completed long rest.

Each creature infected by this plague makes a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and has disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attacks using the ability tied to that symptom until the end of Nurgskritch’s next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is no longer infected. If the creature fails by 10 or more, it also suffers the Severe Symptom for that ability until the end of Nurgskritch’s next turn.

> ***Overwhelming Mass.*** When Nurgskritch hits a creature with an attack, he deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage per ally he has within 5 feet of that target who isn’t incapacitated (up to three allies).
>
> ***Pestilent Blessing.*** When a creature makes a saving throw against a spell cast by Nurgskritch (including on himself), it can choose to fail. If it does so, Nurgskritch can have that creature use its reaction to move up to its speed and make one melee attack with advantage.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Spellcasting.*** Nurgskritch is a spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:
> - **At will:** *chill touch* (4d8), *thaumaturgy*  
> - **2nd level (4 slots):** *stream of corruption**  
> - **3rd level (4 slots):** *world sore**  
> - **4th level (4 slots):** *virulent decay**
>
> <br>***Blade of Nurgskritch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage, and the target becomes infected by Nurgskritch’s Plague.
>
> ___
> ### Monstrous Actions
> Nurgskritch gains two additional actions in combat: **Blighted Assault** and **Pestilent Birth**. He rolls initiative for each of these at the start of combat using his own initiative modifier. On the rolled initiative count (losing ties), Nurgskritch can take that action if he is not incapacitated. Instead of using either of these actions, he can use **Tenacious Will**, even if incapacitated.
>
> **Blighted Assault.** Nurgskritch or a creature he is mounted on can move up to 30 feet. During this movement, Nurgskritch can make two *Blade of Nurgskritch* attacks.
>
> **Pestilent Birth.** Nurgskritch creates three **Foul Spawn** (stat block on next page) in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of him. These **Foul Spawn** remain until destroyed or until Nurgskritch dies. They act on their own turns, immediately after this action’s initiative count. He can have up to three **Foul Spawn** at a time from this feature.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If Nurgskritch is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.
>
> **New spells described at the end of the document*

\pagebreakNum

##### Plague Symptom Table
| d6  |Ability  | Severe Symptom |
|:---:|:-----------|:-----------|

|  3  | **Constitution.** | The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and checks|
|  4  | **Intelligence.** | The creature is dazed. (New condition described at end of document) |
|  5  | **Strength.** | The creature deals only half damage with attacks. |
|  6  | **Dexterity.** | The creature cannot benefit from the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Additionally, if the creature chooses to move more than 5 feet on its turn, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8.

### Nurgskritch's Tactics
Nurgskritch's main goal in combat is to spread his plague to as many targets as possible.

#### Normal Turn Sequence
Nurgskritch casts the following spells in order of priority:

* **Virulent Decay**
    * Cast when it can affect three or more enemies.
    * Upcast to 5th level if it will hit more targets.
    * Can use his own allies to bridge gaps between enemies.<br>
<br>  
* **World Sore**
    * Placed in the center of an enemy group or in key locations to deter movement.
    * Follow-up: Cast Chill Touch, or if the boil can hit four or more enemies, detonate it immediately.
    * On subsequent turns, minions will detonate the boil if it affects two or more targets.<br>
<br>
* **Stream of Corruption**
    * Targets as many creatures as possible.
    * Effective for hitting both enemies and Nurgskritch’s own minions.<br>
    
\columnbreak

* **Blighted Assault**
    * Focuses on infecting as many targets as possible, prioritizing enemies with low AC.<br>
<br>
* **Pestilent Birth**
    * Summons minions next to ranged attackers.
    * Minions stay grouped to benefit from Overwhelming Mass and can be affected by Nurgskritch’s spells.

#### Lair Actions
* Nurgskritch is highly intelligent and wise, allowing him to predict his opponents' weakest saving throws.
* He selects lair actions based on the largest enemy group, choosing a saving throw type they are least likely to succeed against.
* If his plague causes disadvantage on a particular saving throw, he will favor lair actions that exploit this weakness.

#### Allies
**Billios.** Targets large enemy groups to maximize damage.
**Bubo.** Functions as an independent mount for Nurgskritch that attacks targets that will give it the benefits of Overwhelming Mass. Bubo can still move with Nurgskritch when he uses Blighted Assault.

## New Conditions


### Rampaging
While rampaging, the creature is subject to the following effects:
 - Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
 - On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see within reach. After making its attacks, it can’t move for the rest of its turn.
 - If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it moves toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest available route until it is within range to attack. If it reaches a target, it immediately makes an attack and can’t move for the rest of its turn.
 - If the creature still isn’t within reach of a hostile creature after moving, it must take the Dash action and continue moving toward the nearest hostile creature.
 - The creature can’t cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.


### Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.


### Quickened
A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

## New Spells

#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___


Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.

\columnbreak

#### World Sore
*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You cause a festering boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see. The boil is a Medium object, and the surface must be wide enough to accommodate its size. When the spell ends, the boil shrivels and disappears.

The boil has AC 10, 30 hit points, immunity to psychic, poison, and necrotic damage, and vulnerability to piercing and slashing damage. It cannot regain hit points.

When the boil is reduced to 0 hit points, it bursts in a spray of toxic pus, creating a 20-foot-radius emanation centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The spell then ends.

At the start of each of your turns, while the spell is active, the boil swells with more pus, the damage it deals increases by 1d12, and it takes 3d6 force damage as it strains under its own pressure.

You can use your action to rupture the boil, reducing it to 0 hit points.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The hit points of the boil are increased by 10, and the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3.


#### Virulent Decay
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

You unleash a bolt of decay toward a creature you can see within range, infecting it with necrotic energy. The infection can then spread to another creature of your choice within 5 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 5 feet of that one. This process repeats one more time. A creature can only be infected once by this spell.

Each infected creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10, and the infection can jump one additional time for each spell slot level above 4.
