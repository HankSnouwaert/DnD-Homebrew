# Bonus Empire War Machines

## Blackpowder Volley Guns
Volley guns unleash a barrage of leaden death on anything caught in their lethal stream of projectiles. This massive, wheeled firearm, its multiple barrels arranged in a rotating cylinder, features a hand-crank at the rear. One sharp turn of the crank spins the cylinder; as each loaded barrel swings to the top, a match or flint ignites the charge and lets loose a bullet. Cranked with haste, the gun roars out a broadside equal to an entire regiment of musketeers. In seconds, these iron reapers shred even the toughest foes.

Yet for all their ingenuity, volley guns remain fragile machines. The crank often jams under prolonged fire. Overheated barrels can crack, venting flames and shards of iron. In the worst cases, a misfire triggers a chain reaction: gunpowder ignites prematurely, the cylinder ruptures, and the entire gun erupts in a tidal wave of shrapnel and fire, swallowing crew and enemy alike.

### Thunder Hymn Volley Gun

On occasion, master engineers have collaborated with wizards versed in celestial lore, who can summon every manner of foul weather. From such rare partnerships emerges the Thunder Hymn Volley Gun.

Even at rest, the weapon betrays its enchantment: the barrels tremble with a faint vibration and emit a low, ceaseless hum, as though the sky itself whispers within the steel.

Most uncanny of all, the gun spurns black powder entirely. Its cylinders accept only hollow crystalline bullets: slender beads of glass that require no propellant. When the crank is turned, a gale of air roars into the chambers, ushering the mystical ammunition forward.

On impact, the bead bursts. Thunder, caged inside, erupts. The blast is sufficient to slay a man outright and fling his corpse backward.

Such weapons, though, are no safer than their mundane counterparts. Many of these marvels have been lost when the ammunition breaks prematurely, and a cascade of metal-shredding sonic waves obliterates all in the vicinity.

| 5-6 | Detonated | The gun explodes and is destroyed. Each creature in a 15-foot emanation must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 14. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 14 (4d6) Piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) Fire damage if it is a Blackpowder Volley Gun or 22 (4d10) Thunder damage if it is a Thunder Hymn Volley Gun. <br>  *Success:* Half damage. | None

<br>

### Volley Gun Tactics

Volley guns are aimed at the enemy with the lowest Dexterity.

Most operators crank the weapon three times only; a desperate or reckless gunner may crank it as many times as possible.

Thunder hymn volley guns will prefer to target creatures with low Dexterity that rely on melee attacks.

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.



## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

\columnbreak

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.


#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps Table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Landships

The secrets behind manufacturing the great mechanical weapons of war wielded by the world’s mightiest empires are among their most jealously guarded treasures. The steam tank stands as the pinnacle of such ingenuity, an iron behemoth able to barrel headlong into the front lines, shrugging off every counter-attack while unleashing relentless cannon fire. This raw puissance has captivated countless organizations eager to replicate the Imperial machine. Yet it is the great merchant guilds that have most assiduously sought to make a copy of their own.

The prospect of a single tank protecting the guilds’ interests rather than an entire squadron of costly mercenaries has lodged itself firmly in their avaricious minds. No amount of reasoning can dislodge the dream of such savings. Mountains of gold were poured into the effort; dozens of engineers were hired to forge a weapon rivaling the empire’s creation. Months dragged on, yielding only prototypes that crumbled under testing or workshops obliterated by unstable engines vainly chasing the steam tank’s efficiency and power. Expenses and casualties mounted relentlessly.

Many surviving engineers fled, convinced the task was impossible. Only the foolhardy and deranged remained, tasked with delivering what had been promised to merchant lords who now seethed at the spiralling costs. In frantic, preposterous deliberations, the madmen concluded they could never match the steam tank’s elegant efficiency. Their outlandish solution: build a vastly larger version, so the engines need not be so refined. To cut costs and lend majesty, they repurposed old guild trade ships, grafting hulls onto land-bound frames.

In a shockingly short time, the anomalous “land ship” was unveiled to its patrons. Perhaps clinging to the denial that their coffers had been bled for sub-par results, the merchant lords declared the project a triumph and demanded an entire fleet be built at once.

These overpriced colossi are no mere curiosities. They stride across battlefields at express pace, carrying entire regiments inside, soldiers granted perfect vantage points behind ample cover to rain fire on foes. Like any warship at sea, the land boats bristle with siege artillery capable of tearing through adversaries. Yet their most lethal trait is a hazard to friend and foe alike. Despite their gargantuan size, the engines remain unreliable. A single powerful, well-placed blow can overheat the boilers, triggering catastrophe: the ship lurches forward uncontrollably, shattering into a broken heap, or the boilers explode with devastating force, leaving only splintered wood and billowing clouds of scalding steam.

### Onyx Landships

There are a rare few of these enormous vessels that have been infused with enchantments of death by a grim arc-wizard of the highest order. Such ships are foreboding figures: winds howl mournfully around them, portents of the tragedy to come.  It is said their sails, woven of deepest onyx thread and strung upon towering masts, can be adjusted to summon a horrid gale that tears away hope from any caught in its wake.

Any crushed beneath the treads of the moving juggernaut have their essences extracted and imbued into the pilot, granting unnatural resilience. Crews that man these vessels are solemn figures, the mirth of life eroded by prolonged exposure to the dark magics permeating every timber and rivet.

Much mystery surrounds the few onyx ships that exist, for they are rarely seen. Some say the merchant guilds paid the great wizard to enhance the combat capabilities of their favored weapons, only to regret the bargain, locking the cursed things away in their most secure warehouses, retrieving them only in the direst circumstances. Others claim the ships were sold to the spellcaster for an exorbitant sum and now serve the mysterious figure himself.



### Adding Siege Weapons To Landships
If you are using the rules for Siege Weapons, you may build one or more into a landship. These siege weapons share the landship's hit points, AC, and damage threshold, and are destroyed when the landship is destroyed. These weapons have their own action station that provides three-quarters cover to the operators. Any member in the action station can Load, Prep, or Fire the Siege Weapon. The weapons cannot be used if the landship is Prone.

If the weapon would suffer a Mishap, the landship instead suffers the Mishap, using its normal Mishap Table.

The landship's CR is increased by the CR of the Siege Weapon built into it.

### Iron Musketeers

Within the great empires stand elite academies dedicated to crafting black-powder firearms and forging soldiers into masters of their lethal trade. Young marksmen from across the land flock to these schools, dreaming of enrollment and mastery. Scores are turned away; the few who remain endure brutal, unforgiving training. Those who survive are dubbed Iron Musketeers and armed with the finest weapons the institutions can forge.

These graduates are a terror on any battlefield. They reload flintlocks at breakneck speed and land skull-shattering shots with chilling precision. A rare handful are entrusted with handheld grenade launchers, lobbing explosives with such skill that no enemy near the blast can escape the storm of shrapnel.

### Onyx Musketeers

Some iron musketeers possess not only peerless marksmanship but a cold, unflinching resolve amid the carnage they unleash. These grim warriors may be judged worthy to ascend as Onyx Musketeer. They are given muskets fashioned by spellcasters who have studied the winds of death, are engraved with macabre symbols of power, and loaded with black powder laced with grave dust; the lead balls are recast from metal pried from the wounds of the dead.

When mystic arms are fired, the bullets faintly burn with a ghastly purple glow. Where they lodge in flesh and bone, the tissue withers, weakens, and crumbles to dust at a touch. Only the most detached and aloof of soldiers can inflict such a fate upon another soul and remain untormented by the act.

### Landship Tactics

Landships can vary greatly in their tactics depending on the type of artillery they have built into them and the soldiers they carry.

However, landships are best utilized when they can leverage their speed to circle around opponents, allowing their artillery and passengers to pelt enemies from a distance with ranged attacks while having cover. The ship should charge in to finish off weaker opponents before retreating to a safe distance again.

Iron musketeers work well with landships, as they can maintain their Black Powder Discipline while still being transported by the ship.

#### Onyx Landship
Onyx landships should use their Sails of Doom on targets they intend to follow up with artillery, particularly those that would normally have a high saving throw against such weapons. If the target also fails its save, they can then charge the target as well.

#### Iron Musketeers
Musketeers are able to stay at a distance and deliver devastating blows with their muskets. They should be guarded by melee troops or ride on top of vehicles to keep them safe.

### Landship Encounters
The following are suggestions for encounters you can build using different  types of landshipts for player groups of different levels:

| Player Group          | Recommended Encounter |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Group of 4 level 14 players | Landship with Blackpowder Volley Gun attached and 8 Iron Musketeers riding inside it.<br><br> |
| Group of 4 level 18 players | Onyx Landship with Thunder Hymn Volley Gun attached and 8 Onyx Iron Musketeers riding inside it. |

## Steam Tanks

Steam tanks are massive metallic war machines that thunder across the battlefield. A small team of engineers tends the pressurized boilers that grant these mechanical terrors the power to decimate anything in their path. They grind opposition beneath heavy treads, scald foes with waves of flesh-searing mist, and hurl iron cannonballs, not by gunpowder, but by the explosive force of superheated steam, tearing apart enemy formations from afar.

Thick metal plating renders the tank nearly invulnerable; longbows and greatswords wielded by even the mightiest warriors bounce harmlessly off its armored hide. Yet for all their might, steam tanks are temperamental and unstable. It is not uncommon for components to fail, rendering the machine inoperable or worse, for internal pipes to rupture, flooding the cramped interior with boiling vapor and cooking the crew alive. The most catastrophic failures turn the entire tank into a titanic bomb: when the boiler finally bursts, the explosion is violent enough to shred the vehicle and obliterate everything in the surrounding area.

### The Emperor's Wrath
A marvel of engineering whose secrets died with its creator, the Emperor’s Wrath stands as the unrivaled pinnacle of steam-tank technology.

Long ago, in an era when the Empire tore itself apart in civil war, a brilliant and audacious young engineer was recruited by an ambitious great count who dreamed of seizing the throne. Granted unlimited resources, the engineer first devised the earliest steam tanks and built several to bolster his patron’s armies. Yet his ambition did not stop there. Through relentless experimentation, he perfected a far more powerful engine, one that allowed the armored behemoth to move at terrifying speed while unleashing devastating barrages of scalding steam and iron shot as it rampaged across the battlefield.

Tragically, shortly after this breakthrough, the genius perished in an experiment gone catastrophically wrong. No blueprints were ever committed to paper, whether through oversight or deliberate intent to ensure no rival could surpass him remains unknown.

Today, the sole surviving example of this ultimate design is the most treasured relic of the entire Empire. Heavily guarded by the Imperial Army, it is known simply as the Emperor’s Wrath. The machine is deployed only in the most desperate battles, when the very survival of the realm hangs in the balance.

To this day, dozens of master engineers have tried, and failed, to decipher the intricate workings of its miraculous engine. Meanwhile, rival nations watch with envious eyes, scheming to steal the one-of-a-kind weapon and shift the balance of power forever.

### Steam Tank Encounters
The following are suggestions for encounters you can build using different  types of steam tanks for player groups of different levels:

| Player Group          | Suggested Encounter |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Group of 4 level 13 players | **Steam Tank** with 3 **Imperial Vehicle Operators** and an** Apprentice Engineer*** riding inside it.<br><br> |
| Group of 4 level 17 players | The **Emperor's Wrath** with 3 **Imperial Vehicle Operators** and a **Master Engineer*** riding inside it. |


###  Steam Tank Tactics
Steam tanks are mobile fortresses that can deliver deadly artillery while also crushing foes in melee.

A steam tank will start by bombarding opponents with its steam cannon from a distance, generating 3 steam points to minimize any mishaps. Once a foe closes in, it will generate 6 steam points and use its steam gun to damage oncoming foes and then charge into another group of vulnerable enemies.

### Emperor's Wrath Tactics
The Emperor's Wrath can generate steam points safely, and the fact that it can deal damage to creatures nearby with its Building Pressure trait means the tank will move just out of melee range and bombard enemies while keeping them within range of Building Pressure. The crew will allow up to three levels of Instability to accumulate before they attempt to remove them.

# Self-Propelled Vehicles
Most land vehicles in fantasy settings are pulled by other creatures, such as wagons, carriages, or chariots. However, through some combination of technology or magic, some vehicles may be self-propelled and driven by a passenger. These may be relatively small mechanical contraptions, magically self-propelled carriages, or mighty war machines rumbling across blasted battlefields. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these vehicle types in your games. They can be applied to vehicles of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own vehicles. The rules here can be applied to most self-powered vehicles piloted by a passenger. 

At the end of the document, you'll find a couple of example vehicles that can be used as inspiration for coming up with your own designs.

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Rules
Self-propelled vehicles are vehicles able to move without needing to be pushed or pulled by another creature, and they usually don’t need an external energy source (such as wind). Throughout this document, they will be referred to simply as vehicles. Creatures within a vehicle are referred to as passengers. 
In combat, vehicles use most of the same rules as creatures, with the following additional considerations:

### Opportunity Attacks
Vehicles provoke opportunity attacks as usual. When a vehicle provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle itself or any creature riding on or inside it, provided they are within reach and do not have total cover.


### Spacing Within Vehicles
All creatures within a vehicle count as being within 5 feet of each other.


### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Entering or exiting the vehicle costs a creature half of its movement. Each creature inside the vehicle may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting.


### Crashing into Creatures and Objects
A vehicle can crash into a creature or object by entering its space. When it does, the creature or object must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice) using the vehicle's DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved in a straight line before attempting to enter the target's space (maximum 20d6 damage).

\columnbreak

If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage and is not knocked prone. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the vehicle's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. A target can only make this saving throw once per turn.

If the vehicle is at least two size categories larger than the target it crashed into, it can continue moving through the target's space if it has any movement remaining. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop. If the target is an impassable object that could reasonably damage the vehicle, such as an iron wall, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6 damage). Each creature on or inside the vehicle takes the damage as well

### Prone Vehicles
If vehicle falls prone, it cannot right itself and is incapacitated until it is flipped upright.

### Falling Vehicles
When a vehicle falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position. If the vehicle falls due to the actions of its driver (such as jumping off a ramp) it may not land prone (DM’s discretion) but still takes fall damage.



### Repairing Vehicles
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
Certain circumstances can cause a vehicle to malfunction and eventually break down due to wear and tear. This wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion rules, as described in Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with the following modifications:

* When a vehicle reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
* The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a vehicle is through repair. This can be done using the rules described in the Repairing Vehicles section above. If the attempt to repair the vehicle succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle's exhaustion level remains unchanged, but the repair attempt can be made again using <br> the same tools and replacement parts.

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these vehicles have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A vehicle's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a vehicle's hit points reach 0, it becomes inoperative and is irreparably damaged.
### Damage Threshold
Most vehicles possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A vehicle with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the vehicle takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the vehicle's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the vehicle's hit points.

### Mishap Threshold
When a vehicle sustains damage from a single source that is equal to or exceeds its mishap threshold, it is required to roll on the Mishaps table (refer to the Mishaps section).


### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the vehicle comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the vehicle.

### Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity indicates the maximum weight of cargo the vehicle can carry.

### Vehicle DC 
Whenever the vehicle requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ability Scores 
A vehicle possesses the standard six ability scores that creatures have, along with their corresponding modifiers. The Strength of the vehicle is determined by its size and weight, while Dexterity represents its handling and maneuverability. The Constitution of a vehicle reflects its durability and quality of construction. In most cases, vehicles have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.



\columnbreak

If a vehicle has a score of 0 in a particular ability score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that relies on that score.

### Action Stations
A vehicle may have one or more Action Stations. Each of these stations requires a certain number of creatures to operate and may grant those creatures some amount of cover. The creatures operating these stations must be passengers within the vehicle, but not all passengers need to be operating a station. A creature operating a station <br> can use an action to activate the station's effect.  <br> A station can be occupied by only one <br> creature at a time and can only <br> be activated once per round. 



#### The Helm 
Most vehicles that must be piloted by a passenger (referred to as the driver) have an Action Station known as the Helm, where the vehicle's movement is controlled. It usually consists of a chair equipped with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. If a vehicle has a helm with no one operating it, it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver who is proficient with land vehicles can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

The driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring it to a complete stop. While the vehicle is in motion, the driver can steer it along any desired course. If the driver becomes incapacitated, leaves the helm, or takes no action to alter the vehicle's course and speed, the vehicle will continue moving in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it collides with an obstacle large enough to stop its movement.


### Mishaps
Most vehicles have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways its functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishaps Table. 

To resolve a Mishap, a creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (refer to the Mishaps section). If the vehicle is moving, the check is made with disadvantage. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for the repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.
