# New Rope Mechanics & Weapons
This document features a collection of content to help you better utilize rope and add more rope-based weapon options into your games. While rope may seem trivial, it is one of the more common adventuring items players often have with them, and there aren't many core 5e rules that detail how to make use of them in combat situations. The following mechanics will give you consistent and concise guidelines for interactions with rope and can be used for any other materials with rope-like properties (such as chains or spider silk).

## New Rope Mechanics
The following mechanics can be used whenever two creatures are holding/attached to a rope and pulling against each other. This could involve a player lassoing a wild animal, someone in chains trying to escape guardsmen who are trying to yank them back by said chains, or a literal tug-of-war between two creatures, each holding a rope.

### Tug of War Contests
A tug-of-war contest is a special type of opposed Strength check between two creatures on either end of a rope.

While you're holding or tethered to a rope that is also held by or tethered to another creature no more than one size larger than you, you can use the Attack action to make an opposed Strength check against the other creature to try to pull the rope towards yourself. 

\columnbreak

If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. 

If you are more than one size larger than the opposing creature, you automatically win this contest. If the results of both checks are higher than the rope's break DC, the rope snaps.

If you win the contest and the rope doesn't snap, you can pull the rope along with you as you move or pull it towards yourself while standing still. If the opposing creature doesn't drop the rope or is tethered to it, it will be pulled along as though you are grappling it. 

You can't engage in a tug-of-war contest using a hand that is holding other objects (including other ropes).

#### New Condition: Tethered
If a creature is attached to a rope (such as via a lasso, harpoon, or a secure tie), it is tethered to that rope. Creatures immune to the grappled condition can't be tethered. 

Any creature that succeeds in a tug-of-war contest against a tethered creature using the attached rope is considered to be grappling it. The tethered creature can end the grapple by untethering itself, breaking the rope, or winning another tug-of-war contest against the grappling creature.

## Harpoons
The following content can <br> be used to add harpoon <br> weaponry to your game world. <br> The Harpoon Master feat can <br> help players specialize in using <br> these weapons, and the statistics <br> for the Rope Qualities can be used <br> to upgrade the reliability of harpoon <br> tethers and net weapons.

### Harpoon Weapons 
#### Harpoon Gun
*ranged weapon (martial, crossbow)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Ammunition (range 30/120), harpoon, loading, special
- **Cost:** 90 gp, ammo: 2gp (1gp for the bolt, 1gp for the rope)
- **Weight:** 4 lb
___

#### Harpoon Spear
*melee weapon (martial, spear)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** harpoon, thrown (range 20/60), special, versatile (1d8)
- **Cost:** 2 gp (1gp for the spear, 1gp for the rope)
- **Weight:** 4 lb
___




##### Harpoons

All harpoon spears and ammunition are attached to a harpoon rope. By default, harpoon ropes have 10 AC, a Break DC of 12, and can be cut with 5 damage.

**Tethering The Target.** When you hit a creature or object with a harpoon attack, it is tethered to the harpoon's rope. If you miss, the target isn't tethered, and you can use the rope to pull the harpoon back to yourself as an object interaction. 
When you tether a creature this way, you may immediately make a tug-of-war contest against it (no action required.)

**Removing The Harpoon.** Any creature that can reach the harpoon can use an action to remove it, thus ending the tethered condition. Doing so deals an additional 1d6 weapon damage to the tethered creature.

**Replacing Harpoon Ropes.** If you recover a harpoon spear or a harpoon gun bolt with a snapped rope, you can replace the rope over 10 minutes, using 1gp worth of rope and other supplies. This can be done over the course of a short or long rest, replacing up to 10 harpoon ropes during a short rest and up to 20 during a long rest.

### Feat: Harpoon Master 
You've learned how to use harpoons to maximum effect in combat. 
When you take this feat, you gain the following benefits.
* Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Creatures you've hit with harpoons have their speed reduced by 15 feet until they've removed the harpoon.
* If a creature is concentrating on a spell and ends its turn while impaled by a harpoon you hit it with, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

### Rope Quality for Nets & Harpoons 

Players can gain access to higher-quality rope for nets and harpoon tethers by paying more gold. The following table describes the gp cost for each level of quality. Each table row can be used to describe a net or the rope and supplies needed to attach a tether to a harpoon. In the case of nets, the gp cost describes the overall cost of the net. In the case of harpoon spears and gun bolts, the gp cost describes the added cost of upgrading the item's quality, which can also be done when replacing a snapped tether.  

##### Rope Qualities 
|Cost  | Break DC <br> (Harpoon) | Break DC <br> (Net)  | Rope AC | Cumulative <br> Damage to Cut |
|:---:|:----:|:----:|:--:|:--:|
| 1gp | 12 | 10  | 10 | 5
| 50gp|  15 | 13  | 13 | 10
| 200gp| 18 | 16  | 16 | 15

**Tethering Nets.** You can add a rope tether to a net, which doubles the cost of the net. When you hit a creature with a tethered net, you may tether your target the same way you tether with a harpoon. The tether has the same DC to snap, AC to hit, and damage needed to break as the net it's attached to, and a creature that breaks free of the net is no longer bound by the tether.

## Magic Nets & Harpoons


### Magic Harpoon Spears

#### Battle Anchor 
*Harpoon spear, rare*

Only the mightiest of nautical warriors can wield this massive anchor. This weapon has the heavy and two handed properties, its attacks deal 2d6 piercing damage, and creatures wielding it must have a Strength of 14 or higher to make attacks with it without disadvantage. 

When you strike a creature with the anchor, you can choose not to tether it and instead deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing. If a creature dealt bludgeoning damage this way is Huge or smaller, it is knocked back 10 feet. 

Additionally, a Huge or smaller creature tethered by the anchor moves at half its speed. 

#### Combat Angler's Fishing Rod
*Harpoon spear, rare*

This weapon takes the form of an enchanted fishing pole. As an action, you can add rope to the pole, which then automatically creates a fishing hook at the end.

This weapon functions like a normal harpoon spear with the following exceptions:
* Ranged attacks made with this weapon are made by throwing the fishing hook out at targets rather than throwing the weapon itself, though it can still only tether one target at a time and can't be used to make attacks while it is tethering a target.


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


* The distances for ranged attacks made with this weapon increase to 60/200. 
* Melee attacks made with this weapon deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing and cannot tether targets.  
* Whenever a creature you can see makes a bite attack, you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it with this weapon. If this attack hits, the creature has disadvantage on the bite attack. You cannot make this attack if you already have a creature tethered with the pole.

#### Electro-Harpoon
*Harpoon spear, very rare (requires attunement)*

This harpoon contains a magical apparatus capable of electrifying it and its tether. As an action, you can electrify the tether between yourself and a harpooned target. Each creature directly between you and the harpoon must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity save or take 4d6 lightning damage. The tethered target automatically fails this save.

style='position:absolute;top:-255px;left:-200px;width:1300px;transform:rotate(-5deg)' />






\pagebreak

#### Threading Needle
*Harpoon spear, rare*

This giant magical sewing needle is said to have been crafted by eccentric fey lords. When you tether a creature with this weapon, the needle pierces through the target, and if you have a free hand, you may have it automatically fly back to that hand while keeping a hold of the tethering thread. 

Holding the tether still occupies one of your hands. However, you can tether additional creatures with this needle, and each tether made with the needle can be maintained with the same hand. The needle deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage per creature it is tethering. 

Each tethered creature must still stay within 60 feet of you to maintain the tether. If a tethered creature succeeds on a tug-of-war check to pull you by the tether, rather than pull you or snap the tether, it magically moves through the thread and frees itself. 

If the tether is cut, each tethered creature is freed. You may use an action to reapply a rope to the needle, which turns the rope into more magical thread.

\columnbreak





#### Underworld Skewers
*Harpoon spear, rare (requires attunement)*

These ghastly harpoons are said to be forged in the underworld and made for hunting wayward spirits. The harpoons come in a set of 10 that are all bound to a quiver. To attune to them, you must be in possession of the quiver, and while attuned, you can use an action to cause all the harpoons to reappear in their quiver.

These harpoons can tether incorporeal creatures normally immune to the grappled condition, and the tethers attached to these harpoons take on a ghostly quality and cannot be cut, though they can still be snapped through Strength checks. 

While one or more of these harpoons are impaled in any creatures within 60 feet of you, you may use an action to call all the harpoons back, causing them to rip themselves free and deal their weapon damage to the creatures they were impaling before flying back to their quiver. The harpoons phase through all obstacles to reach their quiver.


### Magic Harpoon Guns

#### Self-Reeling Harpoon Gun
*Harpoon gun, uncommon (+1, +2, or +3 Str Mod), rare (+4 Str Mod), or very rare (+5 Str Mod)*

The harpoon gun contains a magical pully system that reels in tethered targets at the wielder's command. When you make a tug-of-war check against a creature tethered with this weapon, you can apply the weapon's modifier rather than your Strength modifier to the check. The value of the weapon's modifier depends on its rarity.

### Magic Nets
Unless stated otherwise, a net loses its magical properties once a creature it has entangled is freed from it.

#### Anti-Magic Net
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), legendary (DC 19)*

A creature hit by this net must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on any ongoing spells and be unable to cast spells until the start of its next turn. At the start of each turn that it is restrained by the net, the creature must succeed on the same saving throw or be subjected to the effects again until the start of its next turn. The DC of this Concentration save is determined by the rarity of the net.


#### Electro-Net
*Net, common (1d6), uncommon (3d6), rare(5d6), very rare(8d6), legendary (12d6)*

Creatures restrained by this net take lighting damage at the start of each of their turns and can't take reactions. The amount of lighting damage they take is determined by the rarity of the net.

#### Ghost Net
*Net, rare*

This net can restrain incorporeal creatures normally immune to the restrained condition. Creatures restrained by the net cannot planeshift to the Ethereal Plane or benefit from invisibility. 

#### Shadow Net
*Net, rare*

Creatures restrained by this net are blinded unless they have the ability to see through magical darkness as cloying shadows cover their eyes.


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Mega Net
*Net, rare*

When you throw this net, you target a point within its range. As it lands, the net magically expands either 5 or 10 feet (your choice) outwards in all directions from that point. Make an attack roll with the net against each creature completely within that area. On a hit, that creature is restrained by the net. 

Huge creatures can be restrained by the net, but Gargantuan creatures are immune.

If one of the creatures restrained by the net is moved, all other creatures in the net are moved with it. However, no effect can move a creature within the net unless it can move all the creatures in the net.

Each creature must cut or break its way free of the net individually. The net doesn't lose its magical properties until each creature it has restrained is freed from it.

#### Toxic Net
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), or legendary (DC 19)*

These nets are woven with vines that release poisonous aerosols when destroyed. If the net is snapped or destroyed with slashing damage, each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Consitution saving throw, with the DC determined by the net's rarity. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. 

A creature poisoned this way can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

The net doesn't lose its magical properties until it is destroyed this way.
