# Tomb Kingdom Compilation

This document contains a compilation of ancient Egyptian-inspired undead and construct creatures that you can use to represent the undying forces of a long-lost tomb kingdom. These forces range from lowly skeletal soldiers to towering spirit-powered statues and tyrannical tomb kings.

## Tomb Kingdoms Infantry

Deep within ancient tombs and buried under sandy dunes lie forgotten legions whose loyalty to their bygone kingdoms and undying lords transcends death. These soldiers swore to continue their service into the afterlife and died with their weapons and armor in hand to ensure they would always be ready to answer the call of their eternal lords.

When the undying priests and monarchs of antiquity make war, they summon these regiments of unbreakable undead warriors who tirelessly carry out the orders of their superiors. These skeletal soldiers have forgotten most of their former identities, retaining only their training and their sense of unwavering duty. In battle, they execute the commands of their superiors with flawless devotion, never flinching in the face of danger as they carry out their eternal service.

### Skeletal Infantry
These undead represent the most numerous and lowest-ranking soldiers of the tomb king armies. They were given only the most rudimentary of burial rites, resulting in almost none of their former personality surviving. They possess only the knowledge and skills needed to serve as efficient and loyal soldiers. Though they cannot speak, they can understand and carry out orders with flawless efficiency. Each skeletal regiment retains the years of training and experience with its weapons and combat role that it had in life, and the long years have not dulled their skills.

#### Skeletal Spearmen
These soldiers make up the backbone of most tomb king armies. They march in seemingly endless ranks of bone and bronze, wielding ancient spears and impaling every foe before them. Though they are not the most powerful soldiers, they make up for this with numbers and unshakable resolve. Skeletal spearmen will fight against even the most overwhelming odds, never fleeing and fighting to the last soldier. 

##### The Scorpion Legion
The spearmen of this notorious legion are known for crafting their spears from the tails of deadly desert scorpions. These skeletal soldiers wield their venomous weapons with brutal skill, and foes that survive the initial stab will often succumb to the poisonous aftereffects. 

#### Skeletal Archers
These warriors served as the ranged support to their ancient armies. Armed with bows and an ever-ready supply of bronze-tipped arrows, these archers rained death on their foes to wound and demoralize armies before they could even engage in melee combat. In death, these archers continue to fulfill their ancient role, unleashing streams of arrows with no thought other than to carry out the orders of their eternal masters.

##### The Hawk Legion
These renowned archers were not only expertly trained soldiers but devoted disciples of the hawk god, whose domains were discernment and the hunt. In exchange for their devotion, the hawk god granted them his heightened senses and blessed their arrows such that they would unerringly find their quarry, regardless of any obstacle.

### Tomb Warriors
In life, these soldiers were among the most fanatically loyal to their monarch. These warriors eschewed the protection of a shield and spear, instead duel-wielding curved blades known as khopeshes to maximize their killing potential. Their khopesh blades allow them to knock weapons out of their foes’ grips, potentially sending them flying out of reach. These warriors then ruthlessly cut down their defenseless victims before continuing their bloody rampage. Tomb warriors have lost none of their fervor in death and continue to charge headlong into battle, headless of any danger.

#### Netherworld Legion
When mortals died and passed into the afterlife, it was said their souls would be judged by the discerning gaze of the god of the underworld. Those who displeased this god or were found unworthy would be cast down to the netherworld to suffer for eternity. However, some warriors could bargain for a better fate by offering their service as enforcers of their god’s will in the mortal realm. 

This netherworld legion of warriors can be summoned by those who curry favor with the god of the underworld. Even in the land of the living, they are spectral warriors who flicker in and out of the Material Plane. Their otherworldly nature can even transfer into objects they disarm from foes, preventing their retrieval. And when these warriors are defeated and banished back to the netherworld, they can leave a lingering curse that partially unmoors mortals from the Material Plane.

> ***Curse of the Netherworld.*** When the skeleton dies, it curses each non-undead creature within 10 feet of it, forcing each of those creatures to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail) or be cursed for 1 minute. A creature cursed this way has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws, has the skeleton's Etherealness bonus action, has the skeleton's Ethereal Sight trait, and gains a fly speed of 15 ft. with the ability to hover.
>
>  As an action, a cursed creature can repeat the saving throw to attempt to end the curse. If a creature would return to Material Plane in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, it is immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it is moved.   
>
> ***Ethereal Sight.*** The skeleton can see 60 ft. into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
>
> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The skeleton can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.***  The skeleton makes two spectral khopesh attacks. If both attacks hit the same creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop an object of the skeleton's choice. The object lands at the creature's feet, and if the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 8), the skeleton can have the object flung up to 10 feet away from the creature in the direction of the skeleton's choice. The skeleton can choose for the flung item to enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. The item returns to the plane it was shunted from after 1 minute.
>
> ***Spectral Khopesh.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  12 (3d6 + 2) force damage.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Etherealness.*** The skeleton enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
>




> ##### Option Rules: Binding Curses or Longer lasting Curses
>If you're running an adventure where your players turning ethereal and being able to move through objects would be problematic, you can modify the curse so that creatures under its effects can't move, be moved, or be teleported more than 30 feet away from where the skeleton that cursed them died. On the flip side, if you want to make the curse a key part of how players explore an adventure location, you can extend its duration.

### Tomb Guard
These soldiers served as elite infantry and personal guards to their kings. As a reward for their service, they were granted more elaborate burial rites upon their death. Though these rites were nowhere near the complexity of those reserved for royalty, they allowed the tomb guard to retain some semblance of their personality into undeath. In addition to being excellent soldiers and bodyguards, these soldiers are capable of verbal communication, abstract reasoning, and carrying out higher-level strategic plans. They answer directly to their kingdom’s rulers and ensure their will is carried out in the field of battle. 

#### Eternal Guard
Though all tomb guard legions consider themselves to be “eternal,” this legion takes the expression to the extreme by courting the favor of their death god in exchange for regenerative abilities. This blessed regeneration allows the enteral guard to suffer devastating assaults and rise again to ruthlessly cut down those who thought they could best the elite soldiers of the death god. Such is their tenacity that they don’t bother with using shields for protection and instead duel-wield khopeshes so they may better cut down their comparatively fragile foes.

### Tomb Kingdom Infantry Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these undead soldiers in your games:

##### Tomb Kingdom Infantry Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The players find an artifact deep in a crypt protected by necromantic wards. As they attempt to bypass its defenses, the artifact awakens waves of skeletal soldiers who threaten to overwhelm them.|
|  2  |The players search a coastal desert for buried treasures lost to shipwrecks over the years. However, the sands also hide skeletal soldiers ready to awaken the moment they’re disturbed.  |
|  3  | The players explore an impossible underground labyrinth patrolled by netherworld warriors. By purposely exposing themselves to the nether-curse of these warriors, the players can ethereally explore the otherwise untraversable dungeon.   |
|  4  | The players come across a battlefield where legions of skeletal soldiers clash against one another, continually reassembling and marching back into the fray as they are destroyed.|

> ##### Mummy Soldiers
> Mummy Soldiers
The skeletal soldiers and tomb warriors presented here are assumed to be more skeletal than mummy-like and, as such, have a weakness to bludgeoning damage rather than fire damage. If you wish to flavor these minions as being lesser mummies, you can change their bludgeoning weakness to fire weakness.

## Tomb Chariots & Cavalry
The ancient tomb kingdoms were masters of using warhorses to gain the edge over their more primitive opponents. These steeds were so prized they were entombed with their riders when they died. When the legions of the tomb kingdoms rise to make war once more, their loyal steeds rise with them and ride out to meet any enemy foolish enough to stand against the deathless legions.

You can use the stats for the warhorse skeleton from the Monster Manual to represent most of these steeds and have them serve as mounts for any of the tomb kingdom infantry.

### Chariots of The Dead

Not only were the tomb kingdoms masters of mounted combat, but they were also among the first civilizations to use chariots in warfare. Because the tomb kings were seen as divine beings, it was forbidden for them to sully themselves by riding on the back of an animal. As such, war chariots were created to carry them into battle, where they could move between important locations to deliver instructions and charge vulnerable foes. War chariots soon came to be seen as a symbol of status among the royalty, with the most powerful tomb kings able to field legions of thundering chariots to crush their foes. 

Great care was taken to preserve these chariots for use in the afterlife, and when the undying tomb legions march to battle, these chariots thunder alongside them. The chariots almost serve as an extension of their undead charioteer’s will, and they are utilized by tomb soldiers and royalty alike with terrifying results. 

Rules for chariots can be found at the end of the document.

If the chariot moves at least 20 feet in a straight line before the attacks are made, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) damage and each creature hit must then succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the chariot.<br> If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 7), it becomes terrified of the chariot and must use the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the chariot by the safest available route while it is frightened this way, unless there is nowhere to move. <br> A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Royal Warhorse Mummy
Most steeds were preserved using the same rituals as common soldiers. However, like their human counterparts, greater rites of preservation were used for those of greater status. The most prized steeds kept by the ancient royalty were given proper rituals of mummification when they died. When these steeds return to the land of the living, they do so with the unnatural vitality and terrifying powers of their royal masters. 

In war, mummified warhorses serve as steeds for the most elite tomb soldiers and pull the chariots of the tomb royalty. Their cursed hooves doom any they strike, and their terrifying equine glare breaks the will of all but the most resolute soldiers. Never tiring of their duty, these elite steeds work in tangent with their undying riders to destroy any that stand against their terrifying charge.

The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.

If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 9), it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.

### Desert Storm Riders
The skeletal cavalry of the tomb legions are often used as outriders to harass and harry foes using their speed in conjunction with guerilla warfare. The most feared of these outriders are the legendary Desert Storm riders. This legion of horsemen were notorious for their ability to sweep up great clouds of sand as they rode, which they would use as cover to enable disorienting hit-and-run attacks.

These riders' regiments included melee warriors for running down vulnerable foes and skilled archers for picking apart enemies from a distance. Together, they would often act as a vanguard force that would throw enemy forces into disarray while kicking up great clouds of dust that would make it hard to target or identify the rest of the approaching tomb kingdom army. After the enemy army was broken and routed, the Storm Riders would run down fleeing soldiers, brutely slaying them during their panicked retreat. 

In their new unlife, these riders continue to serve their kingdom, patrolling the desert and running down any would-be intruders. Many adventuring expeditions into the realm of the tomb kingdoms have been cut short by these merciless cavalrymen.

## Ushabti

The people of the ancient <br> tomb kingdoms <br> worshipped pantheons <br> of gods who were said to <br> blend aspects of animal <br> and human. They possessed <br> the heads of powerful desert <br> beasts, the bodies of humans, and each <br> presided over their respective domains. <br> The people of these kingdoms created <br> many imposing statues of these deities, and <br> when their priests learned how to preserve <br> and bind the spirits of the fallen, they began <br> the practice of enshrining the spirits of <br> their most powerful warriors within these <br> statues. Known as ushabti, they stand <br> watch over the most important temples <br> and necropolises of the tomb kingdoms, <br> where they remain motionless but ever <br> vigilant. 

Ushabtis awaken only when they detect <br> intruders or hear the summons of a powerful <br> tomb priest. In either case, they stride into <br> battle, wielding giant ornate weapons, from <br> intricately etched blades capable of cutting a horse <br> in half to gilded longbows with blessed arrows the <br> size of spears. Ushabtis use their weapons with ease,  <br>cutting a swath through would-be intruders and invaders, making them the perfect sentries and monstrous soldiers for their eternal kingdom.

&emsp;***Chosen of the Gods.*** These ushabtis are <br> possessed by the spirits of mighty archers who <br> have earned the blessings of their gods. While <br> all ushabtis utilize blessed arrows, these <br> warriors are capable of performing miraculous <br> feats with their divine ammunition, such as <br> raining volleys of radiant arrows down upon <br> foes in a deadly barrage. The elevated rank of <br> these archers means they are available only to <br> the most powerful of tomb lords and employed <br> for only the most important of duties, such as <br> providing ranged support in critical battles or <br> protecting the most sacred of temples.

***Soul Wardens.*** These ushabtis are built to <br> imprison the souls of those who have earned a <br> special ire from the tomb lords. They are capable <br> of tearing out the souls of their victims and <br> trapping them within their construct bodies. <br> Some transport the souls of the victims to their <br> masters for further punishment, but many serve <br> as a prison for the soul of an especially powerful transgressor, such as a traitorous priest, <br> renegade necromancer, or even a powerful <br> demon. The presence of a tomb warden serves <br> as a grim reminder to would-be tomb robbers <br> that a fate worse than death awaits them should <br> they fall into the clutches of these dreaded <br> guardians.

If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become incapacitated and have its speed become 0 as the ushabti begins ripping the target's soul from its body. This effect ends if the ushabti dies or uses this ability again. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If it fails the repeated saving throw by 5 or more (DC 10) the creature dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the ushabti until it the ushabti dies or traps another soul. While a creature's soul is trapped, it can't be resurrected. <br> If a creature is struck by this attack again while already incapacitated by its effect, it doesn’t make another save, but instead makes its next save against the effect with disadvantage.

## Bone Giant

Though these mighty beings appear to be the skeletons of enormous giants, they are, in fact, constructs carved from wood and stone. In ancient times, they were created as monumental tributes to legendary kings and heroes. As the death priests learned to bind souls and manipulate the death, they began binding powerful spirits to these statues. These spirits remain dormant for ages at a time until they are called upon to serve their lost kingdom. 

When they're stirred into action, bone giants draw huge bows and unleash blessed arrows the size of a ballista bolt capable. Even those who manage to overcome the sheer terror of the bone giant's presence and engage it in close quarters will still need to contend with melee attacks capable of pulverizing most humanoids in a single blow. And those who survive long enough to land a blow will be unlikely to overcome the defenses of its nearly indestructible frame.

## Titan of the Gods

These massive ornate constructs were built to serve as conduits to the netherworld. They preside over the tombs of ancient kings, ensuring they are guided to the afterlife. In one hand, they wield a massive sun staff that lights the way through the netherworld and allows them to unleash solar rays through their burning eyes. In the other hand, they carry a set of scales used to judge the worthiness of souls and rip apart the life force of those still living. 

When stirred to battle, the titan of the gods serves as an avatar of the divine that walks the mortal realm. Its connection to the realm of the gods allows divine beings to hear the prayers and rituals beseeching them for power more clearly. Those who draw on the gods for power find they can more freely call upon that power in the presence of this titan, and the titan serves as a messenger to communicate the gods' will to their supplicants.

## Tomb Lords
These monarchs ruled vast <br> kingdoms when civilization was <br> still young. Their ruthless ambition <br> saw them conquer huge territories <br> and amass untold troves of wealth. <br> Their egos were such that they saw <br> themselves as above death. So, they <br> had themselves mummified so they <br> could rule their kingdoms for eternity. <br> However, they’ve awoken to find their <br> bodies as shriveled husks and their kingdoms <br> crumbling and pillaged of treasures. Though <br> they still possess immense physical might, they <br> can no longer enjoy the sensations of life. Though they <br> still have many riches, much of it was stolen. Though they still have loyal subjects, they are undead minions only possessing a shadow of their former selves.

The rage at what they’ve lost and their desire to retake <br> what they feel the afterlife owes them drives the tomb <br> lords ruthlessly reclaim their territory and punish any trespassers in their domain. This indomitable will <br> manifests itself in their undead subjects, who become <br> much more formidable in the presence of their lord.

***Chosen of the Gods.*** The monarchy of these <br> long-lost kingdoms claimed to be divinely blessed, if <br> not the direct descendants of gods themselves. Those <br> struck by tomb lords experience direct evidence to <br> back this claim, for these undying monarchs strike <br> with the divine fury of their patron gods. This blessing <br> may come in the form of poisonous strikes, attacks <br> enhanced with solar radiance, or an onslaught so <br> vicious it mentally scars victims and forces them to <br> drop to their knees in prostration. 

The most sinister of these divine manifestations is <br> not a blessing on the tomb lord but a curse on anyone <br> who strikes it down. These curses reflect the gods <br> who favored the tomb lord and may leave victims <br> racked with poison, unable to recall learned <br> knowledge, or feeling the inevitable pull of death <br> tugging at their souls.

***Tomb Princes.*** Most members of ancient royalty <br> were not destined for the throne. The sons of mighty monarchs who were not heirs to the throne served as commanders and enforcers for their father’s will. <br> Many strive to earn favor with their king, performing <br> deeds in his name as they jockey for positions in the <br> royal hierarchy. Others seek to gather enough power <br> to dethrone their father and take his place at the <br> head of an undying kingdom of their own.

### Additional Curses of the Gods

Many tomb lords have a specific god they regard as their patron. These gods enact divine punishments on those who strike the tomb lord down in a unique way that makes it clear which deity has been angered. You may replace the effects of the tomb prince’s or tomb king’s Vengeful Curse with one of the following curses.

#### Curse of Death's Grip
This is the most common curse tomb lords inflict and is the default curse listed in their stat blocks. The curse is inflicted by gods associated with death and funerary rites. Those under its effect feel the inevitable pull of the grave tugging at their soul.

While cursed this way, the target automatically fails any death saving throws it makes and treats the roll as if it rolled a 1.

#### Curse of the Glaring Sun
Many of the greatest kings of old claimed to be blessed by, or even descendent from, the god of the sun. Those who cut down these monarchs are cursed by the sun’s perpetual glare. 

Whenever a creature cursed this way is in direct sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

#### Curse of the Lost Lessons
Some monarchs made gods of knowledge their patron deities in hopes of receiving their wisdom. Those who earn the ire of these gods soon find themselves stripped of such wisdom.

The cursed creature can't add its proficiency bonus to skill checks, tool checks, or saving throws.

#### Curse of the Marked Prey
Monarchs who were fierce warriors and hunters earned the favor of gods of the wild. Those cursed by such gods become easy prey to their enemies. 

Weapon attacks against the cursed creature can't suffer from disadvantage.


#### Curse of the Serpent's Kiss
The cursed creature loses any immunity or resistance it has to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Additionally, if this curse originated from a tomb prince, and the creature takes any piercing, slashing, or poison damage, the creature takes an additional 2(1d4) poison damage. If the curse originated from a tomb king, it instead takes an additional 4 (1d8) poison damage.

#### Sun Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) radiant damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw.

On a failure, the creature is poisoned until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn.

# Chariots

Chariots are iconic vehicles of war, allowing mighty steeds to pull soldier-filled carriages into battle. The number of steeds able to pull a chariot and the number of riders its carriage can support varies from one vehicle to the next. Some are even designed to be pulled by creatures other than horses. Chariots may charge headlong into enemy forces or ride past foes who are then dispatched by scythed wheels and spear-wielding riders. They are often a status symbol, and many warrior generals lead their armies from them. In some cultures, chariots are used for racing or other gladiatorial sporting events. 

The following rules can help you codify ways to use chariots in your games. They can be applied to chariots of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own chariots. The rules here can be applied to most vehicles pulled by other creatures, such as wagons and carriages. At the end of the document, there are some example chariots you can incorporate into your own games.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.



#### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, chariots are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The chariot may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by steeds.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.



> ##### Determining Chariot CR
>When building your own chariot, you can determine its CR using most of the creature creation guidelines described in the DMG with the following modifications:
> * Determine its Offensive CR using additional damage per round it grants to its riders and steeds.
> * Determine its Defensive CR using half its HP.
> * Consider other traits it has the same way you would consider creature attributes.
