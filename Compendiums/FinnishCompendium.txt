## Black Iron Dogs
Black iron dogs are the greatest tools a shamanistic blacksmith can create, servants of unmatched power and loyalty. With a heart of iron, organs made of brass, and flesh made of copper, coated with hair made from black steel, they exude a grim presence as their eyes and throat burn with intense heat when aroused to anger.

These hounds serve a critical role for the greatest blacksmiths, venturing into faraway lands to fetch rare ingredients for magical crafting. Sent out in packs, their intellect is far greater than most constructs, and they possess a fierce loyalty to their creator. This means they are never deterred from their goal and will not be persuaded to betray their creator, able to act completely autonomously from their master. They are also equipped with supernatural senses, allowing them to sniff out magic and pinpoint even the rarest ingredients.

Not only are the dogs used for their tracking abilities, but they also serve as guards. With their supernatural senses and fierce iron bodies, few foes can get past an iron dog, let alone a pack. Beyond their terrible metal jaws and natural pack tactics, they can unleash a howl that heats the air before them, making any metal in the area burn red hot, cooking any that are in contact with it.



**Furnace Stomach.** Perhaps the most disturbing feature of these beast-like constructs is their ability to open their jaws at a 90-degree angle, allowing them to swallow substantially large objects or creatures into their spacious metal stomach. Inside the stomach, objects can be stored and carried back to their master. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The hound can also serve as a furnace; often, these hounds are sent to find rare magical ores, and on their trip back, after finding these resources, their stomach burns hot, melting down the newly found prize.  Ultimately, they defecate the slag byproduct and vomit up purified metal. They can also dispose of foes this way, cooking them in their metal stomach until there’s nothing but ash to cough up.

### Vile Iron Dogs
Vile iron dogs are a variant designed for the macabre purpose of gathering ingredients for poisons and other toxic substances. The furnace stomach of a regular iron dog is replaced with an advanced chamber capable of producing toxins as any alchemist's lab would, extracting and recombining anything it has consumed. Some poisoners who own these dogs do not stop at having their constructs gather ingredients and produce poisons; they also use the hounds to deliver these deadly substances.

Many chieftains and warlords pay poisoners who own a vile iron dog to eliminate a rival clan or a particularly powerful warrior. When dispatched on such a task, the dog will find its target and bite down, swallowing it. If the creature survives, it is subjected to the deadly concoction the dog has created, which can overcome even the most legendary of warriors. Additionally, these creatures have the terrifying ability to regurgitate the poisons they've created in a gaseous form, covering a large area. This toxic cloud is potent enough to sicken and kill even the most battle-hardened warriors.

### Black Iron Dog Tactics
Black iron dogs possess the ability to perform basic reasoning and think independently. Despite this autonomy, they are unwaveringly loyal and will not betray their master's interests. The two scenarios in which the players are most likely to clash with black iron dogs are situations where the dogs are guarding an area or where the dogs are competing with the players for a resource they are trying to gather.

#### Guarding an Area
&emsp;**Pack Tactics.** While guarding a territory, black iron dogs operate in groups of three or more so they can employ pack tactics. They work together to isolate and surround targets, giving them advantage on attacks.

**Swallowing Foes.** The dogs will work together to each swallow one of their attackers. By diving up enemies this way, they can keep any individual dog from being surrounded.

**Heated Howl.** If the dogs see three or more adversaries close to each other, or at least two adversaries with one wearing metal, they prefer utilizing their heated howl ability over engaging in melee combat. 

#### Resource Collection
In their role as collectors, black iron dogs are tasked with acquiring specific objects. They focus on swiftly seizing these items and retreating without delay.

**Encountering Resistance:** In situations where an item is already in the possession of a creature, the dogs have a simple countermeasure: they swallow the creature to retrieve the item, then promptly evacuate the area with both the item and the creature. This direct approach ensures the fulfillment of their retrieval mission while minimizing prolonged conflict. 


#### Vile Iron Dog Tactics
The only tactical difference with vile iron dogs is their poison breath. They use this ability when they can target two or more adversaries simultaneously. Their toxic breath serves a secondary purpose as area control, as they can't be damaged by their own fog.

### Iron Dogs Loot

The valuable items looted from iron dogs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) check to harvest metal.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Iron Dog Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Black Iron Dog Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1d6(3) 5gp Items |
|  8-10 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items | 
|  11-17 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items  |  
|  18-21 | 1d4(2) 20gp Items |  
|  22+ |  1d6(3) 20gp Items |  

##### Vile Iron Dog Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-6  | 2d4(5) 5gp Items |
|  7-9 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items | 
|  10-16 | 1d4(2) 20gp Items  |  
|  17-21 | 1d6(3) 20gp Items |  
|  22+ |  2d4(5) 20gp Items | 

#### Example Iron Dog Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names. You can choose the burning or toxic descriptor based on whether the creature is a black iron hound or a vile iron hound.


##### Example Iron Dog Item Names
|1d4 | 5gp Item | 10gp Item | 20gp Item |

## Hiisi's Cat

A hiisi's cat is a peculiar construct <br> resembling a feline the size of a bobcat, <br> crafted from blackened wood that is <br> perpetually ablaze. This unique being is <br> forged from the coffin lids of the deceased, using <br> coals collected from mountainous regions inhabited by <br>  cursed spirits. Its sole purpose is to punish thieves by tormenting them until they return the stolen  items.

Some hiisi's cats serve as guardians, initially appearing as dormant piles of black wood and coal. They spring to life in a burst of flames when the item they are protecting is taken. These cats possess an innate ability to locate the stolen object and will relentlessly pursue the thief.

In other instances, hiisi's cats are created in response to an item being stolen. Upon their creation, they are informed of the object's nature and instinctively know its location. However, if the ritual to summon a hiisi's cat is performed with the intent of retrieving an item that does not rightfully belong to the summoner, the cat will become enraged and turn against its creator, angered by the deceit.

These constructs are unyielding in their pursuit. Some particularly formidable versions cannot be stopped by destruction; if damaged beyond functionality, their bodies disintegrate into ash. Should the original pyre from which they were created remain intact, it will reignite within a few days, resurrecting the hiisi's cat with renewed determination. The only definitive way to halt a hiisi's cat is by destroying the original pyre from which it was made.

***Cat Scratch Curse.*** The claws of a hiisi's cat are a formidable instrument of punishment, functioning not only as red-hot talons but also as a means to inflict a curse upon their victims. This curse subjects the afflicted to a burning pain whenever they come into contact with the object that the hiisi's cat is tasked with retrieving. Furthermore, the curse renders the victim incapable of affecting the object with magic. Should the cursed individual sustain additional scrapes or scratches from the cat, they will experience an intensified surge of searing pain. Only the most adept thieves or warriors stand a chance of retaining the object without succumbing to the overwhelming urge to drop it and flee for their lives.

> ***Illumination.*** The cat can choose to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light in an additional 15 feet. It can end the light as a bonus action on its turn.
>
> ### Reaction
>
> ***Scrape.*** If a creature within 5 feet of the cat takes the Disengage action, the cat can make an attack against that creature.




\pagebreakNum

> ##### Optional Trait
> ***Rejuvenation.*** If the pyre that the hiisi's cat was created from is still intact, a destroyed hiisi's cat gains a new body in 1d4 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the pyre.

<br>

### Hiisi's Cat Tactics
The hiisi's cat's primary goal is always the retrieval and protection of the object to which it is bound. Its primary strategy involves stealthily approaching any individual in possession of the object and using its claws to inflict a curse. If the cursed individual drops the item, the cat will seize the opportunity to grab the object and attempt to flee.

#### Engaging In Combat

In situations where escape is hindered by the presence of one or more enemies, the hiisi's cat will engage in combat to achieve its objective. When forced into a confrontation, it instinctively targets ranged attackers, quickly closing the gap to prevent their escape and leveraging its Scrape reaction to make escape hazardous. The cat then concentrates its efforts on the selected target, exploiting its ability to induce inflamed pain through its attacks.

### Hiisi's Cat Loot
The valuable items looted from hiisi's cats will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Carver’s Tools) check to harvest the wood scraps from the hiisi's cat.

#### Hiisi's Cat Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Hiisi's Cat Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |

## Hirvi

Hirvi are mythical constructs fashioned in the likeness of moose, elk, or reindeer, composed of wood, branches, and grass. Within their intricately knotted and woven bodies shines a faint light, centered around a small fire that animates them and captivates any who behold it. These creatures roam the frozen forests and tundras of the world, serving as guides to travelers, leading them either to safety or to perilous, icy ends.

Regarded as lost constructs, legends suggest that the hirvi were crafted by ancient tribes who ventured into the harshest, frozen reaches of the world, where scarcity made traditional beasts of burden impractical. The creators of the hirvi, skilled artificers, designed them to endure the extreme cold and to protect the tribe from the harsh climate. The fate of these pioneering tribes and the origins of the hirvi remain shrouded in mystery.

***Guides and Guardians.*** Hirvi are now encountered wandering the frigid regions of the world, where they may come across travelers in need. Upon finding such individuals, a hirvi offers assistance, either by guiding them to safety or by allowing them to warm themselves by its side for a while. The warmth and light emanating from a hirvi's core not only possess the ability to heal frostbite and wounds within minutes but also imbue those in its presence with a revitalizing effect. This vitality enables those who bask in the hirvi's light to endure and navigate through the harshest cold, pushing onward to safety. After providing aid, a hirvi invariably returns to the secluded cold of the wilderness, disappearing as mysteriously as it appeared.

 > ##### Mythological Inspiration
> The hiirvi here are inspired by creatures from Finnish folklore. However, the master hiirvi (described later in the document) are a blend of inspirations from Finnish folklore and Innu mythology.

<br>

### Hiiden Hirvi

The hiiden hirvi, also known as the Goblin’s Elk, is a darker counterpart to the benign Hirvi constructs. These variants are the creation of malevolent entities residing in the darkest, coldest reaches of the world. They emerged when ancient tribes ventured into these forbidding territories with the assistance of their hirvi constructs. It is believed that these malevolent forces crafted their own versions of the hirvi as a cruel means of mocking the incoming tribes.

Unlike the hirvi, which houses a warm, glowing fire in its chest, the hiiden hirvi's chest emits a dim blue light. This eerie luminescence chills anything it touches. Moreover, the invigorating effect associated with the light of a typical hirvi is perverted in the hiiden hirvi; instead of revitalizing those who see it, this light instills an irresistible urge to follow the creature. The hiiden hirvi exploits this compulsion, luring its victims into deadly snowdrifts and blizzards, turning it into a perilous beacon in the frozen wilderness.

The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with hunting the hirvi until the hirvi uses this ability again. An obsessed creature knows the hirvi's location if they are on the same plane of existence and cannot be slowed by exhaustion. If the target is more than 10 feet away from the hirvi, it must move on its turn toward the hirvi by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet, and can then take the rest of its turn as normal. The creature doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain or whenever it takes damage from a source other than the hirvi, the target can repeat the saving throw. An obsessed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully saves is immune to this hirvi's Luring Chase for 24 hours.

### Master Hirvi

In rare instances, a hirvi experiences a profound sense of longing and loneliness, driving it to seek companionship beyond its solitary existence in the frozen wastes. These unique hirvi are drawn to deer herds, where they find a sense of kinship. Over time, they integrate themselves into these herds, forming deep attachments and becoming fiercely protective of their new companions. The herd gradually accepts the hirvi as one of its own, marking a transformation in the hirvi. It becomes a guardian of the group, and its powers evolve beyond those of a solitary hirvi. The magic it emanates adapts to the needs of the herd, allowing the hirvi to spend lifetimes caring for its adopted family.

These hirvi guard their surrogate herds with unparalleled ferocity, defending them against predators, including humanoid hunters. The enhanced physical endurance and strength of a master hirvi set it apart from its kin, and the light it emits can deflect the arrows and spears of hunters. Furthermore, the hirvi can imbue members of its herd with extraordinary vigor, turning even a caribou's charge into a deadly force capable of pulverizing bone.

\columnbreak

Beyond physical prowess, these hirvi are more intelligent and cunning than any deer and hold complete obedience and loyalty from the herd. This allows the hirvi to lead its herd with remarkable coordination, evading hunters' traps or even orchestrating counterattacks against local populations.

Many who live near a herd protected by a master hirvi choose not to confront the creature, recognizing that only legendary hunters could possibly challenge such a formidable leader, especially with the support of its kin. Instead, many locals come to revere the hirvi, building shrines and offering tributes to it and its herd. In some cases, the master hirvi may permit limited hunting of its kind, on the condition that their habitat is respected, preserved, and safeguarded against external threats beyond the hirvi's control.

However, there are instances where master hirvi become overzealous, disrupting the natural balance of their territories. Predators such as wolves may begin to starve, unable to prey on the protected herds. Human settlements can be devastated, trampled under the hooves of caribou or elk herds, forcing residents to flee their homes. In response to these disruptions, druids or other guardians of nature often seek adventurers to address the imbalance, aiming to curb the overly protective instincts of these master hirvi and restore harmony to the land.

### Hirvi Tactics

Hirivi utilize hit-and-run tactics. They charge in with their horns before running out of reach to repeat the process on their next turn, using their Back Kick against anyone who makes an opportunity attack against them.
Additionally, they can use their Guiding Warmth ability to help position allies, such as by pulling vulnerable targets out of danger or helping melee creatures get into combat.

#### Hiiden Hirvi Tactics
Hiiden hirvi do best in perilous combat environments, such as snowstorms, icy lakes, or areas with significant obscurity or hazards. They prefer ambush tactics and will try to single out and isolate vulnerable targets from a group, such as fragile spellcasters.

##### Wearing Down Pursuers
The signature tactic of the hiiden hirvi is to wear down foes while goading them into pursuit. Below are a few things to keep in mind when the hirvi is being pursued.
* Ensure that the pursuer is ending its turn in the hirvi's aura.
* Don't engage in melee combat with a target that's a more formidable melee fighter; such targets should be drawn into pursuit.
* If a target not under the influence of Luring Chase is catching up with the hirvi, use a charge attack to try and knock it prone before retreating out of range.


#### Master Hirvi Tactics

Master hirvi command herds of creatures, such as elk, caribou, or other types of deer, and will usually have at least three creatures with it that can benefit from its abilities. 

* Prioritize taking down ranged attackers.
* Creatures enhanced with Might of the Herd should focus on bringing down high-priority targets (such as ranged attackers).
* Coordinate the herd's movement so they all benefit from Hunter's Bane; creatures should try to end their turn in the aura whenever possible.

##### Master Hirvi Retreat
How and when a master hirivi retreats can vary from one to the next. Some view themselves as too valuable to the herd's overall survival to risk death and will retreat if the battle turns unfavorable, potentially sacrificing their fellow deer to secure their escape. In contrast, other Hirvis are deeply committed to their herd, willing to sacrifice themselves to ensure the safety and escape of the rest of their herd.

### Hirvi Loot

The valuable items looted from hirvi will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Hirvi Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Primal Forged Constructs

In the ancient world, the distinctions between druids, artificers, and necromancers were blurred, if not entirely non-existent. These figures, often revered as great shamanistic blacksmiths, navigated the delicate veil separating the living from the dead. Through their journeys across these realms, they accumulated not only profound mystic knowledge but also a diverse array of rare materials. This confluence of spiritual insight and physical resources culminated in the creation of what came to be known as primal forge constructs.

These constructs were formidable entities, pieced together from wood, bone, and stone, giving life to these inanimate amalgams by infusion of spirits of wild predators. This process birthed hulking beasts that bore the ferocity and primal essence of the natural world within their fabricated frames.

The master creators of these primal forge constructs have long since faded into history, their names forgotten and their techniques lost to time. Despite the disappearance of their creators, many of these majestic beasts still exist. Hidden away in the remotest wildernesses, they are remnants of a bygone era, embodying the mystical fusion of both the natural and unnatural.

### Chaining The Beasts
Efforts to replicate the ancient technique behind the creation of primal forged constructs have consistently failed among contemporary artificers and wizards. 

Yet, a breakthrough of sorts has been achieved by some ingenious artificers who have developed specialized chains capable of binding these formidable creatures to their will.

Employing these chains is no trivial matter. It requires an individual, whether brave or reckless, to dare approach one of these ferocious constructs and securely fasten the chain around its neck. Success in this perilous endeavor allows the individual to exert a form of control over the construct, rendering it docile and obedient.

Once subdued, the primal forged constructs are kept in secure locations by their new masters, ready to be unleashed when the need arises. To deploy the construct, its keeper simply removes the chain and issues a command, which must be executed immediately for the construct to respond. The nature of these commands is crucial; they must be simple and direct, as anything complex or ambiguous will not be understood, leading the construct to revert to its wild state.

This precarious balance of control has led to the use of primal forged constructs as tools of intimidation and coercion. Owners often threaten to unleash their constructs on communities or foes, saying they can command the beast to "destroy that village" or "kill the king" unless their demands are met. However, these threats are frequently bluffs, as the degree of control one can exercise over these primal entities is greatly exaggerated.

### Iron Track Wolves

Among the myriad of primal forged constructs, a renowned variant is the iron track wolf. These formidable constructs are created by imbuing the spirits of pack dire wolves into a meticulously crafted frame made of wood, iron, and bone. The name "iron track wolf" derives from their unique ability to influence the very earth they roam. As these wolves tread, metal is drawn from the depths of the earth to the surface, trailing behind them.

The most astonishing aspect of the iron track wolf's power is its ability to manipulate these metallic deposits. Metal fragments in the wolf's wake are like living plants, growing into iron and copper brambles with thorns as sharp as any forged spear. Over time, these metallic growths transform remote areas into glades of twisted metal. Many have been lured by the prospect of harvesting these "iron plants," only to meet their demise amidst the deadly thorns.

The physical prowess of the iron track wolf is not to be underestimated. It possesses an extraordinarily powerful bite, capable of crippling any foe caught in it. Yet, it is the wolf's howl that is truly fearsome — a chilling blend of the calls of baying wolves and the sound of scraping metal. This haunting noise instills an uncontrollable fear in those who hear it, driving them to flee in panic, only to find themselves ensnared in a labyrinth of twisted metal barbs, with the relentless wolf closing in from behind.

### Earth Breaker Bears
Among the designs of primal forged constructs, the earth breaker bears stand as both the rarest and most formidable. These majestic constructs are adorned with a coat of moss and aged leather, and are equipped with teeth and claws crafted from stone or iron. Within their imposing frames resides the spirit of a tyrant polar bear, granting them a profound connection and immense power over the earth itself.

The earth breaker bears are the pinnacle of ancient artificers' craft. In the absence of their original creators to guide and command them, many of these bears have retreated into the depths of the earth, entering a state of eternal hibernation. However, their peace is easily disturbed; unsuspecting excavators who unwittingly awaken these slumbering beasts often meet a tragic end as the constructs lash out in a frenzied rampage, laying waste to everything in their vicinity before once again seeking refuge beneath the earth.

For those daring or fortunate enough to subdue an earth breaker bear, they serve as a powerful weapon. These constructs possess the ability to manipulate the very ground beneath them, shattering earth and stone with a mere swipe of their formidable claws. This power enables the earth breaker bear to execute surprise ambushes, emerging from beneath the ground to unleash a shower of debris capable of halting an entire unit of soldiers in their tracks.

Even more awe-inspiring is the bear's roar, which echoes the terrifying force of an earthquake or an avalanche. This sonic assault leaves adversaries shaken and dazed, with some unable to move, rendering them helpless before the might of the ursine construct.

#### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Earth Smash (3/Day).*** The bear slams the ground, causing a tremor. Each creature on the ground in a 20-foot cube originating from the bear must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 19 (3d12) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

### Primal Construct Tactics
#### Iron Track Wolf Tactics
Iron track wolves initiate combat with an ambush, leveraging their iron growth ability to encircle foes with a ring of thorns, effectively trapping them. They target the individual with the lowest Strength for their initial bite attack. They use their terrifying howl to drive enemies into the iron thorns. 

This tactic is ideal when the wolf assesses that it can ensnare two or more targets within the thorny trap. The wolf remains mobile throughout the encounter, continually generating new thorny areas to control the battlefield and hinder its opponents.

#### Earth Breaker Bear Tactics
Earth breaker bears launch their attacks from underground, surfacing to immediately unleash their stunning roar, followed by an earth smash. They prioritize attacking the largest cluster of enemies, moving to maximize the impact of their assaults and control the flow of the battle. The bears use their abilities in a calculated manner to incapacitate and disperse groups of foes, maintaining pressure and exploiting the chaos caused by their surprise emergence and powerful attacks.


### New Magic Item

#### Chain of Command
*Wondrous item, very rare, 20,000gp*<br>
This 15 ft. long chain is designed to subdue and control primal forged constructs, linking them to the wielder's will (iron track wolves and earth breaker bears are considered primal forged constructs.)

**Attaching The Chain.** While holding the chain with both hands, you can use an action to attempt to attach it to a primal forged construct within 5 feet. This action is only possible if the construct is incapacitated, restrained, grappled, surprised, or has half its hit points or less.

If the construct is incapacitated or surprised, the chain automatically attaches to it. 

If the construct is not in these states, it can use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack with advantage against you. After the attack is resolved, you can make a contested Strength (Athletics) check against the construct. If the construct hits you with its reaction attack, you have disadvantage on this check. On a success, you attach the chain.

**Commanding Constructs.** Once the chain is attached, the construct becomes incapacitated and follows whoever is holding the chain. Whoever is holding the chain can use an action to detach it and give the construct a command. The construct will attempt to fulfill the command to the best of its ability. Commands must be simple and general, like "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." 

**Breaking Free.** After completing the command, the construct regains its independence. While executing the command, the construct resists any attempt to reattach the chain. The construct will also regain its independence an hour after the command is given, regardless of whether it completed the command.

### Primal Forged Constructs Loot
The valuable items looted from these constructs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Smith’s Tools) check to harvest metal.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Primal Forged Construct Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## The Lapp Eagle


Within the frigid lands of the dead, in kingdoms ruled by the deathless a construct compared to no other was forged, fires bellowed within the frozen land fueld by the souls of thousands of mighty warriors and the rarest of mystical metals were melted down and re-forged by a shamanistic blacksmiths whose names have long been forgotten to the living. After centuries of toil the Lapp Eagle was created.

The apocalyptic construct manifests as a colossal bird of prey, constructed from metal that perpetually seethes with heat and crackles with electricity. It possesses talons shaped like bladed sickles, capable of easily gripping a mammoth within each one, with lightning dancing between each razor-sharp claw. Its mouth, large enough to snap the thickest trees in half, harbors malevolent flames within its metallic throat when opened. Those fortunate enough to survive an attack from the creature's beak are branded by the magical heat, making them susceptible to intensified pain from any flame thereafter. With a wingspan of 200 feet and metal feathers each the size of a man and as sharp as a greatsword, its presence is overwhelming. The creature's metallic screech causes even the most seasoned warriors to hesitate, and those of weaker resolve to freeze in terror. Not even the most ancient dragons can compare to the sheer terror and devastation wrought by the presence of a Lapp Eagle soaring through the skies.

Although formidable in its own right, the Lapp Eagle's most deadly aspect is its role in the war between the living and the dead. Created by the forces of the dead, this titanic bird serves not only as a weapon of mass destruction but also as a carrier for their army. Embedded within each of its massive metal feathers is the soul of a long-deceased soldier.

With a violent flap of its wings, the Lapp Eagle can launch these feathers like missiles, akin to spears fired from a ballista. Upon landing, typically slicing through anything in their vicinity, the feathers begin to twist and contort, morphing into suits of metal armor. Encased within these armors are ghastly flames that manifest as spectral figures. These undead warriors, with bladed limbs integrated into their metallic exoskeletons, then commence a rampage, slicing through any living being in their path. The eagle is capable of unleashing a relentless barrage of these feathers, which it continually regenerates as molten metal drips from its body, forming new plumage.

The Lapp Eagle is a creature of myth, believed to herald the downfall of ancient civilizations whenever it crosses into the mortal realm. It is said that this can happen under specific conditions, such as when death and suffering in the lands of the living become so overwhelming that they weaken the barrier between this world and the next, allowing the Eagle to pass through. Others believe it requires summoning by a highly skilled and powerful shamanistic blacksmith through an eldritch ritual. The exact nature of this ritual, or why anyone would invoke such a cataclysmic force into our world, remains a mystery. No legend recounts the Eagle's defeat. Some stories suggest it is merely banished back to the realm of the dead by a cohort of powerful sorcerers, while others say that the barriers between the worlds strengthen once more, forcing the Eagle and its army to retreat. However, many seers foretell a day when it will invade our world again, this time unable to be repelled. They predict that the Lapp Eagle

> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the eagle is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
> 
> ***Bladed Feather.*** The eagle flaps its wings violently, sending one of its metal feathers at a point it can see within 300 feet of it. The point must be more than 30 feet away from the eagle. Each creature within 5 feet of the point must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) fire damage. A lapp soldier appears in the nearest unoccupied space to the point. Lapp soldiers created this way take their turns after the eagle on each round, one after another. The eagle can have up to 100 Soldiers summoned by this ability at one time. (NOTE: Only costs one legendary action?)

### The Lapp Eagle's Lair

Though the Lapp Eagle doesn't have a traditional lair, you can have an otherworldly storm with a 300-foot area centered on the eagle wherever it goes, which can act as its lair. 

While in its lair, the Lapp Eagle's challenge rating is 30 and is worth 155,000 XP.

The storm possesses an Intelligence of 18 and autonomously acts in the eagle's best interest. It is sentient and knows the location of any creature within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can invoke one of the following magical effects; the same effect cannot be used consecutively:

* **Thunderous Command:** A resounding thunderclap fills the air. The lair selects any number of lapp soldiers that can hear the clap. Each chosen soldier can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and then make one melee weapon attack.
* **Lightning Conduit:** A bolt of lightning strikes down from the storm at a designated point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Any creature, other than a lapp soldier, within 5 feet of a lapp soldier at this point has disadvantage on the saving throw.
* **Gust of Cinders:** A searing gust of wind sweeps through the area. Each creature within the storm takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. Creatures attempting concentration saves due to this damage do so with disadvantage. Additionally, the wind disperses gases and vapors.

##### Lapp Eagle Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Lapp Cult:** Rumors spread of a cult that seeks to summon the Lapp Eagle to bring about the end of the world. The adventurers must infiltrate this cult, learn the secrets of the eldritch ritual, and either prevent the summoning or prepare the world for the Eagle's arrival. |
|  2  | **The Underworld Forge:** The adventurers discover clues leading to the last known workshop of the shamanistic blacksmiths who created the Lapp Eagle. Exploring this ancient forge could reveal secrets to controlling or repelling the Eagle, but the forge is guarded by remnants of the blacksmiths' other creations and trapped within a land that blurs the lines between life and death. |
|  3  | **The Deathly Rifts:** Strange rifts between the mortal world and the realm of the dead begin to open, and the adventurers are tasked with closing them. As they travel from one rift to another, they learn that these are precursors to the arrival of the Lapp Eagle, and they must find a way to strengthen the barriers before the Eagle itself can pass through.|
|  4  | **The Fallen Feathers:** Following a violent storm, a village discovers several of the Lapp Eagle’s feathers near their homes, which transform into spectral warriors. The adventurers must defend the village and find a way to either destroy these feathers or use them to learn more about the Lapp Eagle's weaknesses.|

### Lapp Eagle Tactics 

The Lapp Eagle possesses formidable physical prowess, but its primary objective is to deploy the army it carries. It strategically avoids direct combat unless necessary, focusing instead on effectively using its abilities and spells from a distance.

**Long-Range Engagement:** When more than 120 feet away from the enemy, the eagle uses the following tactics:
* It targets three or more deadly enemies or any serious threat that has been incapacitated by its Dread Screech ability using its once-per-day spells.
* If no significant threats are present, or if potential targets are not adequately clustered, it casts *firewall* unless already concentrating on another spell; otherwise, it opts for *lightning bolt*.
* The eagle frequently uses its Bladed Feather legendary action to disrupt spellcasters and ranged attackers in the backline.

**Close-Range Combat:** If an enemy engages in melee or if the lapp soldiers are quickly being neutralized, the eagle employs the following tactics:
* The eagle shifts to using its talons and beak for direct attacks, focusing on the most significant threats or exploiting paralyzed targets to maximize damage.
* If three or more lapp soldiers are within 30 feet of each other, the eagle may reposition to provide them tactical advantages, such as allowing soldiers to benefit from enemies being restrained by its talons or branded by its beak.
* If fewer than two soldiers are available and no safe landing spots are present, the eagle may grasp an enemy and fly upward. On the following turn, it will ascend as high as possible, attack, and then drop the enemy to inflict maximum fall damage—unless it notes the enemy has resistance to bludgeoning damage.

**Strategic Use of Soldiers:**
* The eagle reserves its Ghastly War Cry for when four or more lapp soldiers can strike effectively or when multiple soldiers can target a paralyzed enemy.
* Lapp soldiers prioritize enemies that are restrained, branded, or paralyzed by the eagle to enhance their combat effectiveness.

### Lapp Eagle Loot
Because infernal destroyers are constructs, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tools), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Lapp Eagle Loot Table
The following table describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Sorrow Carriers 

Sorrow carriers are macabre and bizarre constructs. At first glance, they might appear to be slightly larger than an average raven when viewed from a distance. However, upon closer examination, their artificial nature becomes evident. They are constructed from a framework of bones and wood, held together by materials such as yarn, leather, or sinewy tendons. Their wings are crafted from strips of cloth and black feathers, creating an eerie yet intricate appearance.
Instead of traditional beaks, sorrow carriers feature thin, needle-like protrusions. These needles are connected by intestines or vines to a large container within the creature's chest cavity. This container can vary in material, ranging from clay pottery to leather bags, and serves as a core component of their function.

Sorrow carriers possess a unique ability to absorb and dispose of woe and misery from mortal beings. This encompasses a wide range of sadness, whether it stems from the loss of a loved one, failure in duty or service, or betrayal by a trusted individual. Through an extraordinary procedure, sorrow carriers can alleviate these emotional burdens, offering a peculiar form of relief to those they encounter.

***Taker of Anguish.*** A sorrow carrier employs its needle-like beak to penetrate a person overwhelmed by grief, extracting the emotions and storing them in its internal container. This procedure significantly alleviates the afflicted individual's emotional burden, making them feel as though a significant weight has been lifted from their shoulders.

However, this process is not without its potentially lethal risks. The container within the sorrow carrier holds a pure, concentrated form of sorrow it has extracted. If the sorrow carrier is destroyed and its container breached, this concentrated sorrow seeks out the nearest individual to inhabit. This sudden transfer can overwhelm the recipient with intense anguish in an instant, potentially causing severe mental trauma or even death to those unprepared for such a potent influx of emotion.


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

To mitigate these dangers, sorrow carriers are <br> compelled to dispose of the collected sadness in remote, isolated locations. Some of this sorrow is deposited at the borders of dark, otherworldly realms, while other portions are delivered to specially constructed wells. These wells are repositories of immense misery and sorrow, and any who drink from them or fall into their depths are subjected to unimaginable despair.

***Mysterious Purpose & Origin.*** The origins and purposes of sorrow carriers remain shrouded in mystery. These constructs traverse the lands, offering relief to those burdened by emotional pain, transporting these emotions to the farthest reaches of the world and even beyond. The creators of these beings and the entities they currently serve are subjects of speculation and rumor. There are whispers suggesting that sorrow carriers were fashioned by malevolent entities from shadowy realms, implying that their apparent acts of kindness—removing sadness from individuals—mask a more sinister agenda. It's speculated that these harvested emotions serve a darker purpose.

Among the most unsettling legends is the notion of a Raven Goddess, a deity characterized by her dark, destructive love, who is particularly fixated on the heartache associated with romantic love. This has led to observations that sorrow carriers often appear to those suffering from the pains of love. A theory exists suggesting that by removing an individual's pain, the person doesn't learn from their experiences or the consequences of their actions, thereby dooming them to repeat their mistakes and perpetuate a cycle of destructive love.

For those curious about the ultimate fate of the emotions collected by the sorrow carriers, their quest often ends in vain. Locations where these emotions are believed to be discarded are fiercely guarded by numerous sorrow carriers. Intruders risk being attacked by these constructs, which inject them with a fraction of the stored sorrow, overwhelming them with despair. To encounter a group, or "murder," of sorrow carriers, is to endure profound misery.

### Different Types of Sorrow
Sorrow bearers can have different types of sadness stored within them, representing the different types of sadness they have collected. This can make an encounter with different sorrow bearers more interesting as the players have to contend with the different types of sadness and their effects.

A regular sorrow bearer carries the Sorrow of Betrayal by default, but you can switch it with any of the sorrows listed below.

A creature can only suffer from one type of sorrow at a time.


#### Sorrow of Betrayal
 *The creature feels the heavy burden of betrayal by those it once trusted, causing unease towards those who approach.*

The creature suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks when another creature is within 5 feet of it and is not incapacitated.

#### Sorrow of Loneliness

*The creature experiences profound abandonment, finding the presence of companions insufficient to stave off the feeling of isolation.*

The creature has disadvantage on attacks and checks unless at least one of the creature's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

####  Sorrow of Failure
 
 *The creature endures the anguish of failing an important task or duty, with every misstep or defeat plunging it deeper into despair.*
 
Whenever the creature misses an attack or fails a check, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

#### Sorrow of Grief
*The creature feel the dread of losing someone close to them that they care dearly about, losing or seeing anyone, friend or foe, up on the brink of death sends a creature into a panic.*

Whenever the creature witnesses another creature dying or being reduced to 0 hit points, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

##### Sorrow Carrier Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Sorrow Theft:** A powerful figure hires the adventurers after experiencing a strange form of theft: their capacity to feel sorrow has been stolen, leaving them emotionally imbalanced and dangerously detached. The party must track down a rogue sorrow carrier that's absorbing emotions not to alleviate pain, but to serve a darker purpose.|
|  2  | **The Wells of Despair:** Rumors tell of wells filled with the pure essence of sorrow, where Sorrow Carriers dispose of their collected woes. When a well near a village overflows, the inhabitants begin to succumb to overwhelming despair.    |
|  3  | **Echoes of the Past:** The party encounters a Sorrow Carrier that is centuries old, carrying the sorrows of a long-forgotten tragedy. This ancient sorrow begins to seep into the land, resurrecting ghostly apparitions and reliving the events that led to the construct's creation.  |
|  4  | **Harvest of Tears:** An alchemist has discovered a way to manipulate the essence of sorrow collected by Sorrow Carriers, intending to use it as a component in a powerful elixir. However, the alchemist's experiments have unintended consequences, leading to outbreaks of acute melancholy in nearby towns.  |


### Sorrow Carrier Tactics
Sorrow carriers behave reactively and possess limited intelligence, focusing on guarding a specified area or object or delivering their sorrow to a designated location. 
<Br>

**Attack Pattern.** Their behavior in combat is generally predictable and follows the following order:

* Start by inflicting the initial transgressor (usually the creature at the forefront of a group) with sorrow.
* Work your way through the group, inflicting everyone with sorrow.
* Once everyone is inflicted with sorry, focus on the nearest creature suffering from disadvantage caused by the specific type of sorrow the carrier spreads.

**Retreat.** Upon being reduced to one-third of their maximum health (approximately 17 HP), sorrow carriers will attempt to flee. This instinctual retreat is driven by their imperative to prevent the dispersal of the sorrow they bear into the broader world.

### Sorrow Carrier Loot
The valuable items looted from sorrow carriers will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Carver’s Tools) check to harvest the wood scraps from the sorrow carrier



#### Sorrow Carrier Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
