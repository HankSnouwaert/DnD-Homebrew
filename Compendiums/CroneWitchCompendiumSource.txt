# Crone Witch Compendium

Deep within the heart of ancient forests, where sunlight barely pierces the canopy and roots reach down into the primordial earth, the crone witches make their abode. These enigmatic wise women, cloaked in the weight of countless years, are the bridge between the realm of mortals and the ethereal whispers of the spirit world. From within their secluded groves and moss-covered huts, they hear the laments of the trees and heed the counsel of long-forgotten spirits. Revered, feared, and wrapped in layers of superstition, the crone witches are more than mere spellcasters; they are the embodiment of the wild's mysterious essence.

A crone's power is deeply rooted in her bond with the land she calls home. The spirits of the forest, both benevolent and malevolent, heed her calls, granting her profound insights and formidable magical abilities. Animals, drawn by her innate connection to the natural world, often serve as her allies or guardians. In times of need, the crone might even call upon the land's ancient protectors, beasts of legend and creatures birthed from the very essence of the wild. 

\columnbreak

Other times, she will bind wild monstrosities to her will or enlist the aid of human allies at home in the wilds and aligned with her goals.

Some crone witches choose to form covens, bringing together their collective wisdom and power to serve a greater purpose. Led by the eldest among them, known as the mother, these covens can establish powerful bonds with specific forests, tapping into the very life force of the land to magnify their spells and incantations. With such profound ties to the natural world and the spirits that inhabit it, the crone witches are a force to be reckoned with, whether they seek to protect their beloved woods or pursue their own inscrutable agendas.

The players are most likely to encounter the crone witches when exploring in or near the wilds they call home. They may be trying to traverse the territory of a crone while evading her wrath, break a curse she has inflicted, or seek her aid in curing a supernatural ailment or combating a greater threat. Along the way, the players may have to confront the various forces of the wilds crones use as their minions, whether they be beasts, humans, bound monstrosities, or summoned elementals of nature.

## Running Woodland Crone Adventures

The setting you're running your adventures in will help determine the background of the crone witches and how they fit into your world. They may be wise women and spiritual leaders of a specific people who live in or near the wilds, or they may have their own order that exists outside the structure of any other society or civilization. Alternatively, they may not even be a part of any order, and each crone is an individual actor mastering her powers outside any formal structure or organization. 

Regardless of the specifics, there are some commonalities between crones and the minions that serve them, regardless of the setting:

* **Tied to the Wilds:** Crones and their servants are all intimately connected to the wilderness where they dwell most of the time. They generally only emerge from the wilds to unleash their wrath on a predetermined target. Any who threaten their homes or the spirits who dwell there will quickly become such targets. 

* **Morally Ambiguous:** Like the wilderness they dwell in, the crones and their minions are subjects of fear and reverence and are seen as a source of life and healing as well as danger and the unknown. Sometimes, crone witches serve as intermediaries between villages and the spirit world, and other times, they serve as conduits for the malevolent forces of the wild. 

* **Protective & Vengeful:** Regardless of their alignment, crones and the forces that serve them are extremely protective of the wilds they call home. They are unforgiving towards trespassers and harbor deadly grudges against any who threaten the land they protect.

### Crone Witch Motivations
The short and long-term motivations of crone witches and their ilk almost always focus on the protection of the wilds they call home. This protection can take on the noble form of stopping those who would defile the wilds, or it can involve more sinister means, such as cursing travelers or entire villages to enable the unimpeded spread of their domain at the expense of the civilization. Other times, it could involve crones ruthlessly gathering dark power they believe is needed to secure their homes against threats.

When role-playing crone witches, a good starting point can be to think of them as eccentric and overly protective grandmothers whose connection to the spirit world makes them wise but often strange and unpredictable. Sometimes, they can come across as a mix of a protective druid and a hag. Their plans are often difficult for those without mystic knowledge to understand, making their next moves difficult for others to anticipate.

#### Common Crone Witch Motivations
* Destroy Intruders
* Protect or Reclaim Wilderness
* Cleanse Corruption from Wilderness
* Curse Those Seen as Threats
* Exact Revenge On Enemies
* Gather (Potentially Dark) Power
* Appease Spirits of the Wild


### Tactics of the Crone Witch Forces
The combat tactics for crone witches and each of their minions are described along with each individual creature's description later in this document. When they operate together as part of a larger force, they utilize their stealth skills and ability to navigate difficult forest terrain to ambush players. If they're losing a fight outside their forest home, they will often retreat back to the safety of the woods, but when defending their woodland homes, particularly sacred sites and shrines, the crones and their forces often fight to the death.

# New Spells

## Lore of Beasts
This brand of magic draws on the power of the wilds and the animals that inhabit them. Those who practice it avoid civilization and live hermitic lives in the savage and untamed wilderness. Their magic harnesses the power of the beasts they dwell alongside, often by summoning wild spirits or unleashing the inner savagery of themselves and others to transform them into primeval creatures. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Beasts often wield.

#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

<br><br>


#### Aspect of the Beast

*4th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

#### Bestial Spirit

*4th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

#### Call of the Pack

*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Ranger
___

Unleashing a primal howl, you stir the wild fervor within your allies. You and up to three other creatures you are aware of within range that can hear you are quickened until the start of your next turn. While quickened this way, these creatures gain advantage on attack rolls against any enemy if at least one of their allies is within 5 feet of that enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### Impenetrable Pelt

*5th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1  action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a tuft of fur)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You weave magic to sheathe a willing creature you can see within range in a layer of tough fur and hide. For the spell's duration, any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the target takes is reduced by 5. This reduction applies before any resistances.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage reduction increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

 <img src='https://i.ibb.co/2cTRzC2/Spirit-of-the-Aldergard-Kaldheim-Mt-G-Art.jpg' style='position:absolute;right:-50px;top:-90px;width:1100px;transform:scaleX(1)' />

style='position:absolute;right:-280px;top:105px;height:1400px;width:1416px;transform:rotate(170deg)' />

\pagebreakNum



#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

\columnbreak

#### Primal Dominance

*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  10 minutes
- **Classes:**   Bard, Druid, Ranger
___

You emanate a commanding presence, compelling a primal creature to submit. Choose a beast, monstrosity, giant, dragon, or fey within range that can see and hear you. If the creature's Intelligence is 8 or higher, the spell has no effect. Otherwise, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes charmed and frightened by you until the end of your next turn. Regardless of the save's outcome, you gain a +5 bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) and Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with that creature until the spell concludes.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.




#### Summon Flock

*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V, S, M (A worm or bug)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon casting, you summon three crows that circle above you for the duration of the spell. As a bonus action, you can direct one of the crows to dive at a creature or object within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 2d4 piercing damage. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is blinded until the start of your next turn. Regardless of the outcome, the directed crow is expended. The spell ends if all crows are expended. For each crow circling above you, you gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.


***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot or higher, you summon an additional crow for each slot level above 1st.

#### Wild Surge

*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (a tuft of fur and a fang)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Select a willing creature within range to tap into its primal nature, transforming it into a bestial form. For the duration of the spell, the creature receives the following benefits:

<br>

* It gains 20 temporary hit points.

## Lore of Crones
This ancient magic of the old world is utilized by the mystic crones who've safeguarded the lore and passed it down through the generations. It taps into the darker forces of nature, which can curse and undo enemies while aiding allies. Wielders of this magic can conjure concoctions that burn enemies and heal allies, summon groves that hinder foes and protect friends, and deal out blessings and curses as they see fit. While the crones have kept the knowledge of spells to themselves, understanding of their use has crept out across the world, and they are sometimes utilized by other spellcasters who've delved into the dark lore of the old world.

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> The creature is consumed by bloodlust, giving it the following effects:
> * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear. 
> * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.



> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid. 
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.



> ##### Notes on 2024 Burning Rules
> If you're using the rules for burning described in the 2024 edition of D&D, these are the changes that were made in this document:
> * **Sources of Burning Don't Stack.** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
> * **Damage At End of Turn.** Burning damage occurs at the end of a creature's turn rather than the beginning. This gives the creature the chance to try to end the condition before taking the damage, thus giving players more agency when they start burning.

## Lore of Death

This brand of magic plays on the nature of mortality and fragility of life, though it is strictly distinct from traditional necromancy, as it embraces the inevitability of death rather than attempting to deny it.

The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Death often wield.

A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

You target a creature you can see within range, causing it to collapse into debilitating fits of deranged laughter. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less aren't affected.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration, any creature within 30 feet of the laughing creature that can hear the laughter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the laughing creature until the end of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it stabilizes but remains laughing and can no longer attempt saving throws against the spell. If the spell ends while the creature has 0 hit points, it dies.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

On a failed save, the creature is petrified for the duration. At the end of <br> each of its turns, the target can make another <br> Constitution saving throw. On a success, the <br> spell ends on the target. However, if a creature <br> accumulates three failed saves against this <br> spell (including the initial failed save), it <br> remains petrified indefinitely until the <br> condition is cured by other means.

If a petrified creature is physically <br> damaged or broken during this state, it <br> will manifest the same damage upon <br> being reverted to its original form.

That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

The creature must be no more than one size category larger than you. The spell fails if either of you would appear in a space that cannot accommodate your size.

#### Mystifying Miasma
*2nd-level illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Ranger, Bard
___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 


 This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Penumbral Pendulum
*4th-level illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You conjure a spectral pendulum that swings through a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, and 5-foot-tall line of your choice within range. Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot.

#### Pit of Shadows
*6th-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black cloth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

#### Shroud of Dusk
*1st-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (A drop of pitch or piece of coal)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You release a surge of chilling shadows in a 15-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 1d10 cold damage, and on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The the line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.



#### Unseen Lurker
*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:**  Ranger
___

Choose a willing creature you can see within range. The chosen creature becomes enveloped in a shroud of mist, enabling it to move with unseen swiftness. Until the start of your next turn, the creature's movement speed is doubled, it's quickened, and it becomes invisible along with everything it's wearing or carrying.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 3rd.

#### Withering Resolve
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard
___

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

# New Creatures

## Avatar of Beasts

From the echoing roars of ancient beasts to the silent stalk of the predator, nature begets a power all its own, an unchecked and relentless force. It is this raw, untamed energy that gives birth to an elemental known as an avatar of beasts, enigmatic entities born from the very soul of the wilderness.

**Primeval Visage.** These towering creatures walk upon the land with long, powerful strides. Their body is a blend of various animal spirits, giving them an almost unpredictable look, though most are bipedal with a vaguely humanoid body shape. A constant is their skull-like head adorned with antlers that rise like darkened spires. Eyes, pools of haunting luminescence, observe the world with primal intensity. Their vast hooved feet, capable of pulverizing any caught in their step, and their supernatural claws, an embodiment of nature's fury, are weapons of unparalleled savagery. With each individual avatar drawing upon various primal animal spirits, no two are exactly alike. One might have the scales of a serpent intermixed with the fur of a lion, while another might possess the feathery mantle and claws of an eagle combined with the armored hide of a rhino.

**Veil of the Wilds.** Despite their daunting size, avatars of beasts possess an uncanny ability to meld with the wilderness. They move through forests, mountains, and swamps as if they were phantoms, impervious to natural barriers and ever-prepared to ambush the unwary. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Their harmony with nature allows them to bypass any plant obstructions their forest homes might impose, making them almost impossible to anticipate.

**Supernatural Savagery.** In battle, these elementals are a spectacle of raw might and eldritch power. While their natural weapons—claws, antlers, and hooves—are deadly enough, their supernatural abilities add another level of terror. They can summon flocks of relentless birds whose sharp talons and beaks dive upon foes with murderous intent, often blinding their victims. When their foes amass to charge them head-on, avatars of beasts are even known to unleash rays of eerie and deadly supernatural light, thought to be the essence of the magic that makes up their being.

**Summoning the Beast.** While these elementals are free spirits of the wild, there are those with the knowledge to call upon them. Druids, shamans, and other mystics of the wilderness, in times of sheer desperation, might perform ancient and savage rituals to summon these mighty beings. These ceremonies are not to be taken lightly, often demanding a primeval sacrifice, where the essence of the wild is offered in exchange for the avatar's aid.

>
> ***Crashing Charge.*** If the avatar moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 11 (2d10) damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The creature makes the saving throw with disadvantage if the attack was made using its Bestial Take Down bonus action.
>
> ***One with the Wild.*** The avatar has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena and can do so when only lightly obscured. Additionally, the avatar can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them, and can move through trees as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 10 force damage if it ends its turn inside a tree.
>
> ***Primal Senses.*** The avatar has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on the checks in areas that are lightly obscured.
>
> ***Talons of the Forest.*** When the avatar makes an attack, it ignores half and three-quarters cover provided by foliage.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The avatar makes two attacks.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage.
>
> ***Savage Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) for each time this turn the target has already been hit with its Talon attack this turn.
>
> ***Pulverizing Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a prone creature, it cannot stand up until the end of the avatar's next turn unless it uses its action to succeed on a DC 20 Constitution check.
>
> ***Amber Breath (1/day).*** The avatar exhales amber light in a 60-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creatures gain no benefit from cover given by foliage for this saving throw.
>
> ***Flock of Doom.*** The avatar fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 100 feet of it with shadowy crows. The avatar can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by the crows. The sphere spreads around corners, and it lasts until the avatar uses the ability again, is more than 100 feet away from the area, or loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The sphere's area is difficult terrain, and creatures in it have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. At the end of each of the avatar's turns, each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 15 (6d4) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is surprised. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 8), it is blinded until the end of the avatar's next turn. On each of the avatar's turns, the avatar may move the crows 50 feet in any direction (no action required). Using this ability does not reveal the avatar if it is hidden from a creature.
> 
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Howl of the Great Beast (1/day).*** The avatar lets out a primeval howl. The avatar can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by it. Each affected creature within 120 feet of it that can hear it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes frightened of the avatar. The creature can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the avatar by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. At the end of its turn, the creature repeats the Wisdom save, ending the effect on it on a success.
>
> ***Bestial Take Down.*** The avatar makes one weapon attack. After the attack, the avatar falls prone. If it has 90 or fewer hit points, the attack is made with advantage.

\pagebreakNum

### Avatar of Beasts Tactics
Avatars of Beasts are ambush predators and experts at stealthily navigating woodland environments to attack from optimal hidden positions. Knocking enemies prone will be their primary tactic throughout the fight as it allows them to stack successive talon attacks on a single target more easily. The avatar never flees from combat unless directed to by someone controlling it.

#### Special Abilities

&emsp;**Flock of Doom.** The avatar generally uses this ability at the start of the fight, ideally before it's even spotted by the players. The avatar will stay hidden for as long as possible while withering away the players with the flock. The avatar will only charge into combat if it manages to blind a vulnerable player it can reach, or one of the players spot it. While the flock is active during combat, the avatar will position it to hinder ranged attackers. 

**Amber Breath.** This ability is deployed when the avatar can hit three or more targets simultaneously. 

#### Attack Sequence

The avatar's primary targets are those blinded by its flock and any vulnerable prey it can reach. The target's distance and whether it's prone affects how the avatar will attack.<br><br>

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Available.** 
* The avatar uses Howl of the Great Beast.
* It then closes the distance and makes a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If finishes with a stomp attack.

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Not Available.** 
* The avatar uses its Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If it manages to knock the target prone, it will follow up with two stomp attacks; otherwise, it will make two talon attacks.

**Targets Beyond 60ft.**
* The avatar dashes to its target.
* The avatar uses the Bestial Take Down bonus action to make a gore attack.
* The avatar stands back up.
Note, if the avatar lacks the remaining movement to stand back up, it will be unlikely to use Bestial Takedown and leave itself vulnerable.

**Targets Already Prone.**
* The avatar attacks with two talon attacks.
* If both attacks hit, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make another talon attack.
* If any of the attacks miss, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a stomp attack.

### Avatar of Beasts Loot
Because these creatures are elementals, they don't have flesh and blood like mundane other creatures, and most of their body disintegrates when they die. Amidst the smokey ashes they leave behind, players may be able to salvage some bone or hide that remained corporeal or even some of their magical essence before it evaporates. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Avatar of Beasts Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Avatar of Beasts Loot Table
| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |

## Bane Wolves

Deep within the ancient groves and <br> the silent, enveloping darkness of primeval <br> woodlands, lurk creatures whose very presence <br> chills the blood of seasoned warriors and sows <br> dread in the heart of travelers. These are the bane <br> wolves, monstrous predators that are the stuff of legends.

***Physical Appearance.*** Their haunting visage is a grotesque fusion of wolf and the undead. A skull-like face, stark white and cruelly mocking in its semblance to death, gazes out with eyes that burn with a hunger that's more than just physical. These beasts, larger than any natural wolf, possess claws so strong and sharp that they can easily pin their prey, leaving them helpless before delivering the fatal bite. Their huge fangs, reminiscent of ancient drakes or behemoths, are not just for display. When their jaws close in on vulnerable prey, these fangs eviscerate their victim, often killing them instantly.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



***Hunting Tactics.*** A bane wolf is not one to announce its presence prematurely. It stalks, often in a pack. With patient and deliberate intent, it traverses the dark woods, moving like a shadow against the midnight canvas. Any creature wandering carelessly in their territory is at risk of becoming prey to a sneak attack. Before one even senses danger, a pack of bane wolves might be right upon them, poised to strike.

&emsp;***Mysterious Origins.*** Where these abominations came from is a question that has baffled scholars and hunters alike. The most widely accepted theory is that they are the result of the mutating energies of chaos, an otherworldly and malevolent force that touches the very essence of a creature, reshaping it into something far more sinister.

***The Dark Bindings.*** There are those with knowledge, dark and forbidden, who have learned to bind these creatures to their will. Among them, the crones of the northern forests are particularly notorious. With incantations whispered in the dead of night and sacrifices made under the crescent moon, they can summon bane wolves, bending their savage wills to serve as monstrous soldiers.

***The Dark Bloods.*** If the bane wolves weren’t terrifying enough, there exists a cursed variant known as the dark bloods. The bites of these monsters hold a danger beyond the physical. Any victim bitten by a dark blood faces a fate potentially worse than death. They are infected with a curse which transforms them into a bane wolf and threatens their free will. The transformation is as much psychological as it is physical, as the newly transformed wrestle with dark instincts threatening to overtake their very identity. Those who manage to resist, to hold onto that last shred of their self, can eventually repel the curse, returning to their original form. But many are not so fortunate. Those who succumb are lost forever, their old identities consumed, leaving behind only the ravenous creature of the night.

### The Bane Wolf Curse
&emsp;**Dark Transformation.** A creature afflicted with the Bane Wolf Curse is immediately subjected to a dark transformation into a bane wolf. The creature adopts the statistics of a bane wolf, with the following exceptions: it retains its original hit points, hit dice, and Constitution score. The creature's alignment and personality remain unchanged. 

\columnbreak

Any equipment the creature was using or wearing drops to the ground at its current location, and for the duration of the transformation, the creature cannot interact with or benefit from its dropped equipment. Additionally, it cannot speak, cast spells, or perform any action requiring hands or speech.

**Dark Instincts.** At the start of each of its turns, the creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its psyche is overcome by the darkness within until the start of its next turn. During this time, it suffers from the following effects:

* It perceives all non-Balewolf creatures as enemies and all Balewolfs as allies until the start of its next turn.

* If there is a non-Balewolf creature within its reach, it must use the Attack action against the nearest one.

* If there are no creatures within its reach, it uses the Dash action to approach the nearest non-Balewolf creature it is aware of.



**Ending the Curse.** Should the creature succeed on this saving throw three times, the curse is lifted, and it reverts back to its original form. However, if the creature fails the save three times, the transformation becomes permanent. The creature then adopts the maximum hit points and Constitution score of a Balewolf, becomes an NPC under the DM's control.



Casting *dispel evil and good* or *remove curse* within the first hour of the transformation can reverse the curse. After this initial hour, only *dispel evil and good* or *remove curse*  spells cast at 9th level, the *wish* spell, or divine intervention can restore the creature to its original form.

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Bane Wolf Bounty:** The local lord has issued a challenge: rid the northern forests of the bane wolves, which have been attacking travelers and trade caravans. The reward is substantial, but rumors suggest that a previous group of hunters never returned.|
|  2  | **The Crone's Pack:** A child has gone missing in the woods, and the only clue left behind is a single bane wolf's paw print. The adventurers must venture deep into the forest to rescue the child, only to discover an old crone manipulating the bane wolves for her own dark purposes.|

### Bane Wolf Tactics

&emsp;**Initiating Combat.**
These are ambush-oriented creatures, using darkness and woodland cover to make their sneak attacks. They will patiently stalk prey until they see the opportunity to attack from stealth and surprise their victims.

**When to Retreat.**
Once bane wolves initiate their attack, they will only retreat when being commanded by another more powerful creature. Otherwise, they will fight to the death and relentlessly pursue fleeing players.


**Getting Advantage on Vicious Bite.**
In combat, the bane wolf's tactics revolve around it getting advantage on its bite attack to increase the odds of getting a crit with it. There are a few ways they can go about securing advantage:

* Utilizing their Pack Tactics
* Attacking from a hidden position
* Focusing their bites on a single target until they can knock it prone and pin it with their claws

**Working As a Pack.**
When bane wolves are operating as a pack, they instinctively hunt down the physically weakest player, relentlessly attacking until one of the bane wolves has the player prone and pinned. They will then move from player to player, repeating this process until they are all pinned, or there are only two bane wolves left. The remaining two bane wolves will then focus on the player closest to death. 

#### Dark Bloods
The key difference between these bane wolves and their "ordinary" kin is the curse they can inflict with their bite. There are some key strategies to keep in mind when cursing players:

* Prioratize attacking non-cursed players over cursed players to spread the curse to as many players as possible. Only focus on cursed players when they are doing something very disruptive, like pinning a bane wolf with their claws or scoring a critical hit on it.

* Cursed players who've lost control for a round and are attacking their allies can be used to trigger the bane wolf's Pack Tactics ability since they are momentarily on the same side.

### Bane Wolves Loot
The valuable items looted from cold ones will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a bane wolf. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Bane Wolf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Crone Witches
In the depths of the primeval woods, where shadows dance with the ethereal whispers of the past, the crone witches have carved out their existence. These mysterious women are an enigma, both protectors of the ancient ways and potential agents of darkness.

Crone witches, with the weight of ages upon them, appear as supernaturally aged and grizzled women. Their long, tangled hair often interweaves with the very elements of the forests they call home. Around their necks, wrists, and waists, they adorn themselves with primeval witch charms, each with its own tale and power.

Deeply connected to the spirit world, these crones serve as wise women, their eyes perceiving the unseen and their voices communing with the spirits. While some offer their guidance to remote rural communities, others opt for solitude, living as hermits amidst the thickets and glades.
Those who live near or even alongside these crones are torn between respect and trepidation. To the rural folks, they are indispensable spiritual leaders and guides in times of uncertainty. However, to more "civilized" individuals, these crones are often seen with suspicion and distrust, their primal ways misunderstood and feared.

For all the good they might offer, the crone witches dance a dangerous line. The spirits they commune with are not always benevolent, and some crones find themselves seduced by darker entities, leading them to pursue more nefarious goals.

Beyond their spellcasting prowess, the crones hold the ability to beseech the spirits to inflict curses upon their enemies. From causing physical frailty to fraying one's mind, their curses are both varied and potent.

When crones come together, forming secretive covens, they are led by the eldest among them. These leaders, bearing the title of "Mother," are reservoirs of ancient knowledge and power, their decisions shaping the actions of their coven. They alone possess the power to channel dark spirits through their body in times of need to become wicked avatars of the vengeful forest known as Ancient Widows.
Covens often form deep, mystical bonds with specific forests. This bond allows them to tap into the very essence of the land, drawing strength from its spirits and sharing the mystic powers that the forest bestows.

With mere whispers, the crones can call upon the creatures of the woods. From simple animals like ravens and wolves to the more monstrous denizens of the deep forest, these beings serve the crones, driven by an unseen bond.
In times of great conflict, the crones take to the battlefield in chariots, atop which sit their magical cauldrons which serve as a focus for their eldritch power. Pulled by mystic woodland harts, these chariots provide not only mobility but also protection, allowing the crones to unleash devastating curses upon their adversaries.

### Boons of the Forest

Crones can invoke the power of the ancient forests they protect to call upon powerful boons. One or more crones may be tied to the same forest this way, granting them access to the same boons.

While a crone is within the forest she's tied to, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), she can take a lair action to invoke one of the boons described below. Once a crone uses one of the effects, it can't be used again by any crone in the forest for the next hour. Only one crone can invoke the power of the forest this way each round. Each boon a crone has access to increases her CR by 2.

Each boon gains its power from a specific Large object or creature within the forest. If such an object is destroyed or creature killed, the crones lose the ability to use that boon. A forest controlled by one more crones could have multiple objects or creatures that each provide access to a boon.

Examples of these objects or creatures could include:
* A large totem or stone marker
* An ancient tree
* A powerful beast that lives in the woods
* One of the crones herself

#### Crone Witch Boons

&emsp;***Bewitching Lure.*** The crone targets any number of creatures she is aware of within 120 feet. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become charmed by the crone until the end of its next turn. While charmed in this way, the creature must use the Dash action to move toward the crone by the safest available route unless it has nowhere to move.

***Chant of Purification.*** The crone selects a point within 120 feet that she can see. For each creature within 60 feet of that point, the crone can end one disease, curse, or one of the following conditions afflicting it: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

***Grasping Forest.*** Foliage reaches out to grasp any creatures of the crone's choosing that she is aware of within 120 feet. Any chosen creature within 5 feet of a plant must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by entangling roots and vines. While restrained, the creature can't teleport or use extradimensional or interplanar means of travel. The restraint can be ended if the creature or another creature that can reach it uses an action to make a DC 15 Strength check to rip away the plants. The entangling plants wither away after 1 minute.

***Jinxed Land.*** The crone, any chariot she is riding, and any number of willing creatures within 15 feet of her are teleported to a spot within 5 feet of a tree within 100 feet. Any creature teleported this way becomes invisible until the start of its next turn.


***Wild Spirit.*** The crone summons a spirit with the stats of a Cave Bear at a point within 60 feet of her. The summoned creature acts as an ally to the crone and her companions. It acts on initiative count 19. It obeys any verbal commands given by the crone (no action required). If no commands are given, it attacks any hostile creatures within its line of sight. The bear vanishes after one minute.

> ***Pushed.***  A creature can attune to the sled as a magic item. When a creature riding the sled that is attuned to it casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to have the sled maintain concentration on the spell in its stead. The sled only loses concentration if it is destroyed, if it starts concentrating on a new spell, or if the attuned creature is either dead or moves more than 60 feet from the sled.

If the chariot or its steeds end their turn within the creature's space, the creature becomes restrained. While restrained this way, the affected creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 12 Strength check to try to free it. On a success, the restrained creature is moved to an unoccupied space of its choosing within 5 feet of the chariot and is no longer restrained.
>
> ***Winter Thicket Runner.*** The sled and its steeds are unaffected by non-magical, difficult terrain. Additionally, they can traverse through plants and ice without being slowed, grappled, restrained, knocked prone, or taking damage from thorny, spiky, or other hazardous plant features.
>
>
> ### Steed Actions
>
> ***Freezing Charge.*** When a steed moves at least 20 feet in a straight line, it can then make a melee weapon attack against each creature it's facing within 5 feet. On a hit, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) cold damage. If this attack knocks a target prone, ice forms around the target, restraining it for 1 minute. The restrained creature, or another creature within its reach, can use an action to break the ice and end the restrained condition.

### Crones' Huts
Birthed from the mystical mastery of The Crone Grandmother, the crone's huts stand as legendary embodiments of the woodland's might and the mystical power of the crones. Towering on colossal chicken legs, these huts are more than mere dwellings; they're animated entities with a semblance of life. Adorned with elements of the forest, their windows gleam eerily like living eyes, and their structure can produce haunting melodies.

\columnbreak

<br>

These huts serve as mobile sanctuaries, effortlessly relocating to keep their crone inhabitants safe. Their natural camouflage lets them meld with the forest surroundings, becoming nearly invisible. If threatened, they can ruthlessly stomp and punt would-be intruders. The creation of such a hut requires immense power and elaborate rituals, binding the crone's essence to the dwelling. Once bound, the hut obeys the crone's every command and desire, becoming an extension of her will. Should the crone perish, the hut may go on a vengeful rampage or simply become dormant as its will slowly fades away.

>
> ***Bound.*** The hut is magically bound to a creature. As long as the hut and the creature are on the same plane of existence, the creature can telepathically call the hut to it, and the hut knows the distance and direction of the creature. If a creature inside the hut casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to have the hut maintain concentration on the spell in its stead. The hut doesn't make concentration saving throws unless the damage that would force the save is from a critical hit.
>
> ***Extradimensional Walls.*** Creatures can't teleport into the hut unless it allows them to. Additionally, creatures with incorporeal movement or similar abilities can't move through its walls. The walls also extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The hut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
>
> ***Interior.*** A Large or smaller creature can spend all its movement to enter inside the hut or leave it, or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the hut is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter. If the hut succeeds, the creature can't enter. Any movement it used to try to enter is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. 
> 
> The interior is a 15-foot-square space. While a creature is inside the hut, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the hut. Any attack that hits the hut from the inside is a critical hit.
>
> ***Sure-Footed.*** The hut has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone or move it against its will.
>
> ***Warded Home.*** The hut and creatures inside it have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects originating from outside the hut. Additionally, creatures in the hut are shielded against divination magic, as though protected by a *nondetection* spell.
>
> ***Woodland Stalker.*** The hut has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage. Additionally, the hut can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The hut makes two *Pinning Claw* attacks and uses *Expel*. It can replace one of its *Pinning Claw* with a *Punt* attack as long it is not grappling two or more creatures.
>
> ***Pinning Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not inside the hut. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled. The hut has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Punt.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not inside the hut or grappled by it. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away. It has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is prone. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 11), it is pushed 40 feet away instead.
>
> ***Expel.*** The hut spins and attempts to force a number of creatures of its choice inside it to leave. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be thrown anywhere between 20 to 40 feet away (the hut's choice). If the thrown target would hit another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be hit, taking 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage and becoming prone. On a successful save, the creature dodges and takes no damage.

### Crone Witch Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these menacing witches in your games:

##### Crone Witch Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Wandering Children:** Children from a nearby village have started disappearing, with the last seen heading towards the woods. Rumors circulate that a crone witch has been seen in the vicinity. Is she responsible, or is there a deeper mystery at play?|
|  2  | **The Crone's Cure:** A deadly disease has struck a city, and the only known cure is a potion brewed by a crone witch. The party is tasked with venturing into the forest, locating the crone, and obtaining the remedy.|
|  3  |**The Crone's Curse:** A local lord has been cursed by a crone after he desecrated a sacred grove. The party is hired either to lift the curse or to convince the crone to do so. |
|  4  | **Mother's Conclave:** Every few decades, the crone mothers from different covens gather for a secretive conclave. Rumors suggest they plan to summon a powerful spirit entity. The party can either aid or hinder their ritual. |
|  5  | **Darkness Beckons:** A coven of crones, swayed by dark spirits, is amassing power, threatening both the balance of the forests and the neighboring lands. The party must either join forces with benevolent crones or confront this dark coven head-on.  |
|  6  | **The Crone's Quarral:** The party finds themselves caught in a feud between three crones. The have the option to join forces with one of the crones and gain her blessings, but doing so causes the other two to unite against them.|

<br>

> ##### Designer's Note: Player Incentives
> If you're running an adventure where the players are exploring woods controlled by multiple crones, having various objects imbued with hexes can provide players with additional objectives to destroy these objects, making their journey through the woods easier. Alternatively, you may have the players assist the crones in their battle against the foreign threat. In this case, the crones could grant the players permission to use the hexes while they travel through the woods.

### Crone Witch Tactics

These tactics focus on how crones riding sleds drawn by 2 harts will fight. The tactics will vary significantly if the crone doesn't have a sled, and it is important the crone has the support of minions in such situations, as a lone crone is highly vulnerable and unlikely to last long in a fight.

#### Crone's Sled
While riding her sled, the crone employs hit-and-run strategies, utilizing her harts to ram into vulnerable targets.

The sled's Hexed Cauldron ability allows it to maintain concentration on a spell for the crone. This enables her to maintain two spells that require concentration at once. Typically, the crone assigns her most powerful spell to her sled as it retains concentration unless destroyed.

#### Ancient Widow Form
Crone mothers transform into Ancient Widows when reduced to half health or less, enhancing their melee combat abilities. Despite this transformation, they do not become full-fledged frontline fighters and shouldn't be recklessly thrown into melee combat.

<img src='https://i.postimg.cc/qq8Lks1K/caio-monteiro-413390-witch-of-the-moors.jpg' style='position:absolute; bottom:-31px; right:-133px; width:920px; transform: scaleX(1)' />

\pagebreakNum

#### Crones of Beasts
Because many of these crones' spells have a duration of an hour, and they have ways to maintain several of them at once, crones of beasts can be significantly more dangerous if they have time to prepare for a fight. 

**Wild Heart Trait.** This trait, when coupled with the crone riding on a sled, enables her to maintain concentration on three spells simultaneously, with the harts being prime targets for her spells. 

**Craven Scent Curse.** This curse is best targeted at frontline fighters.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Impenetrable Pelt.** The crone casts this defensive spell on herself to bolster her survivability.

**Bestial Spirit.** The summoned spirit should be positioned next to melee fighters possessing low Dexterity or targets slow enough that they can't outrun the Bestial Spirit.

**Elarge/Reduce.** This spell works well with the Wild Heart trait and should target the crone's most formidable minion or herself while she is in Ancient Widow Form and has lost concentration on Impenetrable Pelt.

**Amber Spear.** This spell is particularly effective when it can hit three targets simultaneously (or at least two targets with low Dexterity).

**Summon Flock.** This spell is generally a lower priority among the crone's concentration spells. It's mostly useful when the crone doesn't have access to Impenetrable Pelt or she's scouting for enemies within her forest domain. The spell inflicts minimal damage, and its primary utility lies in disrupting the concentration of opposing spell casters.

#### Lore of The Crone
Crones adept in this lore work best alongside skirmishers, disrupting foes and slowly damaging them to outlast opponents.

**Fate of Interlopers.** The crone lures opponents into *forbidden grove*, positioning allies to hide within after attacking.

**Dampening Curse.** Targets a backline spellcaster, forcing them to move closer to the frontline.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies

&emsp;**Bountiful Cauldron.** Cast immediately, targeting creatures near each other and allies, especially those with low Dexterity.


**Blessing and Curse of the Ancients.** Cast right after *bountiful cauldron*. The curse targets a creature nearest to her allies, while the blessing targets her strongest ally (or herself if no allies are notably strong).


**Forbidden Grove.** Cast on the same turn as a bonus action spell. The crone places the grove between herself and enemies, forcing melee combatants to move through the area. It can also serve as an escape when targeted by spells.


**Incantation of Mania and Madness.** Targeted at backline spellcasters or groups of three or more


**Witch's broth and Brew .** Cast after other spells, prioritizing healing damaged allies unless there is a low Dexterity target within reach.

\columnbreak

#### Crones of Death
Crones adept in this lore of magic typically reserve their more potent spells for later combat stages.

**Life Leech Trait.** Crones start off with their lower-level spells to ramp up the bonus from this trait. They will then leverage their increased power to maximize their most powerful spells.

**Inversus Curse.** This curse should target a creature with low Charisma and Wisdom, who will then become a prime target for the crone's single-target spells.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Aspect of Dread.** This is a potent opening spell forcing multiple targets to make saving throws, thereby fueling the Life Leech trait. Beware that this spell can also affect allies.

**Impending Doom.** This is best used against a target marked with the Inversus curse. The crone can then follow this up with an assault by her harts and sled to take advantage of its poor saving throws.

**Spirit Leech.** Use this spell against creatures maked with the Inversus curse target before the crone's hit points drop to half so the temporary hit points gained don't cancel out any she will get from her Survivor or Ancient Widow trait.

**Crippling Pain.** Cast this on either the Inversus-cursed target or a creature encased in ice by the Freezing Charge ability of the harts.

**Horrifying Laughter.** Cast upon the Inversus-cursed target once the Life Leech trait has enhanced the crone's saving throws by +2.

#### Crones of Shadow
More than any other type of crone, crones of shadow depend on their minions to be effective.

**Shadow Paths.** The crone will only use this ability to leave her sled if the sled becomes immobilized. The minion she swaps places with will be charged with restoring the sled's mobility. Once mobile again, the crone will swap back to reassume her position on the sled.

**Harrowing Coil .** Deploy Harrowing Coil on agile skirmishers such as rogues or monks.


##### Spell-Casting Hierarchy
&emsp;**Pit of Shadows.** Prioritize casting this spell on two or more targets with below-average Dexterity.

**Withering Resolve or Penumbral Pendulum.** Opt for penumbral pendulum if it can hit two or more targets or an immobilized target that will be struck again by the pendulum on the subsequent turn.
Alternatively, cast withering resolve on the target with the lowest Wisdom saving throw. Follow up with a charge using the crone's harts to exploit the attacks now made with advantage.

**Mystifying Miasma.** Cast when two or more targets can be hit, with one of them being under the effects of Harrowing Coil, so the conjured shadows inflict extra damage to the cursed creature.

**Shroud of Dusk or Unseen Lurker.** Use Shroud of Dusk when it can hit two or more targets. Unseen Lurker serves as an escape tool or an alternative attack facilitator for the crone. It's particularly effective when used in the crone's Ancient Widow Form to hide her actions or position.

\pagebreakNum


### Crone's Hut Tactics
The crone's hut is created by and loyal to the crones and dutifully carries out any command they give it. Its primary function is safeguarding a crone's magical items or the crone herself. When occupied by a crone, the hut transforms into a mobile fortress, offering protection and mobility.
Despite its formidable presence, the hut tends to avoid direct confrontations with creatures that have high Strength and Athletics scores. The risk lies in these foes being able to break inside the hut and either harm the crone within or inflict damage on the hut from the inside out. Instead, the hut prioritizes targeting those with less Strength.

#### Combat Tactics
The hut prioritizes attacking two creatures within 30 feet of each other. This tactic allows it to utilize its pinning claw attacks without needing to move and allows it to grapple two adversaries simultaneously.

If the hut begins its turn with a melee-focused enemy grappled, it will use an attack to punt the enemy away to maintain distance.

#### Special Expel Combos

&emsp;**Punt and Expel Combo:** If the hut has an enemy grappled, it can punt that creature and then swiftly expel another creature from inside itself 
toward the enemy it just punted.

**Expel, Claw, Punt Combo:** If the hut doesn't have any adversaries grappled, it can approach an expelled creature, lash out with a claw attack, and subsequently punt the creature away.

### Crone Witch Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from crone witches come in the form of items they wear or carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Crone Witch Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## The Crone Grandmother

Whispered tales of darkness and caution, shared by the crackling fire or told to frightful children in their beds, often speak of The Crone Grandmother. She is a figure looming large in the folklore of countless civilizations. Those who have truly crossed her path know her not merely as a tale, but as a force of nature, one that they'd rather forget.

Her visage is as haunting as the stories suggest. Many say she resembles a decrepit old woman, bent but unbroken by her countless years. Her skin is sallow, riddled with the markings of the arcane. Eyes as deep as the darkest forest pools seem to hold eons of knowledge and wrath, while long, bony fingers end in sharpened claws. The Grandmother's gnarled form is adorned with trinkets and fetishes of old, her raiment crafted from the very creatures of the woods she calls home. 

It is said she emerged from the deepest corners of the ancient woodlands. As the guardian of her homeland, her power is intimately tied to it. Any who would dare harm her cherished woods would find themselves cursed by her magic. This isn't just any curse; it's a blight that seeps into one's very essence, causing their talents and strengths to wane, followed by an inexorable ebbing of life itself.

Even as she withers her foes away, her own vigor is restored as she draws vitality from the very soil she protects.

Yet, for all her terrifying might, there exists an even darker form that she can assume. When pushed beyond her limits, she allows herself to be consumed by the primeval spirit known as the ancient widow. This spirit transforms her into a hulking monstrosity, towering over her foes. In this form, her claws brim with ancient curses, and her iron teeth, now grotesquely pronounced, can grind to emit a shrill, maddening noise that lays her enemies low.

But for all her terrifying reputation, one thing is clear. The Crone Grandmother is a guardian first and foremost, a protector of her sacred homeland. To those who would harm it, she is a nightmare incarnate. Yet, to those who show respect and tread lightly, she remains a distant myth, a story to be shared in hushed tones, a warning to heed. Respect the wilds, and the wilds will respect you. But cross the Crone Grandmother, and you may just find the tales to be terrifyingly real.

### Form of the Ancient Widow
When the Crone Grandmother would drop to 0 hit points or die, instead, her body begins twisting, twitching, and contorting as she becomes possessed by the Ancient Widow. The Crone Grandmother instantly changes into her Ancient Widow form in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of where her first form disappeared. Her initiative count doesn't change. 

When she has access to this ability, both her forms combined are treated as a CR 18 creature.

### The Crone Grandmother Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring the wisened grandmother in your games:

##### Crone Grandmother Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Blighted Land:** Crops are failing and livestock are dying in the nearby lands. The local leaders suspect that it is the work of The Crone Grandmother, cursing the lands for some unknown transgression. They seek the party's aid to negotiate with her or, if that fails, to put an end to her curse.|
|  2  | **Cursed Bloodline:** A local noble seeks the party's help after being cursed by The Crone Grandmother, causing their lineage to slowly transform into wild beasts. To break the curse, they must delve into the heart of the haunted woods, confront the crone, and unravel her reasons for enmity against the noble family.|
|  3  |**The Walking Hut:** Reports abound of a massive hut on chicken legs terrorizing remote settlements. Each attack corresponds with an ancient stone being stolen from the village. The adventurers must track down the hut, confront The Crone Grandmother who commands it, and uncover her plan involving these ancient stones. |
|  4  | **The Crones' Coup:** A rogue faction of crone witches, disapproving of the Grandmother’s methods, threatens to upend the balance of the forests. Reluctantly, she and the adventurers must come together to restore equilibrium. |

### The Crone Grandmother Tactics

&emsp;**Malediction of Ruin:** The crone's curse ensures her adversaries will gradually weaken and perish. When utilizing this curse effectively, she fights degrovesively, focusing on attrition to wear her enemies down.

#### Concentration Spells & Their Priority
&emsp;**Bountiful Cauldron:** The crone casts this spell as soon as possible, targeting creatures that are next to each other and prioritizing those with low Dexterity.

**Will of the Spirits:** Used when it can hit three or more targets or two targets with low Charisma saving throws. The crone will cast this spell twice on the same target if needed. She will also hit herself with the spell if necessary to affect all targets, intentionally choosing to fail the save.

**Incantation of Mania:** This spell targets backline spellcasters or hits three or more targets after using *will of the spirits*.

**Witch’s Broth and Brew:** Used when all other spells have been cast. The crone prioritizes healing herself as long as there is at least one target within reach that she can either heal or damage.

\columnbreak

#### Monstrous Actions

&emsp;**Wicked Assault:** The Crone moves away from melee fighters, using two spirit bolt attacks. If she cannot escape melee without taking significant damage, she makes two wild staff attacks to push away the nearest foe.

**Thicket Stride:** Used to escape melee combat when necessary. If already at a safe distance, she places the Forbidden Grove between herself and her primary adversary. If Bountiful Cauldron is not active, she uses a bonus action after casting spells to hide in the area.

#### Ancient Widow Form
The crone retains the same combat priorities as her standard form. Her overarching objective remains to prolong battles, allowing her Malediction of Ruin to erode her adversaries.

**Cursed Metal Claws:** Targets the most vulnerable foes, especially those suffering the greatest ability score reduction or who are stunned or restrained.

**Fury of the Land:** Targets three creatures most affected by the Malediction of Ruin.

**Countering Melee Denial:** If opponents are staying out of her melee range, the crone retaliates with her Bewitched Bolt attacks. Furthermore, she utilizes her legendary actions to employ the devastating Grinding Teeth ability to damage and knock foes prone, giving her a chance to close in on them.

### Crone Grandmother Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Crone Grandmother comes in the form of items she wears <Br> or carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

If the players are looting her hut for materials that were part of its construction, they could use Intelligence checks with the appropriate tools such as Carpenter's Tools or Woodcarver's Tools.

#### Crone Grandmother Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

**Garb of the Forest.** These warriors seamlessly blend into the woodland, donning clothing made from the very essence of the woods they call home.
Their attire is a blend of leather hides and animal pelts, interwoven with bones from prized kills and various other forest remnants, designed not only for camouflage but also as an homage to the spirits of the forest.

&emsp;**Shadowy Enforcers.** The woodland ambushers act as secretive scouts and enforcers operating outside any form of structured or traditional law. Employed to silently eliminate any threat to those they owe allegiance to, their reputation precedes them. An enemy marked by the ambushers seldom lives to tell the tale.

**Master Hunters.** Navigating the challenging terrain of the northern woods demands not just strength but also a unique understanding of the land. The ambushers are survivalists, trained from a young age in tracking, trapping, and hunting. They are equally known for their uncanny precision with the crossbow, a weapon they've mastered over countless years. Their shots, always taken from the shadows, strike their targets with pinpoint precision.

**Dark Allegiances.** While their skills often find them in the service of royalty, protecting borders or scouting enemy lines, the woodland ambushers also have a darker side to their allegiances. It's whispered that they serve the enigmatic dark crones of the woodlands. These mysterious figures, wielding ancient and arcane powers, often call upon the ambushers to enforce their will upon the woods.


**The Wolfhearts.** This elite unit of ambushers is revered and feared in equal measure. Not just satisfied with ranged combat, the Wolfhearts have honed the deadly art of close-quarters combat. With swift agility, they employ nets in battle, trapping and incapacitating foes before finishing them off with point-blank crossbow fire. Their emblem, a wolf's heart, is a symbol of  unmatched prowess and unyielding courage.

### Woodland Ambusher Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these elite hunters in your games:

##### Woodland Ambusher Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Wounded Ambusher:** While exploring the woods, the party stumbles upon a wounded ambusher. Helping him might earn the party a powerful ally in the forest, but it also draws them into the internal politics and feuds of the Ambushers.|
|  2  | **The Forbidden Ritual:** Whispers speak of a ritual the dark crones are planning to perform that could threaten the entire region. The Woodland Ambushers are divided on their stance. The party must decide whether to intervene and how best to navigate the conflicting loyalties of the Ambushers.|
|  3  |**The Hunter's Game:** The party, while traversing the woods, becomes the target of a deadly hunt organized by a rogue faction of Ambushers seeking to prove their prowess. The players must survive and turn the tables on their hunters. |
|  4  | **The Foul Forest Shrine:** A group of woodland ambushers have taken to worshipping a corrupted nature spirit, building a shrine to it deep in the forest. The players must find and destroy this shrine while dealing with the twisted ambushers who protect it. |
|  5  | **The Wolfheart's Vendetta:** A member of the elite Wolfhearts holds a personal grudge against one of the player characters or their allies. The party is constantly harassed and ambushed by the Wolfhearts, leading to a confrontation with this elite warrior.  |
|  6  | **The Crones' Deception:** The dark crones of the woods have manipulated the Ambushers into believing the party threatens their sacred sites. As a result, the party faces relentless attacks and must find a way to dispel this deception or confront the crones themselves.|

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Woodland Ambusher Tactics
&emsp;**Initiating Combat.** As their name implies, ambushers always wait until they have the element of surprise and an environmental advantage before engaging in combat. They initiate their attack from a distance, preferably with rough terrain and land features they can use as cover between them and the players.


**Avoiding Melee Combat.** Ambushers avoid melee combat whenever possible, preferring to maintain a distance of at least 60 feet from their targets. This distance hinders most targets from engaging them in melee combat yet allows the ambusher to pursue them if they decide to flee. 

**Spreading Out.** Ambushers never form tight formations; they always spread out from each other, thereby forcing enemies to traverse a significant amount of difficult terrain to reach any single target.

**Retreating.** Ambushers are quick to flee if it's clear the fight is not going their way. If their foes manage to repeatedly thwart their bull's-eye damage bonus, or if they fail to execute a surprise attack on the first turn, they will retreat into dense foliage or other natural cover, aiming to ambush the party later when an opportunity arises. Their high survival skill allows them to easily track down their enemies for a subsequent ambush.

#### Wolfheart Ambushers
Wolfheart ambushers follow the same tactics as regular ambushers, with two notable differences:

**Close Quarters Shooter.** Unlike regular ambushers, wolfheart ambushers are not as averse to being in melee range due to their Close Quarters Shooter ability. This means they are more willing to launch ambushes in environments where they can't initiate from as far away.

**Ambusher's Net.** The ambusher's net serves as an escape tool and a way to enable their bull's-eye ability. When a creature engages in melee combat with a wolfheart ambusher, the ambusher responds by throwing its net on the creature as a bonus action, then shoots at point-blank range. If unsuccessful, the wolfheart ambusher will distance itself from the target, continuing to shoot at it each turn.

### Woodland Ambusher Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from woodland ambushers are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Woodland Ambusher Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

# Chariots

Chariots are iconic vehicles of war, allowing mighty steeds to pull soldier-filled carriages into battle. The number of steeds able to pull a chariot and the number of riders its carriage can support varies from one vehicle to the next. Some are even designed to be pulled by creatures other than horses. Chariots may charge headlong into enemy forces or ride past foes who are then dispatched by scythed wheels and spear-wielding riders. They are often a status symbol, and many warrior generals lead their armies from them. In some cultures, chariots are used for racing or other gladiatorial sporting events. 

The following rules can help you codify ways to use chariots in your games. They can be applied to chariots of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own chariots. The rules here can be applied to most vehicles pulled by other creatures, such as wagons and carriages. At the end of the document, there are some example chariots you can incorporate into your own games.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.



#### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, chariots are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The chariot may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by steeds.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.

<br>

> ##### Determining Chariot CR
>When building your own chariot, you can determine its CR using most of the creature creation guidelines described in the DMG with the following modifications:
> * Determine its Offensive CR using additional damage per round it grants to its riders and steeds.
> * Determine its Defensive CR using half its HP.
> * Consider other traits it has the same way you would consider creature attributes.
