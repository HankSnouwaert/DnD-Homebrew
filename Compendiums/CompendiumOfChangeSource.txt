# Demonic Compendium of Change
These demons are born from the mortal desire to lie and distort the world around them.  These demons are the antithesis of truth and stability, continually changing themselves and the world around them in maddening ways.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to warp and manipulate humanoids.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of deceit and manipulation.  

***Mortal Followers.*** In addition to demons, the forces of change include mortals skilled in deception and trickery who desire forbidden knowledge even at the cost of their own sanity. They are blessed with strange mutations and eldritch powers, and many can wield chaotic magic. Those affected this way can range from humanoid sorcerers to monstrous creatures of the mortal realm afflicted by demonic exposure, which are quickly twisted into bizarre abominations.

***The Illusion of Reality.***  For the forces of change, truth and reality are simply concepts to be twisted a manipulated.  The only constant in the multiverse is change, and no fact or certainty can withstand reality's constant metamorphosis.  All of existence is in a neverending state of becoming, and demons of change fully embrace this chaos. The psychological instability they induce extends to the material world, and a demon of change's presence destabilizes reality, causing objects to twist and bend in impossible ways.

***Architects of Fate.***  The pliable nature of reality leads the forces of change to see it as something to be manipulated like a marionette.  They are schemers and manipulators, always looking for ways to bend fate in their favor. Demons of change often tempt mortals with knowledge and hidden insights into the nature of reality, but these ploys are always manipulation serving a larger scheme.  These schemes are multilayered, with each lie part of a larger plot and each plot a piece of a grand conspiracy.  No matter how many layers of deceit are pulled back, there are still more manipulations at play, and attempting to understand how they all play into each other can drive a mortal mind mad.  Whether these schemes serve some grand plan or they are manipulation for manipulation's sake remains a mystery.

***Arcane Masters.***  Demons of change have an intrinsic connection to the nature of magic.  In many ways, magic is the epitome of what they represent. Magic manipulates reality to defy natural law, making the universe's rules ever more incomprehensible.  Even the lowliest demons of change can channel this arcane chaos to some extent, and the greatest among them are some of the mightiest mages in existence.  The magic these fiends wield is chaos in its purest form, and nothing it touches is safe from its reality-warping effects.  Mortals who attempt to study it risk subjecting their bodies to arcane mutations and their minds to a whirlwind of insanity.

# Running Demonic Rage Adventures 

Demons of rage represent the burning hatred for the world mortals carry in their hearts and the dark urge to violently tear it all apart. They are drawn to people and places rife with violence and are fueled by the inability of mortals to make peace with the world as it is, thus allowing frustration and bitterness to boil over into conflict. Mortals who seek to enhance their power so that they may better unleash their rage upon the world may make pacts with these demons, forfeiting their souls for greater strength and martial powers.

Players are most likely to encounter these demons when theyâ€™ve been summoned by such mortals. But demons of rage may also spawn in locations where violence and rage run rampant. A bloody battlefield, a countryside plagued by violent raiding, or a city gripped by riots are all places where demons of rage may manifest themselves and begin their brutal rampage.

Mortal followers of rage or creatures warped by its demonic influence have fewer hindrances navigating the Material Plane and can appear in almost any location. However, the longer they linger in an area and spread the destructive influence of rage, the more likely that actual demons of rage will begin to spawn.

### Forces of Rage Motivations

Demons of rage and creatures warped by their influence have brutal appearances that reflect the uncontrollable hatred they carry. They are straightforward creatures with little guile and seek only to inflict their hatred upon the world as violently as possible. They don't scheme, manipulate, seduce, or whittle away the subject of their hatred; indirect means of action are a frustrating sign of weakness, and weakness and vulnerability are anathema to their existence. 

While creatures of rage are not necessarily stupid, their motivations are usually simple. They are angry. There is something or someone that anger is being directed at. They seek to bring that anger to bear against said something or someone using violent means. All other goals and motivations revolve around achieving greater means of enacting violence.

When role-playing creatures of rage, anger is the obvious emotion to lean into. The degree to which the anger is expressed can vary from mindless fury to a controlled but intense simmer. Many creatures of rage are prone to reckless action, which can quickly make their behavior predictable. The most dangerous among them are tactful in how and when they unleash their fury, and you can make a creature of rage surprisingly frightening by being subtle about the hatred boiling just beneath the surface, waiting to erupt when players least suspect it.


#### Common Creature of Rage Motivations
* Unleash violence on a hated enemy
* Incite violence among mortals
* Battle with worthy adversaries to enhance skills
* Aquire powerful armaments of war

### Creature of Rage Tactics
These creatures share many similar characteristics that lead to certain fighting styles. 

***High Damage.*** The forces of rage are usually more focused on offense over defense and capable of inflicting large amounts of damage very quickly. Some focus more on single-target damage, and others on groups, but they will all seek to attack foes as quickly as possible.

***Melee Oritanted.*** The forces of rage usually have better melee options than ranged options. There are exceptions to this, but it is usually in their best interest to close the distance foes as quickly as possible and prevent them from fleeing combat.

***Anti-Magic.*** The forces of rage generally don't utilize magical spells. They rely on strong anti-magic defense to negate enemy spellcasters and level the playing field. 

***Low Defense.*** Outside of abilities that negate magical interference, the forces of rage usually have lackluster defensive stats and abilities. They rely on ending the fight quickly through high damage.

#### Engagement

Demons of rage rely on speed rather than stealth to rapidly engage players in combat. Their fragility and lack of ranged firepower means they are at the greatest disadvantage before closing the distance with players, so they must prioritize moving in as quickly as possible. If possible, they should rush fragile, ranged damage dealers first.

#### Combat

Despite being relatively fragile, the forces of rage show little concern for their well-being. However, they will prioritize attacking the "glass cannon" players who are the greatest threat to them and the easiest to kill. Thus, their greatest defense is to go completely on the offensive. Even relatively unintelligent creatures of rage will instinctively gang up on targets to bring them down as quickly as possible, and the intelligent ones will find more sophisticated ways to quickly eliminate soft targets that are a more significant threat.

#### Retreat
The forces of rage will rarely retreat, even when on their home plane where death would be permanent. Their fury makes retreat almost impossible, even when commanded to pull back by those leading them. As such, commanders leading forces of rage will never count on being able to execute a tactical withdrawal or even pulling their forces back once they're engaged.

# Running Demonic Change Adventures
Demons of change represent the mind's desire to understand and manipulate the world to achieve a mocking superiority over it and undermine the rules and imagined truths others cling to. They are drawn to people and places filled with deceit and selfish machinations and draw power from the mortal tendency to twist reality through falsehood and obfuscation, thus allowing trickery, discord, and dysfunction to run rampant. Cynical mortals seeking to get one over on the world and its seemingly arbitrary restrictions or those wishing to delve into forbidden knowledge may make pacts with these demons, forfeiting their souls and sanity for eldritch enhancements and arcane power.

Players are most likely to encounter these demons when they've been summoned by such mortals. But demons of change may also spawn in locations where deceit or chaotic magics run amok. Libraries housing forbidden knowledge, landscapes ravaged by the reckless use of magic, and royal courts quietly being torn apart by machiavellian scheming are all places where demons of change may slip into reality and begin sowing chaos.

Mortal followers of change or creatures warped by its demonic influence have fewer hindrances navigating the Material Plane and can appear in almost any location. However, the longer they linger in an area and spread the twisting influence of change, the more likely that actual demons of change will begin to spawn.

### Forces of Change Motivations
Demons of change and creatures warped by their influence often have twisted and mutated appearances that reflect the madness they carry. They are rarely straightforward creatures, often using seemingly unnecessary levels of guile and trickery to achieve their inscrutable goals. Rather than making head-on attacks, they usually utilize magic to undo their foes, and even those who rely on martial powers use trickery to strike at foes where they least suspect it.

The motivations of a demon or follower of change are maddeningly difficult to decipher. Every time it seems the goal of one plot is uncovered, it just leads down into another layer of schemes. Many theorize that there is no "end goal" for any follower of change as this would mean committing to some final state of reality, which is antithetical to everything that drives these creatures. Instead, they scheme and manipulate simply for the sake of instilling neverending unpredictable change into the world, their final goal being that no goals can ever be achieved.

When role-playing creatures of change, it's good to find a balance between giving them identifiable personality traits while still keeping them unpredictable. Low-level demons and creatures that are less intelligent or have been driven to madness may behave like erratic chaos agents, never thinking more than one step ahead. More intelligent followers of change will usually have hidden multilayered goals, and all their interactions with others are an exercise in manipulation. 

As a DM, you may not need to know all their hidden schemes, but keep in mind that the schemes exist, and all the creatures of change's interactions are done to try to trick others into playing into those schemes. Creatures of change are incapable of providing the truth unless it's being used as part of some greater manipulation, so it's safest to always play them, assuming they have ulterior motives.

#### Common Creature of Change Motivations
* Obtain lost eldritch knowledge or powerful magical artifacts
* Play a cruel prank on an individual or group
* Prevent or undo the formation of an orderly organization that provides material or spiritual stability to the land
* The pursuit of some completely nonsensical goal that's part of an even larger web of convoluted schemes

### Creature of Change Tactics
Despite their erratic and ever-changing nature, these creatures share many similar characteristics that lead to certain fighting styles. 

***Magically Inclined.*** Creatures of change are often spell casters or at least make spell attacks and utilize spell-like abilities. This means they'll usually start fights by cycling through their most potent spells/abilities to inflict area-of-effect damage and debilitating effects on players.

***Ranged Combatants.*** The focus on magic means creatures of change naturally excel at fighting from a distance. They usually try to stay out of melee and soften up their foes as much as possible.

***Poor Martial Fighters.***  Most creatures of change don't do well in direct martial combat. They are generally fragile and their weapon attacks weak. If they move in to fight directly, it should be against debilitated or outnumbered foes.

#### Engagement

Creatures of change usually wait to engage players until they feel they have an advantage, at which point they quickly begin unleashing their magical powers to maintain the advantage. They try to catch players off balance and keep them that way.

#### Combat
Demons of change will run circles around their enemies, kiting them as they continue to bombard them with spells. They will use magic and trickery to keep the players from being able to engage them for as long as possible while debilitating the most dangerous targets.

#### Retreat
Demons of change are quick to retreat if they no longer feel they are getting one over on the players. Even if they seem to be winning, they may retreat because the fight no longer serves their current scheme or simply because it's no longer entertaining. Conversely, they may fight to the end if losing actually helps further their hidden agendas.
