# Demonic <br> Compendium <br> of Change
These demons are born from the mortal desire to lie and distort the world around them.  These demons are the antithesis of truth and stability, continually changing themselves and the world around them in maddening ways.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to warp and manipulate humanoids.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of deceit and manipulation.  

***Mortal Followers.*** In addition to demons, the forces of change include mortals skilled in deception and trickery who desire forbidden knowledge even at the cost of their own sanity. They are blessed with strange mutations and eldritch powers, and many can wield chaotic magic. Those affected this way can range from humanoid sorcerers to monstrous creatures of the mortal realm afflicted by demonic exposure, which are quickly twisted into bizarre abominations.

***The Illusion of Reality.***  For the forces of change, truth and reality are simply concepts to be twisted a manipulated.  The only constant in the multiverse is change, and no fact or certainty can withstand reality's constant metamorphosis.  All of existence is in a neverending state of becoming, and demons of change fully embrace this chaos. The psychological instability they induce extends to the material world, and a demon of change's presence destabilizes reality, causing objects to twist and bend in impossible ways.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

***Architects of Fate.***  The pliable nature of reality <Br> leads the forces of change to see it as something to be manipulated like a marionette.  They are schemers and manipulators, always looking for ways to bend fate in their favor. Demons of change often tempt mortals with knowledge and hidden insights into the nature of reality, but these ploys are always manipulation serving a larger scheme.  These schemes are multilayered, with each lie part of a larger plot and each plot a piece of a grand conspiracy.  No matter how many layers of deceit are pulled back, there are still more manipulations at play, and attempting to understand how they all play into each other can drive a mortal mind mad.  Whether these schemes serve some grand plan or they are manipulation for manipulation's sake remains a mystery.

***Arcane Masters.***  Demons of change have an intrinsic connection to the nature of magic.  In many ways, magic is the epitome of what they represent. Magic manipulates reality to defy natural law, making the universe's rules ever more incomprehensible.  Even the lowliest demons of change can channel this arcane chaos to some extent, and the greatest among them are some of the mightiest mages in existence.  The magic these fiends wield is chaos in its purest form, and nothing it touches is safe from its reality-warping effects.  Mortals who attempt to study it risk subjecting their bodies to arcane mutations and their minds to a whirlwind of insanity.

# Running Demonic Change Adventures
Demons of change represent the mind's desire to understand and manipulate the world to achieve a mocking superiority over it and undermine the rules and imagined truths others cling to. They are drawn to people and places filled with deceit and selfish machinations and draw power from the mortal tendency to twist reality through falsehood and obfuscation, thus allowing trickery, discord, and dysfunction to run rampant. Cynical mortals seeking to get one over on the world and its seemingly arbitrary restrictions or those wishing to delve into forbidden knowledge may make pacts with these demons, forfeiting their souls and sanity for eldritch enhancements and arcane power.

Players are most likely to encounter these demons when they've been summoned by such mortals. But demons of change may also spawn in locations where deceit or chaotic magics run amok. Libraries housing forbidden knowledge, landscapes ravaged by the reckless use of magic, and royal courts quietly being torn apart by machiavellian scheming are all places where demons of change may slip into reality and begin sowing chaos.

Mortal followers of change or creatures warped by its demonic influence have fewer hindrances navigating the Material Plane and can appear in almost any location. However, the longer they linger in an area and spread the twisting influence of change, the more likely that actual demons of change will begin to spawn.

### Forces of Change Motivations
Demons of change and creatures warped by their influence often have twisted and mutated appearances that reflect the madness they carry. They are rarely straightforward creatures, often using seemingly unnecessary levels of guile and trickery to achieve their inscrutable goals. Rather than making head-on attacks, they usually utilize magic to undo their foes, and even those who rely on martial powers use trickery to strike at foes where they least suspect it.

The motivations of a demon or follower of change are maddeningly difficult to decipher. Every time it seems the goal of one plot is uncovered, it just leads down into another layer of schemes. Many theorize that there is no "end goal" for any follower of change as this would mean committing to some final state of reality, which is antithetical to everything that drives these creatures. Instead, they scheme and manipulate simply for the sake of instilling neverending unpredictable change into the world, their final goal being that no goals can ever be achieved.

When role-playing creatures of change, it's good to find a balance between giving them identifiable personality traits while still keeping them unpredictable. Low-level demons and creatures that are less intelligent or have been driven to madness may behave like erratic chaos agents, never thinking more than one step ahead. More intelligent followers of change will usually have hidden multilayered goals, and all their interactions with others are an exercise in manipulation. 

As a DM, you may not need to know all their hidden schemes, but keep in mind that the schemes exist, and all the creatures of change's interactions are done to try to trick others into playing into those schemes. Creatures of change are incapable of providing the truth unless it's being used as part of some greater manipulation, so it's safest to always play them, assuming they have ulterior motives.

#### Common Creature of Change Motivations
* Obtain lost eldritch knowledge or powerful magical artifacts
* Play a cruel prank on an individual or group
* Prevent or undo the formation of an orderly organization that provides material or spiritual stability to the land
* The pursuit of some completely nonsensical goal that's part of an even larger web of convoluted schemes

### Creature of Change Tactics
Despite their erratic and ever-changing nature, these creatures share many similar characteristics that lead to certain fighting styles. 

***Magically Inclined.*** Creatures of change are often spell casters or at least make spell attacks and utilize spell-like abilities. This means they'll usually start fights by cycling through their most potent spells/abilities to inflict area-of-effect damage and debilitating effects on players.

***Ranged Combatants.*** The focus on magic means creatures of change naturally excel at fighting from a distance. They usually try to stay out of melee and soften up their foes as much as possible.

***Poor Martial Fighters.***  Most creatures of change don't do well in direct martial combat. They are generally fragile and their weapon attacks weak. If they move in to fight directly, it should be against debilitated or outnumbered foes.

#### Engagement

Creatures of change usually wait to engage players until they feel they have an advantage, at which point they quickly begin unleashing their magical powers to maintain the advantage. They try to catch players off balance and keep them that way.

#### Combat
Demons of change will run circles around their enemies, kiting them as they continue to bombard them with spells. They will use magic and trickery to keep the players from being able to engage them for as long as possible while debilitating the most dangerous targets.

#### Retreat
Demons of change are quick to retreat if they no longer feel they are getting one over on the players. Even if they seem to be winning, they may retreat because the fight no longer serves their current scheme or simply because it's no longer entertaining. Conversely, they may fight to the end if losing actually helps further their hidden agendas.

# Player Options

## Primal Path

### Path of the Demon Soul
Barbarians who follow this accursed path discover a demonic presence within themselves, yearning for release. This presence may be the result of a demonic curse, overexposure to Abyssal magics, or even demonic possession. In any case, when these barbarians lose control, their fiendish nature manifests itself visibly, warping their appearance and allowing them to unleash an unholy fury upon their foes.


#### Demonic Surges
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
The dark powers coursing through you give you access to demonic abilities in the form of Demonic Surges. Demonic Surges are supernatural abilities that momentarily boost your combat abilities or create fiendish spell-like effects. You use your Strength modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Demonic Surge and when making an attack roll with one. If you are raging, you may add your rage damage to any one damage roll made as a result of a Demonic Surge. Using a Demonic Surge also counts as making an attack that round for the purposes of maintaining your rage.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

<div align="center"> 

**Surge save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

**Surge attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

</div>

**Surge Slots.** The Demonic Surges table shows how many surge slots you have to use Demonic Surges of 1st level and higher. To use one of these surges, you must expend a slot of the surge's level or higher. You regain all expended Surge Slots when you complete a long rest.

**Surges Known of 1st-Level and Higher.** You know three 1st-level Demonic Surges of your choice from the list Demonic Surges section, which starts on the next page.

The Surges Known column of the Demon Soul Surges table shows when you learn more Demonic Surges of 1st level or higher.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the surges you know with another surge of your choice. This surge must be of a level for which you have surge slots.

#### Fiendish Resilience 
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
Your demonic nature grants you increased resistance to elemental forces. You now have resistance to lightning, fire, and cold damage while raging.

#### Reckless Surge
*6th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>

You may apply your Reckless Attack feature to any attacks you make as part of your Demonic Surges. Additionally, when you use a Demonic Surge that requires creatures to make a saving throw, you may choose to force all affected creatures to make their saving throw with disadvantage. If you do, all attack rolls against you have advantage and all saving throws you make have disadvantage until the start of your next turn.


#### Brutal Surge
*10th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
You may apply your Brutal Critical feature to any attacks you make with your Demonic Surges. Additionally, when you use your Reckless Surge or Reckless Attack feature, you can choose to have your Demonic Surges ignore all resistances and treat all immunity as though it is resistance until the start of your next turn. Doing so causes you to lose all resistances granted by your rage until the start of your next turn.


#### Chaos Conduit
*14th level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
While raging, you may use a 1st level demonic surge without expending a Surge Slot. You can use this ability only once per rage.

#### Demonic Surges
The surges are grouped by surge level and listed alphabetically. 

##### 1st Level Surges
&emsp;**Abyssal Skulk.**  As an action, you magically turn invisible. The invisibility lasts for 1 minute or until you attack, make a damage roll, or force a creature to make a saving throw.

**Arrogant Rage.** When you enter a rage or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage such that you gain a surge of reckless confidence, allowing you to demoralize any who would dare strike you.

While raging this way, whenever a creature makes an attack against you and would have advantage as a result of your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge features, you can use your reaction to demoralize that creature, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it loses the advantage your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge granted it and instead suffers disadvantage on the attack.
 
Creatures immune to being charmed and frightened automatically pass this save.

This surge ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.



**Burning Whip.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to summon a burning whip in a free hand that you can use to immediately make a single melee spell attack against a creature within 30 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 3d6 fire damage, and the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 25 feet toward you. 

The whip disappears immediately after you make this attack.

**Defile Earth.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to cause the ground within 10 feet of you to become polluted with demonic ichor. The area is corrupted for the next minute, during which time it is difficult terrain for creatures other than you. 

As an action, you can cause any number of 5-foot-by-5-foot square areas covered in this ichor to burst with demonic rot, which clears that area of the ichor. Any creature standing in the burst must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

**Demonic Appendages.** As a bonus action, choose a damage type from piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage. You cause your hands to mutate into demonic appendages (such as claws, tentacles, or skewers) for the next hour or until you dismiss this surge as a bonus action. The appendages can be used as weapons while not holding anything and count as simple melee weapons with the Light property that add your Strength modifier to attack and damage rolls when you attack with them. They each deal 1d10 of the chosen damage type on it.

**Fiendish Horns.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to grow large demonic horns and use them to make a single melee spell attack against a target within 5 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 3d8 piercing damage, and if the target is a creature and you moved at least 20 ft. before making the attack, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature is knocked prone, and you may push it up to 10 feet away from you.

The horns disappear immediately after making this attack.


**Flames of Chaos.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to hurl a bolt of iridescent fire at a creature within 100 feet of you as a ranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 fire damage and becomes engulfed in chaotic flames until the end of your next turn. 

If the creature takes damage from one of your Demonic Surges while covered in these flames,  the flames disappear, and that surge deals an additional 1d12 damage as it draws energy from the fires.

**Foul Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 2d6 poison damage. The target must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of your next turn.

**Fresh Meat.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to feast on the corpse of one Small or larger creature within 5 feet of you that died within the last minute, causing you to regain a number of hit points equal to 2d6 + your Strength modifier.

**Hateful Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by focusing it into a hatred for another creature you can see within 90 feet of you. For the duration of this effect, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to that creature whenever you hit it with an attack. 

This surge ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

\columnbreak

**Hungering Jaws.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to attempt to bite a creature within 5 feet of you with razor-sharp jaws as a melee spell attack. On a hit, you deal 2d8 piercing damage, and if the target is a creature, you regain a number of hit points equal to the damage it dealt.

**Hypnotic Summons.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to whisper maddening words to one creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that can hear you, twisting its mind and drawing it toward you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as close as its speed allows toward you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and doesn’t have to move toward you. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

**Lightning Blade.** As part of an Attack action, you can choose to forgo one of your attacks to create a blade of chaotic lighting in a free hand that you can use to immediately make a single melee spell attack. This attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 18 or higher. On a hit, it deals 2d12 lightning damage. The blade disappears immediately after making this attack.

**Nightmare Rage.** When you enter a rage or as a bonus action while raging, you can enhance your rage by filling your mind with nightmarish visions that you can inflict upon others. While raging this way, whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack or an attack from one of your Demonic Surges, you may surround the target with nightmarish visions for the next minute or until you surround another creature with visions. 

If the target willingly moves 5 feet before the visions end, it must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking 2d6 psychic damage on a failure, or half as much on a success, and the visions affecting it end.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge beyond what this ability allows you to maintain.

**Savage Rush.**  As a bonus action, you draw upon an unholy vigor, allowing you to move up to your movement speed horizontally in a straight line. The first creature you run into during this movement must succeed on a Strength saving or be pushed ahead of you for the rest of the movement. If the creature succeeds on the save, or you run into a second creature, your movement stops.

##### 2nd Level Surges

**Burning Smite.**  When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 3d10 fire damage.

**Cruel Revival.** As a bonus action, you speak a dark incantation which awakens the corpse of a Small or Medium creature you can see within 30 feet of you that died within the last 10 minutes. The corpse immediately stands up and becomes a **zombie** (the statistics for zombies can be found in the Monster Manual), and it gains a bonus to its attack and damage rolls equal to your Strength ability modifier. In combat, the zombie shares your initiative count.

While the zombie is within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to mentally command it to do your bidding. If it receives no such commands, it takes no actions and does not move. 

The zombie crumbles to dust after 10 minutes.

**Demonic Eyes.** As an action, you cause your eyes to take on demonic traits and appearance. For the next 8 hours, you gain darkvision out to 120 and areas of dim light are not considered lightly obscured to you.

**Horror Nimbus.** As an action, you magically emit scintillating, multicolored light. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of that you that can see the light must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit.


**Indestructible Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a <br> bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage to <br> make yourself nearly indestructible. While this effect <br> lasts, you have an advantage on Constitution checks <br> and saving throws and resistance to all damage <br> except radiant damage.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute <br> passes, or you enhance your rage with another <br> Demonic Surge.

**Inflicted Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a <br> bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage <br> by attempting to psychically inflict another creature <br> within 120 feet of you with it. That creature must <br> succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be <br> subjected to this rage for one minute, until your <br> rage ends, or until you enhance your rage with <br> another surge.

\columnbreak

While under the effects of this rage, the creature can only use its action to make weapon attacks or take the Dash action, and it can no longer cast or maintain concentration on spells.

The creature can make an Intelligence saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

**Inhuman Grace.**  As a bonus action, you endow yourself with such unnatural grace that any you stride past have their minds rent by the sight of your movements. Until the end of your turn, whenever you move 5 feet away from a creature that can see you, it takes 2d8 psychic damage. A creature can only take this damage once per turn. 

If you used your Reckless Attack or Reckless Surge features this turn, your speed also increases by 20 feet until the end of the turn.


**Insanity Gaze.**  As an action, you turn your madding gaze upon a creature you can see within 90 feet of you, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it must use its movement on its next turn to move within 5 feet of a creature of your choice and then use its action to make a melee attack against that creature. If it is unable to reach the chosen creature, it does not use its action that turn.

**Malevolent Flame.** As an action, you create an area of flame that fills a 5-foot cube in front of you and move it out 30 ft. away from you, where it remains until the end of your next turn, at which point the flame moves toward your current location. The flame disappears after reaching you or moving 30 ft. toward you.

Whenever the flame moves into the space of a creature other than you, or a creature other than you ends its turn standing in the flame, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d6 fire damage, and on a pass, it takes half as much.

The flame ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

**Torturous Claws.** As an action, two razor-sharp clawed limbs grow from you and strike at nearby foes. Make two melee spells attacks against targets within 5 feet of you. On a hit, a target takes 2d10 slashing damage and can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn as it is racked with pain.

If both attacks made this way hit the same target, it is afflicted with even more intense pain, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. It takes an additional 3d10 psychic damage on a failed save or half as much on a success. 

The limbs disappear immediately after you make the attacks with them.

**Unholy Stench.** As an action, you cause a foul smell to emanate out to a 10-foot radius around yourself. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d6 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of your next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.


**Spew Bile.** As an action, you spew forth a stream of corrosive bile. Each creature in a 15-foot cone in front of you takes 4d4 acid damage and must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is covered in acid, causing it to take another 4d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn unless a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off of it beforehand. On a successful save, a creature is not covered in acid and takes no additional damage at the end of its next turn.



**Rampaging Rage.**  When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage with an insatiable bloodlust. While under this effect, up to once on each of your turns, when you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack or a Demonic Surge, you gain an additional action. This action can only be used to take a Dash action or an Attack action to make one weapon attack.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

##### 3rd Level Surges

**Cackling Flail.** As an action, you choose a point you can see within 15 feet of you and conjure a three-headed demonic flail made of cackling skulls in a free hand which you use to make three melee spell attacks against up to three different creatures who are within 15 feet of the chosen point. On a hit, an attack from this flail deals 3d8 thunder damage. 

If one or more of the creatures hit by the flail is reduced to 0 hit points, you may immediately make another attack with it against each of the remaining targets who still have 1 or more hit points. If this second set of attacks reduces another creature to 0 hit points, you may repeat the process.

Once you can no longer make any attacks, the flail disappears.

**Contaminating Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage to channel it into a stream of demonic corruption that oozes into a 15-foot radius area centered on yourself. This area moves with you, and you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. 

When a creature you haven’t designated enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage, and its speed is halved while it remains in the area. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and its speed isn’t reduced.

The contaminated area disappears if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Dark Flight.** As an action, you cause wings to spring from your back granting you flying speed of 60 feet for the next 10 minutes. If the effect ends while you are in the air, you immediately begin falling unless some other effect prevents this.

\pagebreakNum

**Devour.** As an action, your jaw unhinges, and you attempt to magically swallow a Medium or smaller creature within 5 feet of you that you can see. That creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by you. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside you, and it takes 3d4 acid damage at the start of each of your turns. 

The creature is swallowed until you lose your concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell, except it can be maintained while raging). If you lose concentration, the swallowed creature is regurgitated and falls prone into a space of your choice within 5 feet of you.

**Ecstatic Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 4d8 psychic damage to it as you subject it to overwhelming bliss. Additionally, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of your next turn.

**Eldritch Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by allowing maddening demonic knowledge to flood your mind. For the duration of this effect, you have advantage on all Intelligence checks and saving throws. Additionally, once per turn, you may use a 1st level Demonic Surge that replaces one of your attacks without expending a surge slot. 

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Fire Stomp.** As an action, you slam the ground, causing fire to erupt out from you to a 15-foot radius. Each creature other than you in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d6 fire damage. On a pass, it takes half as much damage.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Lightning Lance.** As an action, you launch a bolt of lightning in a 60-foot long 10-foot wide line. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 6d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Manic Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you channel your rage to the point of manic insanity, turning yourself into a whirlwind of death. While in this state, if you make an attack that would have advantage as a result of your Reckless Attack feature, you can forgo that advantage to make the same attack against another creature within 5 feet of the original target and within the attack’s range. These extra attacks can’t benefit from advantage from any source or be replaced with Demonic Surges. 

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Undying Evil.**  You gain the demonic ability to escape death. As an action, you place a ward on yourself that lasts for 8 hours or until you use this surge again. If you die while under the effects of the ward, your body dissolves into foul ichor, leaving behind only the equipment you were wearing or carrying. 

After 1 minute, you reform in the unoccupied space closest to the location where you died. Your soul must be both willing and able to reform, and you can’t return to life if you died of old age. 

When you reform, you return to life with 1 hit point and the ward ends.


**Warp Flesh.** As an action, you target a creature you can see within 5 feet of you and warp its body with chaotic magics. It must make a Charisma saving throw or become brittle until the end of your next turn. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

**Warp Jump.** As an action, you teleport, along with any equipment you are wearing or carrying, up to 100 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Before or after teleporting, you can make one attack as part of this action.


##### 4th Level Surges

**Bellow of Endless Fury.** As an action, you unleash a roar of fiery rage in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not knocked prone.

The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

**Chaotic Smite.** When you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you may use a bonus action to deal an additional 4d10 force damage as you channel raw chaos through it. 

Additionally, the target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or suffer one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below until the end of your next turn.


##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight. At the end of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|

**Limb Storm** As an action, you briefly grow extra sets of demonic limbs which strike out at nearby creatures. You may make up to six melee spell attacks with these limbs as part of this action, which each deal 1d12 piercing, slashing, or bludgeoning damage (your choice) on hit. 

The limbs disappear immediately after you make the attacks with them.

**Oozing Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage, causing you to grow wobbling mounds of slime and flesh, which seal your wounds as you receive them. For the duration of this effect, you gain a +10 to the Constitution saving throw you make as part of your Relentless Rage feature, and you regain 1d6 hit points at the start of each of your turns.

This effect ends if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Shared Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you can enhance your rage to inspire it in another willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you. That creature gains the following benefits until your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge:

* It has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
* It has resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

* When it makes its first attack on each of its turns, it can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives it advantage on melee weapon attacks, but attack rolls against it have advantage until its next turn.
* If the creature is able to cast spells, it can't cast them or concentrate on them.



**Sentient Rage.** When you enter a rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you enhance your rage by focusing it into an entirely separate consciousness, which may even form itself into a new head that grows from your body. When you do so, you may choose two Demonic Surges you know that both enhance your rage and have a combined level of 4 or less. You gain the effects of both those surges until your rage ends, one minute passes, or you enhance your rage with another Demonic Surge.

**Soul Rend.** Your chest cracks open and projects a vortex of life-draining energy out to 30 feet from you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 5d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Each creature that is Small or larger and dropped to 0 hit points by this effect dies, causing you to regain hit points equal to the number of hit dice it had.

**Stunning Screech.** As an action, you emit a horrific screech. Each creature within 20 feet of you that can hear it must succeed on a DC Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. 

**Summon Demon.** You utter foul abyssal words, calling a demon forth from the chaos of the Abyss. Choose a demon of CR 5 or lower such as a **shadow demon** or a **barlgura**. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 hour has passed.

The demon obeys your commands, and in combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one that is listed in its stat block or any other action that the demon would be capable of.

### Demons Soul Barbarian Archetypes
If you have a specific type of demon or demon lord you want your barbarian to emulate the powers of, you can choose Demonic Surges that thematically fit with that demon. The following Demonic Surge lists are grouped based on common demonic themes and demon lords, though you may need to change how you describe of some of the surges to better fit the powers associated with your theme. 

Note that some surges like *demonic appendages*, *demonic eyes*, *undying evil*, and *summon demon* are so general that they can thematically fit with almost any type of demon.

### Demon Soul Adventurers
Below are some options that can be used as inspiration for your barbarian’s backstory and the origin of their powers. 

| d12  | Demon Soul Origin |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | You underwent a dark ritual in exchange for the power needed to achieve your goals |
|  2  | You hail from a demon worshiping barbarian tribe.  You've abandoned the tribe and their evil ways, but you still wield the dark forces they bestowed upon you. |
|  3  | A gateway to the Abyss opened near your home town.  You survived the ordeal, but were forever changed by its demonic energies.
|  4  | You were the subject of dark and bizarre arcane experiments.  |
|  5  | All you remember were fiends attacking your town.  Now, when you're in danger, you black out.  When you come to, you're surrounded by bodies and left with only brief flashes of what happened. |
|  6  | You took it upon yourself to trap the soul of a demon within yourself, thereby preventing it from returning to the Abyss and reforming.  |
|  7  | You were subjected to a fiendish curse which you struggle to keep from consuming your soul. |
|  8  | You have fiendish parentage, which you learned about when you came of age and your fiendish traits began manifesting. |
|  9  | You've attracted the attention of a demon lord who is bestowing its "gifts" upon you in hopes of corrupting your soul.
| 10  | You were once a demon, but sought to escape the Abyss and find redemption by reincarnating yourself as a mortal.  
| 11  | You are dedicated to fighting demons by using their own powers against them, and you've turned yourself into an unrelenting slayer who brings doom to any fiend you find. 
| 12  | Your powers aren't fiendish in nature, but have some other planar origin, such as Limbo, the Far Realm, or the Elemental Plane of Fire.

## Demon Soul Barbarian NPCs
The following stat blocks can be used to describe non-player characters who are demon soul barbarians or warriors with similar powers. You can choose the stat block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC and apply the Demonic Surges of your choice that best fit the desired theme of the NPC, as described in its Demonic Surges feature. You may also opt to provide your NPCs with fewer known surges than the stat block suggests so as to keep its combat options simpler and make it easier for players to learn its attack patterns.

To further customize your NPC, apply the racial traits of whichever humanoid race you’ve chosen for it.

> ##### Demon Barbarian Building Tips
> &#8226; Don’t add more different types of surges than you need to reach the design goal of your barbarian
> <br> &#8226; Only having one surge that enhances the barbarian’s rage makes it a lot easier to manage.
> <br> &#8226; Changing out weapons & skills or modifying mental stats are a simple ways to help differentiate the look and style of your barbarians.
<br> &#8226; If you give a barbarian the *eldritch rage* surge, it needs to know a surge that can be used in place of an attack, and it's best to allow it to use that surge as a bonus action while raging. Otherwise, it will rarely get the same resource-saving benefits as a player from the ability.

## Demon Soul Barbarian Examples
The following is a list of example stat blocks made using the demon soul barbarian templates. The barbarian examples don’t always know as many surges as their template stat block suggests.  Rather than using surge slots, the different demonic surge abilities each have a certain number of uses. Other modifications include tweaking non-combat stats, swapping out weapons, or replacing the rage feature with the one enhanced by a known demonic surge. All these changes are made to enhance the theme of the barbarian and streamline its stat block for readability.

## Spells of Change
Spellcasters wielding magic of change favor spells of transformation, trickery, and chaos. While many existing D&D spells can represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this unpredictable style of sorcery into your campaigns.

#### Act of Treason
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Choose one creature with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While charmed in this way, the creature is overcome by the fires of treachery.

On each of the charmed target’s turns, it must move up to its speed toward a creature you mentally choose, by the safest available route, and use its action to make a melee attack against that creature if it can. If you choose no creature, the target can act normally on its turn.

The target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell on itself on a success.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation (condition described at end of spells section).


#### Burning Hands
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 20-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 you may increases the cone's size by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Chaos Bolt
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You hurl an undulating, warbling mass of chaotic energy at one creature in range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 + 1d12 damage. Choose one of the d8s. The number rolled on that die determines the attack's damage type, as shown below.

| d8  |  Damage Type  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  1  | Acid |
|  2  | Cold|
|  3  | Fire|
|  4  | Force|
|  5  | Lightning|
|  6  | Poison | 
|  7  | Psychic |
|  8  | Thunder |

If you roll the same number on both d8s, the chaotic energy leaps from the target to a different creature of your choice within 60 feet of it. Make a new attack roll against the new target, and make a new damage roll, which could cause the chaotic energy to leap again.

A creature can be targeted only once by each casting of this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, each target takes 1d12 extra damage of the type rolled for each slot level above 1st.

\columnbreak

#### Chaos Storm
*9th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of demon ichor)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
You open a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction.  A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered on a point within range that lasts for the spell's duration.  This sphere is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away.  No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration outside of your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.

#### Gift of Chaos
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A bit of clay)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You unleash the power of chaos to warp a creature’s body. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or suffer a mutation (condition described at end of spells section).

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the target suffers an additional mutation for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

\columnbreak

#### Scorching Stream
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

A line of roaring flame 50 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and you may increases line's length by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.


### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|

## Magic Items of Change
Powerful demons or cults of mutation and forbidden knowledge will sometimes craft magical items which channel their otherworldly and unpredictable powers.  They may wield these items themselves or gift them to worthy followers, though they often shatter the minds of mere mortals.  The following magic items can be used to represent these gifts of change in your campaign.

#### Blade of Fate
*Weapon (any sword), rare, 2,000gp*<br>

Visions of future victories dance across this blade's reflective surface.  None know if it predicts fate or twists it.

At dawn each day, roll two d20s.  If you roll a 20 on either die, reroll it until you roll a different number.  Record the final results of each die.

When you make an attack roll with this weapon and roll one of the numbers you noted, you may treat the roll as if it were a 20.  You can only use each of the noted numbers once this way.  At dawn each day, you lose the numbers from the previous day.



#### Chromatic Tome
*Wonderous item, very rare, 12,000gp (requires attunement)*

This tome serves as a prison for a sorcerous demon and offers great power to those willing to assume terrible risks.

While attuned to this book, you can read from its pages to gather the winds of magic.  This can be done as a bonus action or whenever you roll for initiative.  When you do so, the book gains 2d6 charges which last for 1 minute or until you expend them.  If you roll a 2, you gain no charges and must roll on the Miscast Table below to determine what kind of magical backlash you suffer. 

You can't roll for charges again until you spend 10 minutes studying its pages, which can do during a short or long rest.

While the book has charges, you can expend 3 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17,  attack bonus of +9), using it as your spellcasting focus: *chromatic orb* (3 charges), *scorching ray* (4 charges), *shatter* (4 charges), *lightning bolt* (6 charges) *hunger of hadar* (6 charges), *wall of fire* (7 charges).

 ##### Miscast Table
| 2d6 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  | Miscast Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  2  |    Fiendish limbs tear through reality and pull you into a demonic realm of torment.  Your body is destroyed, and your soul and physical belongings are transported to a layer of the Abyss in possession of a demon lord of the DM's choosing.  |
|  3-4  |  You violently discharge arcane energy, dealing 10d6 force damage to you and each creature within 15 feet of you.|
|  5-6  |   The treacherous demon trapped within the book gives its aid elsewhere.  For the next minute, a creature of the DM's choosing within 100 feet of you gains the ability to cast spells as though it were holding the tome with 12 charges available.|
|  7  |  You take 4d6 necrotic damage and can't cast spells until the start of your next turn.|
|  8-9 |    A massive vortex drains all the magic in the area.  You take 8d6 force damage, and all spells with 100 feet of you are dispelled as though targeted by *dispel magic* cast at 9th level.|
|  10-11  | Your mind is ravaged by demons, causing you to be under the effects of the *feeblemind* spell for the next 10 minutes.|
| 12  | The book becomes overloaded,  gaining 12 charges.  Until it loses these charges, spell attack rolls made as part of casting spells from the book are made with advantage, and all creatures have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make against a spell cast from the book.  The book can't regain charges for the next 1d4 days.|

#### Paradoxical Armor
*Armor (any), very rare, 20,000gp*<br>

This armor flickers in and out of existence, appearing <br> solid at one moment and incorporeal at the next. <br> Attackers have an almost equal chance of hitting <br> the armor's wearer no matter their positioning or tactics.

While wearing this armor, no attack roll can gain advantage or disadvantage against you.


#### Staff of Change 
*Staff, very rare, 15,000gp (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*<br>

This staff infuses spells with the raw powers of chaos, inflicting random mutations on its victims.

While holding this staff, the save DC of all your spells increases by +1.

Additionally, when one or more creatures fail a saving throw against a spell you cast of 3rd level or higher while wielding this staff, you can choose one of those creatures and cause it to suffer a random mutation determined by the Mutation Table below.  At the end of each of the target's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw against the spell's save DC, ending all mutations affecting it on a success.  A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation | Creature Effect |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded and has blindsight with a radius of 5 feet.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight.   At the start of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|

#### Unfathomable Tome
*Wonderous item, very rare, 8,000gp (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This demonic text offers wizards a seemingly endless amount of arcane knowledge, though plumbing its depths risks one's sanity.

This book can be used as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and while you are carrying it, you can speak and write in Abyssal.  The book functions as a spellbook for you, and the gold and time you must spend to copy spells into it is halved.  

\columnbreak



<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Spells from this book cannot be copied into other spellbooks.

Additionally, you may spend an hour studying the book to uncover its secrets. 

When you do so, name three different spells from the wizard spell list that are the same level that you have seen cast or read of in texts such as spellbooks or spell scrolls.  Label these spells 1 through 3.  Roll a d4 and add the spell whose number matches the result to your spellbook.  On a roll of 4, you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spells.  On a failure, you gain a random long-term madness effect for the number of days equal to the level of the chosen spells.  The book can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

When this book becomes unattuned to a creature, all the spells it contains are lost.

####  Wand of Whimsy 
*Wand, very rare, 24,000gp (requires attunement by a spellcaster)* <br> 

This wand was carved from demonic bones and is capable of reducing its victims into writhing beasts of chaotic flesh.

While holding this wand, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls.

When you attack a small or larger creature with a spell attack and roll a 20 on the attack roll while holding this wand, that target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw.  On a failure, the creature dies and its body turns into a **blue terror of change** under your control.  An additional **blue terror of change** is created for each size category above medium the creature was.  

Any **blue terror of change** and any **brimstone terror of change** they spawn share your initiative count.   They take their turns immediately after yours in any order, and they obey your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don't issue any commands, the horrors spend their turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of their abilities.  Any horrors made this way melt into goo after 1 minute.  

A creature killed this way can only be revived by a *true resurrection* or *wish* spell.

# Creatures of Change

## Terrors of Change
These unpredictable demons defy reason and understanding.  Terrors of change have no fixed form, and their bodies constantly writhe and twist into new shapes.  Faces appear and disappear while new limbs stretch out to propel the terror forward or grab at nearby enemies.  While these limbs can be used as potent weapons, the true threat from a terror comes from its innate magical abilities, which allow it to hurl devastating flames anyone and anything that strikes its fancy.

The primary incarnation of a terror of change is known as a pink terror as they are recognizable by their pinkish hue.   These fiends cackle with maniacal glee as they bound to and fro, burning and tearing apart whatever they please.  Their innate magical abilities are amplified when they gather in groups, allowing them to unleash devesting magical displays. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

Nothing gratifies a pink terror more than seeing reality ripped apart in a show of chaotic magical destruction.  

Should a pink terror be slain, it will split into two blue terrors.  Unlike their giddy pink counterparts, blue terrors are sullen and irritable, blaming everything and everyone for their loss of status.  They vent their frustrations on their enemies, spitefully burning and tearing at anything they can.

The death of a blue terror still does not end the cycle of chaos, for they split into two brimstone terrors.  These small fiends are composed entirely of fire and spite.  Aware that they are the lowest ranking demons of change, they seek vengeance on the world, using what power they have to burn everything and everyone around them.

***Sour Terrors.*** Some pink terrors develop a wicked sense of humor and begin taking a perverse joy in finding ways to pull deadly pranks on their victims. They continually seek horribly hilarious ways to bring an end to their enemies and are always seeking new means to do so. Those pink terrors that manage to amuse their masters this way may be granted the "sour gut blessing," a bizarre demonic gift that causes the terror to violently explode in a spray of sour demonic energy when slain.

&emsp;Because demons reform back on their home plain when slain, sour terrors bait enemies into slaying them where they can do the most damage with their sour bursts, much to the amusement of other demonic onlookers. Sour terrors compete with each other to see who can find the most comical situations to explode and will trade stories on their exploits when they reform back on their home plain. 

Once any surviving foes slay a sour terror and relieze their folly, it is to late, for the sour terror leaves behind two bursting blue terrors who will immediately seek out a similar end. Unlike their pink counterparts, these dour sours don't concern themselves with any form of elaborate prank and waste no time charging at their foes and detonating so they can get it over with.

***Chromatic Terrors.*** Demons of change can ascend to new and more powerful forms by absorbing vast amounts of arcane energy. Pink terrors that succeed in this may become the exalted variants of their kind, while brimstone terrors are so unstable they always violently combust in the attempt. Blue terrors occupy a middle-ground and can sometimes absorb vast magical energies without losing total cohesion. These terrors become arcane beings radiating scintillating light, barely holding their physical forms together.

These chromatic horrors continually seek out arcane energies to gorge on so they can maintain their precarious existence. When they find an overabundance of such energies, they may even spawn smaller prismatic terrors from theselves. Those attempting to fight chromatic horrors with spellcraft do so at their own peril, as the magical energies will almost certainly provide them the excess succor needed to spawn more vile demons.

***Exalted Pink Terrors.*** Most pink <br> terrors have short, chaotic lifespans. <br> Between the hazardous nature of their <br> home plane, their antics on the Material Plane, and <br> their unstable nature, most are split into blue horrors or dissolved back down into their base arcane energies in short order. Those few pink terrors that manage to maintain their cohesion long enough to survive many battles and absorb sufficient amounts of arcane power may ascend in power to become the "exalted" members of their kind. 

Exalted pink terrors have more stable forms than their ordinary kin, allowing them to channel greater amounts of magical power when making their arcane assaults.

What's more, they can even channel <br> this power and use it to empower their allies, <br> granting them increased magical capabilities. However, should they be slain, they will split into two ordinary blue terrors as their coveted status slips from their grasp, and they are returned to the aether.

***The Blazing Terrors.*** All demons of change are tethered to the twisting home plain of their demonic masters, and when slain, this tether pulls their essence back to this realm for reabsorbtion. However, on rare occations, an exalted pink terror may form a connection several magnitudes stronger, thus becoming a walking portal to the realm of demonic change. Whether this process is a gift from a demon lord or the result of a weird cosmic anomaly is unknown. 

\columnbreak


All that is known is that this connection allows the terror to channel a seemingly endless supply of arcane energy through the rift of blazing light it carries with it.

The rift these blazing terrors carry makes them valuable allies to other magic users and highly sought after by mad wizards seeking a source of infinite arcane energy. However, the rift they carry is as unstable as the terror, and most who greedily exploit this power source end up torn asunder by the infinite power within.

***Pink Terror Commanders.*** The most powerful and longest-lived of the pink terrors may eventually stabilize to the point that they develop a sense of individuality and become able to command others of their kind. These pink terrors are stable to the point that they no longer split into blue terrors when slain, and this stability allows them to form more cohesive thoughts and personalities, which in turn allows them to channel more sophisticated forms of magic. The lesser demons of this kind are known as iridescent terrors, while the most powerful are referred to as heralds of change and often carry out the will of powerful demon lords.

These commanders draw power from the warping effect of other demons of change and are able to use this power to augment the eldritch power of their kin. Using their weird power, they can regenerate and stabilize the forms of other demons, boost their magical abilities, or even recycle the aether of slain demons to create new terrors. The presence of these demonic commanders ensures their eldritch forces will be as powerful as they are unpredictable.

#### Locus of Change Abilities
The terrors who serve as commanders draw power from the chaotic winds of magic and pass that power onto the demons they lead. Every iridescent terror and herald of change has one of the following abilities.

***Locus of Abjuration.*** The terror and each demon of change within 30 feet of it gains 5 temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns.
 
 ***Locus of Evocation*** The terror and demons of change within 30 feet of it gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of their spells.

***Locus of Transmogrification*** Whenever the terror or a demon of change with a CR 1 or higher within 30 feet of the terror dies, a *brimstone terrors of change* appear in the unoccupied spaces closest to where the demon died.

### Terror of Change Tactics
Pink terrors should group together to maximize their Growing Flames trait, slowly advancing toward the enemy as they become wounded. When they split, the blue and brimstone terrors will move into melee range. Even unwounded pink terrors should move closer to keep benefitting from Growing Flames, as blue and brimstone terrors will still trigger this ability.

#### Sour and Bursting Terrors
Sour terrors follow the same tactics as pink and blue terrors, but will use Death Rush when they have 26 or fewer hit points, aiming to explode within the largest enemy group. Bursting terrors will use Death Rush if they can hit two or more targets.

\columnbreak

#### Chromatic and Prismatic Terrors
With high resistance to elemental damage and the Chromatic Spawning ability, chromatic and prismatic terrors will typically target non-spellcasters, who pose a greater threat.

#### Exalted Pink Terrors of Change
Exalted terrors can use the Arcane Mirth ability instead of attacking to empower a more powerful ally, such as an iridescent terror, or to reposition enemies away from advantageous spots.

#### Blazing Squealers
Blazing squealers can use both Conduit of Infinity and Greater Arcane Mirth to create devastating, high-accuracy attacks. If other blazing squealers or stronger demons are present, they will use these abilities to empower the stronger demon. Blazing squealers will only empower themselves if they have 40 or more hit points, as they likely won’t survive long enough to benefit otherwise.

#### Iridescent Terrors and Heralds of Change
These demons should be accompanied by other Demons of Change to benefit from their Locus ability. You can use the following guidelines when determining how to use their spells:

**Glean Magic:** Used immediately on the first full caster they see.

**Fireball/Fire Storm:** Cast if two targets with low Dexterity saves can be hit, or if three or more such targets can be hit (in which case this should be used before Glean Magic).

**Bolt of Change:** Targets creatures with low Charisma saving throws. The odds of hitting should be boosted by weaker minions (e.g., Blue or Brimstone Terrors) using the Help action or an Exalted Terror using Arcane Mirth.


##### Locus of Change Abilities
&emsp;**Locus of Abjuration.**  The terror and its minions within the locus should use hit-and-run tactics, attempting to make sure they do not take too much damage in one turn. 

**Locus of Evocation.** Does not greatly affect the terror's tactics

**Locus of Transmogrification.** This locus is most dangerous when paired with swarms of other demons. The brimstone terrors spawned from this ability can be used to boost the terror's Growing Flames ability.

### Terrors of Change Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

In the case of terrors of change that split into smaller demons when slain, the players must slay all the lesser forms to gain the loot of the original demon.


#### Terrors of Change Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Screechers of Change


Screechers of change are demons who've earned their names by the terrifying screeches they unleash as they soar through the sky toward their prey. They take the form of immense, airborne manta rays twisted by unnatural mutations. Their bodies glide effortlessly through the skies, and the edges of their expansive wings are lined with razor-sharp fins capable of slicing through armor and flesh with ease. Their wide mouths are filled with rows of serrated teeth, ready to rend both the physical and aetheric forms of their victims.

These creatures operate on instinct and are attracted to the aetheric energies generated by magic and intense emotions. Whether it's a sorcerer channeling arcane powers, a battlefield charged with fury and fear, or places steeped in lingering magical residue, all serve as beacons to the screechers. Upon sensing such energies, they become relentless hunters, diving from the heavens with terrifying speed and precision. They not only inflict grievous physical wounds but also consume the very essence of their prey, feeding on the aetheric energy that sustains them.

When forces of demonic change mobilize for war, screechers of change are never far behind. The tumult of conflict amplifies the energies they crave, providing a veritable feast. Their eerie, piercing screeches reverberate across the battlefield, sowing fear and chaos among friend and foe alike. As they soar over the clamor of war, they single out the most potent sources of aetheric energy, be it mighty spellcasters or warriors engulfed in emotion, further fueling the cycle of destruction.

Embodiments of insatiable hunger and perpetual metamorphosis, screechers of change grow more unpredictable and dangerous with every essence they consume. The chaotic energies they absorb drive their own continual transformation, resulting in ever more fearsome mutations. The sight of their dark silhouettes blotting out the sun is an omen of upheaval, signaling that the forces of change are in motion and that few will escape their ravenous pursuit.

***Thunderous Screechers.*** Among the various mutant variants of the screechers, thunderous screechers are especially dreaded. This formidable variant possesses the ability to project magical sonic blasts as they glide through the air. With each movement, they harness aetheric energies to emit concussive waves of sound that can shatter stone and rupture eardrums. Thunderous screechers use this power to amplify the chaos of battle. Their approach is often preceded by a rising cacophony, an ominous symphony that heralds the havoc they are about to unleash. In the midst of conflict, their sonic blasts can turn the tide by sending their foes flying with waves of thunderous energy, making them unpredictable forces of devastation on any battlefield.

### Discs of Change

Discs of change are screechers that powerful demons or sorcerers have transformed to serve as flying, demonic mounts. Through arcane rituals and dark enchantments, these beings are reshaped into flattened, iridescent disks adorned with swirling, otherworldly patterns. This metamorphosis harnesses the chaotic essence of the screechers, converting them into obedient steeds for the most devoted followers of transformation.

Retaining their razor-sharp fins along the edges, discs of change glide through the air with remarkable speed and agility. Riders stand atop them, seamlessly connected through a fusion of willpower and mastery over shifting aetheric energies. This bond allows for swift aerial maneuvers and assaults from unexpected angles, giving their riders a significant advantage in combat.


On the battlefield, riders of discs of change can bypass terrain obstacles, execute surprise attacks, and retreat with unparalleled swiftness. From their elevated positions, they unleash spells or ranged attacks, spreading fear and confusion among enemy ranks. The mere sight of these airborne warriors mounted on their eerie disks instills dread, symbolizing the intentional harnessing of chaos by those who command it.

***Discs of Immolation.*** Discs of immolation are an even more fearsome variant of the discs of change, specifically enhanced by powerful demons or sorcerers to unleash jets of searing warpfire upon foes below. These demonic mounts retain the swift agility and razor-edged fins of their predecessors but are imbued with the ability to channel chaotic flames. As they soar over battlefields, they rain down torrents of warpfire that can incinerate all in their path. The warpfire they emit is not ordinary flame; it is infused with chaotic energy that twists and mutates its victims. Riders of these fiery disks harness this destructive power to devastating effect, turning the skies into a blazing panorama of chaos and destruction.

### Burning Chariots of Change

Chariots of change are awe-inspiring and fearsome war machines employed by the most powerful agents of transformation. These magical flying chariots are typically pulled by screechers of change, bound through arcane rituals to serve the will of their masters. As they soar through the skies, they leave behind trails of burning warpfire, casting an eerie, otherworldly glow that illuminates the heavens. From a distance, they appear as ominous comets blazing across the firmament, heralding upheaval and chaos. The warpfire not only serves as a visual spectacle but also acts as a weapon, scorching anything unfortunate enough to be caught beneath their fiery wake. Riders of these chariots command immense power, using their elevated position to unleash spells, direct forces, and sow disorder among enemy ranks. 

### Screecher of Change Tactics
Screechers will disengage if they can move past three or more targets. They will attack if they can avoid effective opportunity attacks, targeting creatures with high AC or large size.

#### Thunderous Screecher
Thunderous Screechers follow similar tactics but prioritize flying past melee fighters when disengaging. They may save their bite attack for creatures capable of making effective opportunity attacks. They will use *thunderwave* if it can hit three or more targets or help it avoid opportunity attacks.

#### Discs of Change
Discs of Change serve as mounts for spellcasters and use their high mobility to target enemies with high AC, though the disc itself deals minimal damage with its attacks.

\columnbreak

##### Discs of Immolation
Discs of Immolation do not stay in prolonged combat. They fly in to attack, recharge their Searing Torment, and then fly back out of reach.

A creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there and must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw suffer a mutation (Mutation Save DC 14).

> ***Flame Charge.*** Each steed may make a melee weapon attack against each creature it is facing within 5 feet of it. If the chariot moves at least 20 feet in a straight line before the attacks are made, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage and, on hit, must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw suffer a mutation (Mutation Save DC 14).

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.

### Screecher of Change Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check.  

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Screecher of Change Loot Tables
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Flamers of Change

These bizarre demons are malevolent embodiments of magic and its chaotic nature. Flamers of change float through the air, with gouts of fire erupting from where their legs would be, propelling them in any direction they desire. Despite their ability to float, they cannot truly fly; instead, they glide through the air while floating just above the surface of the ground.

Their bodies shimmer with hues of blue and purple while gnashing mouths and leering eyes are haphazardly strewn across their forms. The only limbs to present are two long arms ending in twisted months. Flamers derive their name from the chaotic fires that erupt from their mouths, known as warp flame. This warp flame is not true fire but chaos in its purest form, and anything it touches is subjected to rapid mutation as the orderly laws of the multiverse are quickly broken down.

Flamers of change possess no guile and ambition of their own. They are more akin to magical elementals than the other scheming demons of change. Flamers might spawn in locations where other demons have wrought significant havoc on the fabric of reality. Other times, powerful demons or deranged mortals summon flamers to sow chaos amongst their enemies.

Only the most powerful of wills can control a flamer of change, for once it is set loose upon the world, it cares for nothing but causing chaos for the sake of chaos.

***Exalted Flamers of Change.*** Some flamers of change are gifted with a greater spark of fiendish sentience by their demonic masters. These "exalted flamers" possess greater magical abilities and more potent warp flame capable of mutating even the hardiest of foes. This enhanced sentience also allows them to develop primitive personalities, and over time, many begin to take malicious glee in the chaos they cause. Some even learn to direct other lesser demons or utilize demonic steeds and chariots. These flamers become menaces in combat, covering the battlefield in huge swaths of warp flame as they hunt down their victims atop their twisted steeds.

### Flamers of Change Tactics

Flamers avoid stacking mutations on a single target and instead spread their attacks and spells across multiple enemies. They prioritize using Flame Blast on low-AC targets and cast spells when they can hit three or more targets or two with low Dexterity saves. Exalted Flamers only use *fireball* if they can hit one extra target, as it deals less damage than their other spells.

## Masters of Change

Masters of change are terrifying embodiments of deceit, manipulation, and reality-warping sorcery. Towering above most beings, they appear as large, anthropomorphic birds with immense, feathered wings that shimmer with otherworldly colors. Their long, vulturous necks often twist and crane unnaturally, ending in cruel, sharp beaks that seem to glisten with malice. Masters of change are notorious for their physical unpredictability, as their bodies are riddled with mutations. Some boast additional limbs or elongated talons, while others possess two or more heads, each whispering secrets of ancient power. These deformities only enhance their aura of chaos, making it clear that they are beings not bound by the laws of reality.

As fiendish masterminds, masters of change spend every moment of their existence pursuing forbidden knowledge and plotting their convoluted schemes. Their intelligence is vast, and their hunger for power is insatiable. They weave grand, labyrinthine schemes that span centuries, using mortals as mere pawns in their games. By playing on the desires, fears, and ambitions of lesser beings, these demons subtly guide the actions of kings, wizards, and heroes, all the while maintaining the illusion that their followers are acting on their own volition. In reality, the mortals who believe they have been granted knowledge and power to achieve their dreams are little more than unwitting pieces in the master of change’s intricate, multiverse-spanning play.

The magical prowess of a master of change is unrivaled. Their deep connection to the fundamental weave of magic allows them to perceive, manipulate, and reshape it with almost no effort. To them, the weave of magic is no more difficult to navigate than the strings of a harp are to a seasoned musician. This innate talent makes them some of the most powerful spellcasters in existence, capable of bending reality to their will. They specialize in spells of mutation, illusion, and chaos, using their abilities to disrupt the natural order and further their inscrutable plans. Few mortal mages can hope to stand against their overwhelming magical presence.

Exalted masters of change are even more terrifying, rare beings among their kind that have ascended to levels of power unfathomable to most. These exalted versions are often marked by an even greater array of mutations, and their magical control extends far beyond the material world allowing them to twist all types of magic into tools at their disposal. Capable of shaping entire realms and bending time and space, they are the very essence of change and chaos. When an exalted master of change appears, the natural order itself recoils in horror, for these beings represent the absolute peak of demonic influence, and even the mightiest gods are forced to take note of their schemes.

### Powers of Change

The master of change can have two of the following traits (it has Capricious Warpflame and Twin Focus by default):

**Capricious Warpflame.** Fire damage dealt by the master ignores fire resistance. If the master hits a creature with an attack that deals fire damage or if the creature fails a saving throw against a spell cast by the master by 5 or more, the creature suffers a mutation (Mutation Save DC 21) (mutated condition described later in document).

**Duplicitous Simulacrum.** The master can use a bonus action to create a simulacrum copy of itself in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. The simulacrum lasts until it is more than 100 feet away from the master, or until another simulacrum is created. When the simulacrum is created, the master can seamlessly swap places with it.

The simulacrum shares the same initiative count as the master but can take its turn before or after the master. The simulacrum is an exact copy of the master, except it cannot take any actions on its turn, has 25 hit points, and loses the ability to cast spells. The master can make attacks and cast spells as if it were in the simulacrum’s space, using the simulacrum's senses, making it appear as if the simulacrum made the attack or cast the spell.



**Read Fate.** When the master rolls initiative or at the end of each of its turns, it can choose one creature within 120 feet that it is aware of and glimpse into its future. Until the end of the master's next turn, the master has advantage on all attacks made against that creature, and the creature has disadvantage on all attacks it makes against the master. Once the master uses this feature on a creature, that creature is immune to the effects of this ability for the next hour.

**Twin Focus.** The master can maintain concentration on two spells simultaneously. If it fails a concentration save while concentrating on two spells, it loses concentration on one of the spells of its choice.

### The Golden Master

Unlike other masters of change, this demon has a nearly regal bearing. His aven form is crisp and clean, and his feathers have a shining metallic quality to them. He wears an ornate garb with countless precious metals woven through it and carries a magnificent staff whose apparent cost could bankrupt a nation. From behind his golden mask, he promises any who will listen the means to obtain wealth beyond their wildest dreams. For this master of change has found a unique specialization that sets him apart from his kind: financial manipulation.

While all masters of change develop schemes that exploit mortal weakness, The Golden Master has found money to be one of the most effective ways to accomplish this. Money is an abstraction of wealth and, through financial manipulation, can quickly become divorced from tangible material value. The Golden Master excels at adding layers of complexity to large financial systems, making them increasingly convoluted, dysfunctional, and easier to exploit.

When The Golden Master influences mortals, he shows them how to twist and exploit markets to their advantage, developing new and inventive ways to subvert their intended function for selfish gain. These schemes range from simple pyramid schemes to the elaborate over-financialization of an entire nation's economy. While those who heed The Golden Master's influence reap massive economic gains, their success is unsustainable, as their methods eventually undermine the economy to the point of collapse.

  At this point, the illusion of their wealth becomes apparent as the elaborate conceptual monetary system disintegrates and their financial games become for naught.

The Golden Master's focus on wealth has resulted in his specialization in alchemical spellcraft. He is a master of transmutation and capable of conjuring seemingly precious metals. However, these creations are all faux metals, useless for any practical applications, and only bearing the superficial appearance of value.

This metallic magic is hardly limited to the creation of useless currencies; when pressed into direct confrontations, The Golden Master can unleash magical fires that cover his foes in molten gold. Many ruined merchants have met their end buried under waves of searing gold while attempting to exact vengeance on the demon who manipulated them. 

The searing gold has a perverse sentience of its own, and should it be scrapped off, it will quickly form into a demonic entity in service to The Golden Master. These golden terrors are a metallic variant of other demonic terrors of change and serve as The Golden Master's primary minions. When an entire kingdom experiences devastating financial collapse, there are sometimes those who learn of the culprit and seek the demon for vengeance, and in such cases, The Golden Master unleashes his metallic minions and searing magics to ensure all pay the price of avarice.

##### Master of Change Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |Over the past few days, a town has been subjected to an increasing number of mutations and magical anomalies, all heralding a **master of change's** arrival.|
|  2  |A scheming vizier has begun consulting with a **master of change**, unaware that the demon is using him to steer the course of the entire kingdom.    |
|  3  |An entire city has descended into madness, its grip on reality bleeding away as warped demons spill across the streets while a **master of change** flies overhead, orchestrating the grand show.     |
|  4  | An **exalted master of change** has torn a hole through the Material Plane, allowing it to call forth hordes of flamers and terrors of change in a mad tide of chaos.|
|  5  |A demon-worshipping cult of powerful merchants has begun entangling a kingdom in a financial scheme involving false currency. **The Golden Master** lies behind this scheme, hoping to bankrupt the kingdom and prevent them from posing a threat to his future schemes.   |
|  6  | Multiple **masters of change** have each covertly taken control of a different mortal nation or faction. Now, they pit their factions against each other in a great game of civilizations.|
### Masters of Change Tactics

Masters of Change make decisions with near-perfect knowledge of the enemy's capabilities. They cast the following spells based on situational need:

**Banishment**: Use if Dominate Monster has already been used.

**Bolt of Change:** Cast when AoE options are limited, and concentration is already used. Prioritized over Banishment if it has advantage on the attack roll.

**Counterspell:** Reactions are reserved to use this to disrupt enemy spells.

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when wounded (below 50 HP).

**Dispel Magic:** Cast when a high-level spell prevents it from acting.

**Dominate Monster:** Cast when there aren’t enough targets for AoE spells, and concentration is free.

**Fireball:** Cast when two or more low-Dexterity targets or three total targets are present, and concentration is already used.

**Firestorm:** Cast when three or more low-Dexterity targets or four total targets can be hit.

**Firewall:** Cast when two or more low-Dexterity targets or three total targets can be hit.

**Glean Magic:** Cast when no AoE spells are viable, and it’s concentrating on another spell.

**Invisibility:** Used for ambushes or if unable to teleport to safety.

**Prismatic Spray:** Same conditions as Firestorm.



\columnbreak



#### Exalted Masters of Change Tactics

Exalted masters of change have access to the Lore Strike legendary action and can use the following guidelines when deciding which lore to use:

**Fire:** The strongest option, especially with Warp Flame.

**Light:** Used on targets it plans to attack next turn.

**Beast:** Used when forced into melee and unable to escape.

**Metal and Life:** Pushes or pulls creatures into a *firewall* spell.

**Heavens:** Used on spellcasters concentrating on 4th-level or higher spells.

**Shadow:** Targets creatures more than 60 feet away.

**Death:** Targets low-HP creatures for potential knockouts on the next turn.

#### The Golden Griffin Tactics
The Golden Griffin has different spells compared to other Masters of Change and uses them with the following strategies in mind:

**Bolt of Change:** Cast when AoE spells aren’t effective, and the Griffin is already concentrating on other spells. This spell is prioritized over Banishment if it has advantage on the attack roll.

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when the Griffin is badly wounded (below 50 HP).

**Dispel Magic:** Used when a spell is preventing the Griffin from taking its full action.

**Dominate Monster:** Cast when there aren't enough targets for AoE spells, and the Griffin is not concentrating on the maximum number of spells. It will attempt to hit the creature with its staff before casting this spell.

**Final Transformation:** Targeted at spellcasters, preferably those who cannot cast Greater Restoration.

**Firestorm:** Cast when it can hit three or more targets with low Dexterity or four targets overall.

**Fire Wall:** Cast when it can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity or three targets overall.

**Glean Magic:** Cast when there are not enough AoE targets, and the Griffin is already concentrating on a spell. Targets for Bolt of Change may also be selected.

**Molten Silver:** Used when it can hit two or more low-Dexterity targets or three targets overall, and the Griffin is already concentrating on the maximum number of spells.

**Plague of Rust:** Used to target the weapons of martial classes when there aren't enough AoE targets and the Griffin is concentrating on spells.

**Invisibility:** Utilized for ambushing, or when the Griffin cannot teleport away to safety.

##### Legendary Actions
The Golden Griffin uses its Golden Bolt as frequently as possible. It uses Searing Gold whenever there are multiple targets covered in gold.

### Master of Change Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Master of Change Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## The Fateweaver

The Fateweaver is a two-headed master of change, regarded as the most powerful and enigmatic of his kind. The Fateweaver's power was always great, but it was after a cataclysmic event that he transcended even the limits of demonic existence. Cast into an eternal, formless realm beyond space and time—an expanse where even gods fear to venture—The Fateweaver was left to wander the madness of the void. When he eventually returned, he was irrevocably changed.

Now, The Fateweaver’s two heads grant him extraordinary sight. His left head can perceive the entirety of the past, down to every insignificant detail, with perfect clarity. He can unravel the threads of history, understanding every cause and effect that has ever unfolded. His right head, on the other hand, peers into the endless possibilities of the future, tracing potential outcomes and paths as effortlessly as breathing. This dual perception makes him a living repository of cosmic knowledge, able to foresee events and recall ancient truths that no other being could comprehend.

Yet, this incredible gift comes with a curse. Neither of his heads can perceive the present. Trapped between the certainty of the past and the infinite possibilities of the future, The Fateweaver cannot truly experience the moment he exists in. Instead, he must infer his current place in time by comparing what has been to what will be.

This unique limitation drives him to calculate every move with unparalleled precision, as his actions must be shaped by his perfect understanding of what came before and what may come after.

Within his demonic realm, The Fateweaver sits as an oracle of dark knowledge. He whispers secrets gleaned from the maddening depths of the place that once consumed him, and lesser masters of change flock to his side, eager to collect the forbidden insights he offers. They circle him like moths drawn to flame, knowing that even a single word from The Fateweaver might unlock powers they could scarcely dream of. These whispers spread across realms, and his influence expands, despite his isolation, as those who crave power come to listen to his cryptic prophecies.

When The Fateweaver leaves his realm, it is never for trivial reasons. He ventures forth only to orchestrate the grandest of schemes, using his unparalleled vision of the past and future to manipulate the world toward his inscrutable goals. To him, every event is but a piece of a vast, multiversal puzzle, and he is the only one who understands the shape it must take. His spells are as varied as the knowledge he holds, effortlessly cast to manipulate fate, twist reality, and reshape the destiny of all who stand in his way. To oppose The Fateweaver is to fight against the very fabric of time and reality itself.

### The Fateweaver's Lair
The Fateweaver is makes his lair in archives of eldridge knowledge and power. These temporary locations range from arcane libraries to grand observatories or long-forgotten crystalline fortresses. Wherever he settles, it doesn't take long for the intensity of The Fateweaver's presence to twist his new surroundings, causing reality to fray.


#### Regional Effects
Any region where The Fateweaver dwells for a significant amount of time becomes warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects within 5 miles of his lair:

* Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 8 or higher that can speak at least one language finishes a long rest in the area, it may cast either the *commune* or *legend lore* spell once, using Intelligence as its spellcasting modifier, while it remains in the area.
* The Fateweaver becomes aware of any information gained through the use of divination spells cast in the area.
* If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into madness, as determined by the Madness of Fateweaver table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

##### Madness of Fateweaver
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |I obsess over future events, constantly trying to manipulate circumstances to achieve my desired outcomes. |
|  2  | I am infatuated with past events, needing to understand every painful detail of what happened. |
|  3  | I become overwhelmed by choices and their potential future consequences, often feeling paralyzed when it's time to make a decision. |
|  4  | I obsess over past events, replaying them over and over in my mind. |

#### Lair Actions
While in his lair, The Fateweaver's challenge rating increases by 5.

When The Fateweaver rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or The Fateweaver dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 25 and can act on its own accord, always acting in The Fateweaver's best interest. While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair casts one of the spells listed below. 

\columnbreak

A spell cast this way ends on initiative count 20 of the next turn, and the lair can't cast the same spell again (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks) for the next hour, or it can (NOTE: cant or can't?) cast a spell that one of The Fateweaver's heads is currently concentrating on.

* Bestial Spirit (6th level)
* Flame Cage
* Horrifying Laughter
* Net of Light
* Pit of Shadows
* Plague of Rust (6th level)
* Storm Sphere (6th level)
* Wall of Thorns

### Epic Fateweaver Battle
If you wish to make The Fateweaver into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 804 hit points, and give him the Chaos Caster ability. This increases his CR to 28.

***Chaos Caster (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the Fateweaver is reduced to half his hit points (402) or less, he may end any effects incapacitating or preventing him from casting spells. Both heads may then immediately cast *chaos storm* without any components (no action required). Both heads are concentrating on the spell and can use their actions to open gates. The spell only ends once both heads have stopped concentrating on the spell.

### Exiled One Adventure Hooks
The following adventure hooks can provide you with some ways to include The Exiled One in your campaigns.

##### The Exiled One Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Past Undone.** Powerful enemies the players defeated in their past return, claiming they were never truly vanquished. The players discover The Fateweaver altered the timeline, and they must confront him to restore the true past.|
|  2  | **The Vanishing Present.** The players find themselves in a world where the present moment keeps disappearing, flickering between realities. As they investigate, they realize The Fateweaver is experimenting with time, and they must confront him to stabilize their world. |
|  3  | **Future Proofed.** The players discover a prophecy of an impending disaster orchestrated by The Fateweaver. They must locate him and prevent the event, but their every action seems to align with his grand plan. |
|  4  | **Stolen Sight.** An oracle’s visions have vanished, stolen by The Fateweaver in an attempt to see the present. The players must retrieve her power by venturing into his chaotic realm and navigating its ever-shifting reality. |

### The Fateweaver Tactics

The Fateweaver's two heads—Right Head and Left Head—have distinct spell selections. The Right Head always acts before the Left Head. The Fateweaver typically attempts to hit a target with his staff before casting spells.

#### Right Head

&emsp;**Plague of Rust:** Cast when it can affect three or more magical weapons belonging to martial classes.

**Net of Light:** Cast when it can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity saving throws, setting up future AoE spells by giving disadvantage on Dexterity saves.

**Wall of Thorns:** Used when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Storm Sphere:** This spell can be used more generally, and both heads can use the bonus action associated with Storm Sphere.

**Dimensional Warp:** Can be used to escape from combat or, preferably, reposition enemies into dangerous spell areas.

#### Left Head
&emsp;**Pit of Shadows:** Cast when it can hit two or more low-Dexterity targets or disrupt spellcasters concentrating on spells.

**Flame Cage:** Used when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Wall of Thorns:** Cast under the same conditions as the Right Head, when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Horrifying Laughter:** Targets a creature with a low Wisdom saving throw and within range of two other creatures.

#### Both Heads

&emsp;**Chromatic Orb:** Used when either head is concentrating on a spell.

**Glean Magic:** Cast when there aren’t enough AoE targets, but concentration is already active, and there is (NOTE: you mean isn't?) a clear target for Chromatic Orb.

**Dispel Magic:** Cast when a spell is preventing The Fateweaver from taking its full actions.

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when The Fateweaver is badly wounded (below 50 HP).

**Invisibility:** Utilized for ambush tactics or when The Fateweaver cannot teleport to safety.

#### Lair Actions

The Fateweaver's lair utilizes its spells in the same strategic way that the Fateweaver would, aiding his efforts during battle.

#### Epic Encounter Tactics 
During an epic encounter, The Fateweaver prioritizes using his actions to open portals with *chaos storm*.

### Fateweaver Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### The Fateweaver Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### The Fateweaver Loot Table

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 | Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1d4(2) 20,000gp Items |
|  10-14 | 1d6(3) 20,000gp Items | 
|  15-25 | 1 100,000gp Item  |  
|  26+ | 1d4(2) 100,000gp Items |  


#### Example Fateweaver Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Legendary/Mythic Demon of Change Item Names
|1d10 | 20,000gp Item | 100,000gp Item
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1-2 <br> (Bone)  |  Warping Greater God Bone | Fateweaver's Skull |
| 3-4 <br> (Fluid)  | Warping Divine Blood | Fateweaver's Blood |
| 5-6 <br> (Flesh)  |  Warping Greater God Flesh | Fateweaver's Heart |
| 7-8 (Hide)  |  Scintillating Greater God Feathers | Fateweaver's Wing |
| 9-10 <br> (Metal) | Masterwork Divine Armaments | Fateweaver's Armaments |

# Gifts of Change
This section lists options for customizing creatures with abilities associated with the demonic forces of change. By using these options, you can incorporate creatures not normally associated with these forces into adventures centering on demons of change. These creatures could be worshippers of change, or they may have been twisted by chaotic magics that altered them and granted new powers.

## Abilities of Change

This section lists different abilities you can add to creatures to make them more thematically aligned with a demonic theme. Each ability added to a creature increases its CR by 1. Though this isn’t an exact science, as different abilities will synergize better with some creatures than others, so use your best judgment.

A creature with a demonic ability is considered to be a creature of that ability’s theme, ex a creature with a demonic ability from the decay theme is a Creature of Decay.

Some of these abilities will require a saving throw. Use the CR of the creature with the ability to determine the DC for the save, as shown below:

* CR 4 or lower - DC 13 
* CR 5 to 8 - DC 15
* CR 9 to 12 - DC 17
* CR 13 to 16 - DC 18
* CR 17+ - DC 19



#### Chaos Warp
*The creature may randomly be struck by extreme change, causing it to rapidly morph into an entirely new creature.*

When granting a creature this gift, choose a creature stat block with a CR equal to this creature's CR (including the boost in CR due to this gift.)

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, if it has dealt damage to a hostile creature since its last turn, it rolls a d6. On a roll of 4 or 6, the gifted creature is incapacitated, and its speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn. At that point, it instantly transforms into the chosen creature at full health and loses this ability.


#### Mystic Acceleration

*The creature’s spells defy the laws of entropy, gaining speed the further they travel.*

When the gifted creature makes a ranged spell attack, it gains a +1 bonus to the attack roll for every 20 feet between it and the target, up to a maximum of +3.

#### Mirror Double

*The creature can create an illusionary doppelganger to confound foes.*

At the start of the gifted creature's turn, it can create an illusory duplicate of itself as if created by the *mirror image* spell (no action required). The AC of the duplicate is equal to the gifted creature's gift save DC. The gifted creature can only have one of these duplicates at a time.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Nexus of Fate

*The creature's magic can twist the destinies of those it affects, swapping one fate for another.*

When the gifted creature casts a spell that forces multiple creatures to make a saving throw, it can choose two creatures that are making a saving throw against the spell. One of the chosen creatures makes the saving throw with advantage, and the other makes the saving throw with disadvantage.

#### Over-Channel
*The creature can draw massive amounts of arcane power through its spells to lay its foes low.*

When the gifted creature casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to channel greater amounts of eldritch power for as long as it concentrates on the spell. While channeling, at the start of each of the creature's turns, the spell save DC of the spell being concentrated and it's spell attack modifier are increased by 2, to a maximum of 6.

#### Twisting Flames

*Creature lets sets it's foes ablaze with corrupting fire, warping it's body.*

 Once during the gifted creature's turn, it may choose one creature that it dealt damage to make a DC Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers a mutation.

## Lair Actions <br> of Change

This section lists different lair actions you can give gifted creatures access to when they’re fighting at a location under the demonic influences of change.

These may be locations warped by chaotic magic, arcane sanctums containing eldritch knowledge, or hideouts used by deceptive trickster cults. Those aligned with the dark influences of these locations can draw on their power to lay their enemies low.

You can give one or more creatures the ability to access two or more lair actions listed in this section that all belong to the same theme. Only one creature can take a lair action per round. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any creature with lair actions can take one lair action.

When you add lair actions to an encounter, you can treat the lair as an additional creature being added for the purposes of determining how it increases the encounter’s challenge rating. The equivalent CR of the lair depends on the average level of the players, as shown in the table below. If a lair action requires a saving throw, the DC of the save is determined by the equivalent CR of the lair. 

##### Lair Challenge Ratings (CRs)
| Party Level Range  | Lair CR | Lair Save DC |  
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1-4  | 1 | 13 |
|  5-8  | 2 | 15 |
|  9-12 | 3 |  17 |
|  13-16| 4 |   18 |
| 17-20 | 5 |  19 |

#### Arcane Surge

The gifted creature calls upon magics that begin to swirl around itself out to a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area is magically empowered until the end of its next turn. While empowered this way, the next time the creature rolls damage for a spell, it can roll an additional number of d8s equal to the lair's CR and add them to the damage roll.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Bolt of Mutation

A bolt of mutating energy flashes down on a non-demon creature of the gifted creature’s choice within the lair that the it is aware of. The targeted creature and each non-demon creature within 5 feet of it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers a mutation. If only one creature makes the saving throw this way, it has disadvantage, as all the energy is focused on it. If three or more creatures make the saving throw, they make their saving throws with advantage.


#### Demonic Mirage 

The gifted creature creates a floating, spectral demonic image in a 10-foot cube within the layer that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn. Before it disappears, it may move up to 40 feet, and each creature it passes through or enters its space must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature can only take this damage once per use of the lair action.

A creature that uses an action to examine the demonic image can determine that it is an illusion by succeeding on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against the save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, it automatically passes any saving throw against this lair action and future uses of it.

* **CR 1:** - 2d8 psychic damage
* **CR 2:** - 4d8 psychic damage
* **CR 3:** - 6d8 psychic damage
* **CR 4:** - 8d8 psychic damage
* **CR 5:** - 8d10 psychic damage.

#### Living Flames

The gifted creature creates a storm of pink and blue flames in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within the lair that lasts until this lair action is used again, and the creature chooses a direction for it. When the storm appears, each creature in it must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there. 

The flames move 20 feet in the chosen direction on initiative count 20 of each turn after it has been summoned.

The fire damage dealt is based on the lair's CR:

* **CR 1:** - 1d8 fire damage.
* **CR 2:** - 2d8 fire damage.
* **CR 3:** - 3d8 fire damage.
* **CR 4:** - 4d8 fire damage.
* **CR 5:** - 5d8 fire damage.


#### Sigil of Change

The user causes a sigil of warping energy to appear in an unoccupied 5-foot cube within the lair that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn. The sigil has malevolent intelligence (Intelligence equal to that of the gifted creature) and has true sight out to 30 feet. When the sigil appears and when it disappears, it can force a creature within 30 feet of it to make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation.

#### Tome of Power

The gifted creature calls forth a floating tome of dark magic that binds to a creature of its choice. The tome follows the chosen creature wherever it goes and occupies the same space as the creature. On initiative count 20 of the next turn, a creature bound to the tome may cast a spell with a casting time of one action without expending a spell slot or daily use of the spell (no action required). The maximum spell level of this spell is determined by the CR of the gifted creature. Regardless of whether the spell is cast, the tome disappears at this point.

The tome is no longer bound to a creature if it dies, falls unconscious, or leaves the lair. If a creature within 5 feet of the tome uses its action to bind to the tome, it becomes bound to that creature. If the tome is already bound to a creature who does not wish to part with it, a contested Intelligence check is made, and the tome binds to the winner.

The maximum spell level of the spell cast by the tome is equal to the lair's CR.

## Customizable Demons

The following demons aren’t specifically aligned with the forces of decay but can be used as a baseline for adding gifts of decay and other customizations to make them a part of your forces of decay. 

### Chaos Fury

These wicked, winged demons personify the unpredictable and volatile nature of chaos. They stand roughly three to four feet tall, with lean, muscular bodies that can take on various appearances depending on the influence of the demons they serve. Their wide, leathery wings grant them impressive speed and agility in flight, while their long, sharp claws allow them to easily slice through vulnerable flesh. 

Chaos furies are believed to be lesser demons, birthed from the raw energies of the realm of chaos. Their malleable and subservient nature means they are often used as agents of chaos by more powerful demons, sowing discord and confusion before a larger demonic incursion. Despite their small size and seemingly low threat level, these creatures' unpredictable and opportunistic nature allows them to wreak havoc on larger enemies. Chaos furies are cowardly by nature and will wait until they see vulnerable or isolated foes before striking at lightning speed, using hit-and-run attacks to prevent their prey from mounting an effective counterattack.

Unlike many other demons, chaos furies have not been intentionally created by any of the chaos gods and do not embody any specific dark impulses beyond simple, chaotic malevolence. As such, they are blank slates easily molded to suit the whims of their more powerful masters and wide varieties of chaos furies exist with a multitude of different demonic gifts and unique powers.

### Daemon Prince

Daemon princes, known also as the Ascended, the Exalted, and the Chaos-Born, are among the most potent and feared entities in the multiverse. These dread figures tower over most mortal creatures, their forms a terrifying blend of the mortal and the infernal, an unholy testament to their fallen nature. Standing at least twice the height of a man, they are the epitome of strength and power, a monstrous fusion of bone, muscle, and dark magic.

Daemon princes were once mortal beings, individuals of such extraordinary ambition and wickedness that they caught the attention of the dark gods of the outer planes. These mortals were elevated to their current status as a reward for their exceptional service, often having led armies, toppled kingdoms, or committed atrocities beyond mortal comprehension.

Their forms vary greatly, reflecting the nature of the dark power they serve, their own inherent characteristics, and the mortal form they once possessed. Some daemon princes retain a semblance of humanoid form, albeit grotesquely warped and augmented, while others are monstrous, having multiple limbs, horns, wings, or other more bizarre features.
Daemon Princes possess immense physical strength and durability, far surpassing that of most mortal creatures. Many are also gifted with potent magical abilities that reflect their patron's nature and realm, such as tormenting the minds of their foes, spreading decay, or twisting reality. The exact nature and extent of their abilities can vary greatly from one daemon prince to another.

The path to ascension into daemonhood is fraught with danger and torment. Many who attempt it fall into madness or are consumed by the very powers they sought to master, and most followers of the dark gods simply die violent deaths before achieving the glory needed to earn the favor of their patron. However, those who succeed are granted immortality and power beyond mortal comprehension, becoming the right hand of their dark patron and a prince among daemons.

While a daemon prince is a terrifying opponent, it is also a cautionary tale, a stark reminder of the terrible price of ambition unbound and the seductive lure of ultimate power.

### Soul Grinder

Daemonic soul grinders are monstrous constructs, a terrifying fusion of daemon and machine, that exist only to harvest souls for the chaotic deities of the outer planes. These enormous entities tower over the battlefield, their forms a grotesque blend of flesh and blackened iron covered in spines, skulls, and runes of power.

Soul grinders are characterized by their enormous grinding limbs and mechanical weaponry, which they use to obliterate their foes and consume their souls. The upper bodies of these constructs often resemble the daemons that inhabit them, with a multitude of eyes, horns, and mouths, while their lower bodies are mechanical, often taking the form of a monstrous, spiked wheel or multiple-legged apparatus.

The creation of a doul grinder is a horrific process that involves binding a powerful daemon within the cold iron shell of the construct. This process often drives the daemon insane, resulting in a creature of uncontrolled rage and hunger. 
This process also involves equipping the demon with various weapons that are fused into their tortured forms. Each soul grinder comes with a different arsenal of weapons at its disposal, which dictates their preferred forms of combat. Some wield devesting blades and crushing claws, others trample their foes under their mechanical legs, and others bombard their foes from a distance with fiendish artillery.

This fate is said to befall demons who were defeated and unable to fully reform within their demonic plane. Desperate for another chance to wreak havoc, they made a bargain with fiendish smiths who forged them into new bodies. Only by repaying the smiths with a tremendous tally of souls harvested from the Material Plane can the soul grinders be fully restored to their original forms. Those who fail to do so risk becoming trapped in their mechanical forms for eternity. In a cruel form of irony, soul grinders demonstrate that even demons can be damned to a greater form of tortured existence.

## Example Custom Creatures 

These creatures have been warped by eldritch influences of demonic origin, making them unpredictable and granting them abilities that twist reality. They may worship gods of deception and sorcery, have been warped by chaotic, extraplanar energies, or have sacrificed their sanity in pursuit of deeper knowledge of the nature of reality. In battle, they ride the line between cunning and insanity. They are never straightforward with their tactics, preferring guile and trickery and finding ways to catch their opponents off guard whenever possible.

### Warp Devil (Barbed Devil)
This devil has had its essence twisted by raw chaos, turning it into an erratic version of its kind. Warp devils may try to continue their infernal services, but their twisted nature makes them an abomination in the eyes of their kin, and most eventually become mad vagabonds struggling to control their chaotic affliction. However, the devil’s innately lawful form can only contain this chaos for so long before succumbing to the flames of change. . . . . 


### Warpfire Elemental (Fire Elemental)
This elemental being has been created by demonic flames of chaos. Its flames don’t just burn matter but melt through the fabric of reality itself. Warpfire elementals are created during events of chaotic conflagration and seek to burn and warp every living being they come in contact with.

At that point, it instantly transforms into a **warpflame elemental** at full health and loses this ability.

### Oni Deceiver (Oni)

This oni has consorted with demonic forces of deception to access eldritch secrets and enhanced powers of trickery. It now serves those forces to sow chaos across the world, utilizing its arcane powers of confusion and deceit.

>
> ***Magic Weapons.*** The oni's weapon attacks are magical.

> 
> The AC of the duplicate is 13. The oni can only have one of these duplicates at a time.
>
> ***Over-Channel.*** When the oni casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to channel greater amounts of eldritch power for as long as it concentrates on the spell.

>
> ***Change Shape.*** The oni magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium humanoid, into a Large giant, or back into its true form. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. The only equipment that is transformed is its glaive, which shrinks so that it can be wielded in humanoid form. If the oni dies, it reverts to its true form, and its glaive reverts to its normal size.

### Sphinx, Defiler of Fate (Androsphinx)

No longer content to passively study the strands of fate, this sphinx has mastered the demonic arts necessary to twist destiny to its will. From within its sanctum, it studies the stands of destiny, scheming ways to twist the future to its will. Though it believes itself to have mastered fate, the sphinx is little more than another pawn in the game of the demonic lords who granted it this power to begin with.

### The Sphinx’s Lair

This lair is the sanctum from which the sphinx observes and twists the threads of fate. It is here where the sphinx’s power is greatest as it can twist reality to draw on greater reserves of magic and terrify its foes with nightmarish visions of different realities. 

This lair has an equivalent creature CR of 5. 

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the sphinx can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

##### Visions of Doom 

The sphinx creates a floating, spectral vision of futures too horrible to describe in a 10-foot cube within the layer that disappears on initiative count 20 on the next turn. 


\columnbreak

Before it disappears, it may move up to 40 feet, and each creature it passes through or enters its space must make a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw, taking 8d10 psychic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature can only take this damage once per use of the lair action.

A creature that uses an action to examine the visions can discern their intangible nature by succeeding on a DC 19 Intelligence (Investigation). If a creature discerns the visions for what they are, it automatically passes any saving throw against this lair action and future uses of it.

##### Tome of Power

The sphinx calls forth a floating tome of dark magic that binds to a creature of its choice. The tome follows the chosen creature wherever it goes and occupies the same space as the creature. On initiative count 20 of the next turn, a creature bound to the tome may cast a spell of 5th level or lower with a casting time of one action without expending a spell slot or daily use of the spell (no action required).

The tome is no longer bound to a creature if it dies, falls unconscious, or leaves the lair. If a creature within 5 feet of the tome uses its action to bind to the tome, it becomes bound to that creature. If the tome is already bound to a creature who does not wish to part with it, a contested Intelligence check is made, and the tome binds to the winner.

##### Arcane Surge

The sphinx calls upon magics that begin to swirl around itself out to a 10-foot radius. Each creature in the area is magically empowered until the end of its next turn. While empowered this way, the next time the creature rolls damage for a spell, it can roll an additional number of d8s equal to the lair's CR and add them to the damage roll.

> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**First Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.<br>

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
