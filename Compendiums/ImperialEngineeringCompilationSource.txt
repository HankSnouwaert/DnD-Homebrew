# Imperial Engineering Compilation
This document contains a compilation of firearm weapons, firearm feats, engineer NPC stat blocks, and a collection of advanced, blackpowder siege weapons. Most of the NPCs and weapons presented here are themed with the assumption that they were built in human-led civilizations, but you could reflavor them for use by other races. It is also assumed that blackpower weaponry and engineering exist within your campaign setting. If that is not the case, you could make these weapons rare relics of unknown or even supernatural origin that cannot be reproduced at scale. How you use these weapons and whether they are commonplace or one-of-a-kind relics depends entirely on the needs of your adventure and campaign setting.

# Firearms
The following is a list of new firearm weapons that can be added to your games at your DM's discretion. Firearms don't fit in all settings, and depending on the technology level in your setting, some or all of the weapons here may be limited in their availability. Alternatively, if blackpowder technology doesn't exist in your setting, they could be otherworldly items that can't be replicated, or their operation could be magical in nature.

## Firearm Weapon Properties 

&emsp; **Load(X)/Capacity(Y).** The weapon must be loaded with ammunition before it can be fired. Each piece of ammunition loaded into it must be done so using X Actions, or in place X attacks that are part of the Attack action or an off-hand weapon attack while duel-wielding. If X is less than 1, the weapon can be loaded with multiple pieces of ammunition at once (1/2 would be 2 at once, 1/3  would be 3 at once, etc.) 

The weapon can hold up to Y pieces of ammunition at a time.

**Rapid Fire.** If you take the Attack action on your turn while holding this weapon, you can make one additional attack with it as part of the same action. If you do, all attacks you make before the end of your turn must be made with this weapon. All attack rolls made this way are made with disadvantage, you automatically miss any attacks made at long range, and you can’t reload the weapon during this turn.

**Spread.** If you hit a creature with an attack roll using this weapon, you can make another attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first and within your weapon's range. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, but you don’t add your ability modifier to the damage unless that modifier is negative.


\columnbreak

&emsp;**Accurate.** Creatures proficient with this weapon gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with it. 

**Detonate.** When you hit or miss with an attack using this weapon, the target and each creature within a 10-foot radius of a point centered on the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 Piercing damage.
If you roll a natural 1 on the attack roll, you and each creature within a 10-foot radius of a point centered on you must make the saving throw instead.

The saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.

**Fire Glaive.** This weapon can be used to make ranged attacks using its Ammunition property. Attacks made this way deal 2d6 Piercing damage plus 2d6 Fire damage.

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* You gain proficiency with all Firearms.

* Before you make a ranged attack against a Large or larger target using a Firearm with the Detonate property, you can choose to take a -5 penalty to the attack roll. If the attack hits, instead of the normal effects of the Detonate property, the target takes an additional 5d8 Fire damage.

### Close-Quarters Gunner
 
Your rage allows you to bring doom with a wave of burning lead. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* You gain proficiency with all Firearms.

* When you make an attack with a Firearm that has the Two-Handed property, you can use your Strength modifier, instead of your Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls. You may also add your rage damage bonus if you are raging. 

* Once per turn, when you reload a Firearm with the Two-Handed property, you may also Shove a creature within 5 feet of you or make a melee attack with the opposite end of the weapon. The weapon deals Bludgeoning damage, and the weapon's damage die for this attack is a d4.

# New Creatures

## Engineers
*Eccentric Tinkerers Armed With Advanced Weaponry*<br>
**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** Individual <br>

Within the methodica districts of the great cities of the empires of order, where nobles and high merchants reside, can be found the chaotic workshops of eccentric engineers, shattering the refined formalities of those abodes. Such great thinkers, dismissed as uncouth by the upper ranks of society, pursue their obsessions with mad ingenuity and relentless determination, developing all manner of mechanical marvels while spending weeks in seclusion without rest. These endeavors are funded by wealthy nobles and imperial armies, both eager to capitalize on the next technological leap forward.

Such breakthroughs are unpredictable. Inspiration can strike engineers seemingly out of nowhere, sending them down paths that lead to convoluted and utterly useless contraptions. Yet, on occasion, these bursts of creativity yield weapons that can change the course of warfare for the nation.

Though most mechanically minded thinkers prefer isolation within their sanctums, surrounded by personal projects, some eagerly head to the battlefield with their newest contraptions of death to see their theoretical visions of destruction made real. Some bring personal devices to test, like the Mercurial Rifle, the Burning Tar Grenade Launcher, or the odd and gruesome Whirling Saw Blade, they are not trained soldiers.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Still, their study of ballistics and intimate knowledge of their creations’ inner workings allow them to wield them with deadly mastery.

### Master Engineer

Others oversee the operation of great war machines they have constructed, from rocket batteries to volley guns, standing among artillery crews, ranting about trajectory arcs and wind speeds. Most crewmen under an engineer’s command consider them arrogant, believing the inventors lack practical experience. Such opinions are swiftly redirected when a precisely calibrated projectile wipes out an entire enemy regiment in white-hot cotton fire, or a towering monstrosity is obliterated with a single, pinpoint strike.

The longest-lived engineers develop a second instinct for oncoming danger, whether from an enemy or their own dubious constructs. They can judge and evade incoming fire mere seconds after launch, sense the slightest disturbance in their handiwork, and leap aside before catastrophic failure. They also extract maximum lethality from their weapons, ensuring peak efficiency, whether unleashing a near-endless stream of bullets or loosing flocks of bomb-strapped pigeons. None but the greatest masters can unleash a steady chain of death in such a manner.

### Tools of Choice
An engineer has two of the following tool options that it can use as an Action using its Use Tool action:

**Mercurial Rifle.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 200/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (4d10 + 3) Piercing damage. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw.* <br>
*Failure:* 12 (4d6) Piercing damage.

**Burning Tar Grenade.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 100/300 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 4 (1d8 + 3) Bludgeoning damage. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw*.  
*Failure:* 18 (4d8) Fire damage and the target begins Burning, taking 4 (1d8) Fire damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends.

 **Repeater Gun.** The engineer makes three attacks with the following properties: <br>
*Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 100/300 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d8 + 3) Piercing damage.

**Pigeon Bomb (5/Day).** The engineer pulls out a **Pigeon**, attaches a 2-ounce tiny bomb to it (Tiny object; AC 10; 10 HP; immune to Poison and Psychic damage), and gives it a direction to start flying. The Pigeon acts on initiative count 1 (losing ties) and starts flying in the given direction. At the end of the pigeon’s next turn, the bomb falls off and detonates when it has fallen 60 feet or hits a solid surface, creature, or object.  
 Each creature within a 15-foot radius of the detonation must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw.*  
 *Failure:* 21 (6d6) Piercing damage.  
 *Success:* Half damage.

 **Thunder Barrel.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 45/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (4d8 + 3) Bludgeoning damage plus 22 (4d10) Thunder damage. The target must make a *Strength Saving Throw*.  <br>
 *Failure:* The target is pushed 20 feet away from the engineer.

**Spring-Loaded Mace.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 41 (7d10 + 3) Bludgeoning damage. The target must make a *Constitution Saving Throw.* <br> *Failure:* The target is *Dazed* until the start of the engineer’s next turn.

**Whirling Saw Blade.** The engineer makes three attacks with the following properties: <br> *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d8 + 3) Slashing damage, and the target suffers a Wound*.

**Electro-Netter.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (5d10 + 3) Lightning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is Restrained by a net (AC 15; 15 HP; immune to Poison and Psychic damage; escape DC Strength check) until the net is destroyed.





<br>

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

> ##### New Condition: Wounds
>While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
>
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

### Engineer Tactics
Engineers are best paired with self-propelled vehicles or other siege weapons, allowing them to leverage their Master Ballistics ability and Avert Disaster ability.

When choosing their weapons for the Tools of Choice feature, it's usually best to equip them with a long-range weapon and a close-range weapon.

* Most long-range attacks should target groups of enemies, as they typically have a blast radius.

* Close-range attacks should be reserved for enemies that slip past the Engineer's artillery.

The different tools are categorized based on their range below:

#### Long Range
* Mercurial Rifle
* Burning Tar Grenade
* Repeater Gun
* Pigeon Bomb
* Thunder Barrel

#### Short Range
* Spring-Loaded Mace
* Whirling Saw Blade
* Electro-Netter

## Clockwork Steeds
*Powerful, Yet Somewhat Unreliable, Crank-Powered Horses*<br>
**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** Individual <br>
Clockwork steeds are among the most temperamental marvels ever produced by engineers, automaton mounts forged of brass, steel, and stubborn optimism. Designed to replace living warhorses with tireless constructs, these machines clatter forward on articulated limbs driven by tightly wound spring-loaded pistons and clockwork gearing. Each must be wound by a heavy crank system, often mounted on the flank or beneath the saddle, requiring a great effort before the machine is ready to operate. Once fully primed, the steed surges to life in bursts of hissing steam and rhythmic clanking, capable of galloping at alarming speeds across open terrain.

Though awe-inspiring in motion, the steeds are notoriously difficult to manage. Engineers often struggle to coordinate their movements with the jerking gait of the automaton, and it is not uncommon for the steed to abruptly seize, stall, or lurch in the wrong direction when gears misalign. Some require periodic re-cranking mid-journey, leading to awkward battlefield pauses or frantic winding under fire. Despite these shortcomings, the clockwork steed represents the dream of replacing unreliable biology with engineered precision, and for those eccentric enough to ride them, they are a badge of honor and defiance against the limitations of nature.


### Clockwork Steed Tactics
Clockwork steeds with four or more charges should move in and out of combat to maximize their Slam feature.

If they have three or fewer charges:
* Stay in melee if winning the fight.
* Otherwise, flee, especially if carrying a rider who would be vulnerable.

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

\pagebreakNum



### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

* Goblin Artillery - Alex Horley-Orlandelli, Wizards of the Coast

\columnbreak

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

## Cannons
Cannons are the most abundant war machines among Imperial armies across the world. During the heat of battle, crews hastily reload and prepare the weapon to send iron projectiles streaking across the battlefield. A single shot is able to carve through enemy formations, leaving a bloody trail of broken bodies as it effortlessly barrels through. Even mighty monstrosities such as giants and dragons have tumbled to the ground from a well-placed hit from such artillery.

### Hammer of Fiends
These are the cannons commissioned by the great churches of the Empire for their holy crusades. Such weapons are forged on sacred holidays, overseen by a small group of clergymen who chant sacred gospel during the creation process; the iron that forms the bulk of the cannon is cooled in holy water. The exterior of the weapon is gilded and inscribed with prayers that wrap along the length of its barrel. When such a blessed relic is taken to war, it becomes a physical manifestation of the gods’ wrath, capable of threatening even the greatest of demons. When fired, an effulgent streak of light shoots across the battlefield, annihilating all in a holy blaze. Malevolent entities powerful enough to survive such smiting feel the judgment of the heavens weighing down upon them, hindering their vile magics and leaving them feeble.

### Iron Stelae
The dangerous work of crewing cannons breeds superstition. It is not uncommon for gunners to adorn themselves with good-luck charms or perform strange rituals while loading ammunition and handling gunpowder. Some crews, however, have pushed these practices to an extreme that borders on religious devotion. They nearly deify the cannons themselves and even consort with wizards who have devoted their lives to wielding the magic of death. To most outsiders, such beliefs are insane, even blasphemous. These groups are shunned by polite society and tolerated in imperial armies only because of their unmatched skill and terrifying effectiveness.

The most mystifying of their rites occurs when an entire crew perishes in battle. Surviving members of the cult gather the bodies, the cannon, and whatever cannonballs remain on the field. They bear everything to a secluded location and begin constructing a solemn burial site. A crypt is dug for the fallen, the cannon enshrined at its very heart. Cannonballs recovered from the battlefield are painstakingly carved with eulogies and wedged into niches cut into the chamber walls.

Such sepulchral memorials are scattered in hidden places across the land. Stranger still, when a new crew is initiated into this grim brotherhood, they seek out one of these tombs, exhume the ancient cannon, pry the inscribed cannonballs from the walls, and march once more to war.
Cannons raised from these grave sites, known as Iron Stelae, are feared and haunted things. Their shots defy all reason: the balls shift mid-flight as if guided by invisible, vengeful hands, curving impossibly to slam into foes they should have missed entirely. Some of these weapons have been handed down through generations of gunners. Each crew that inherits one knows the solemn pact: when their own time comes, they too must be interred in the same tomb from which the cannon was first taken. Some of the most archaic sites now contain the bones of dozens of different crews that have accumulated over the centuries. To break this cycle and fail to return both gun and gunners to the earth is to watch the weapon lose its deadly enchantment forever.

###  Canon Tactics
Cannon crews will load cannonballs when foes are at a greater distance, targeting large groups of enemies or structures. The cannon crew should be guarded by other capable melee allies. If the enemy is fast approaching and there are no allies to stop their advance, they will switch to using grapeshot.


#### Hammer of Fiends Tactics
A hammer of fiends will always focus on spellcasters first, attempting to Chastise them. Otherwise, it will target Fiends and Undead.

## Mortars
Mortars are stout, bulky weapons capable of launching hollow shells in high arcs that hurtle back down to earth, detonating on impact and sending shrapnel hurtling in every direction, shredding anyone unfortunate enough to be near the landing zone.

### Mortar of the Righteous
Particularly zealous and unhinged religious orders have devised an unorthodox instrument to purge the corrupted from among the pure: the Mortar of the Righteous. The weapon is crafted by Doomsayer Flagellants that were former gunsmiths whose minds were sundered by nightmarish trauma. These martyrs whip and beat themselves during the mortar's construction, allowing their blood and flayed skin to mingle with the metal, infusing the weapon with innate fanatical judgment. 

To complete this seraphic siege engine, it is loaded with hollow mortar shells filled with relics of former priests and holy men. These relics range wildly: talismans, prayer beads, and even the bones of pious individuals. When the missile crashes onto the battlefield, it scatters this assortment of hallowed trinkets. By some miracle, the shrapnel seems to miss the devotees of the faith entirely and instead embeds itself in the faithless, where the fragments burst into searing alabaster flame, consuming the sinner.

### Mortar Tactics
Mortars always focus on large groups of enemies or structures.

#### Mortar of the Righteous Tactics
A Mortar of the Righteous always fires into large clusters of enemies that are currently under attack by the mortar crew's allies, as the Burning condition will give the allies advantage on their attack rolls against the foes.

> ##### Not a Creature
> The mortar is a siege weapon and not a creature. Mechanics for siege weapons can be found in the Siege Weapons Section.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

## Rocket Batteries

Among the most volatile devices ever deployed by the great Imperial armies are the devastating rocket batteries. These were developed by a particularly reckless cadre of engineers who harboured a dangerous fondness for incendiary devices and who audaciously sought to push the boundaries of ballistic weaponry, blowing apart a sizable portion of their own academy in the process.
The ultimate result of this perilous endeavour is a wheeled cart topped with rows of rockets, strapped in place and ready to be ignited. Once lit, they soar into enemy formations in corkscrewing arcs, blasting men to smithereens. Yet for all its ability to turn the tide of battle, the weapon is far from foolproof. The rockets fly wildly and inaccurately; a missile may veer astray and miss its intended target entirely, or worse, plummet onto friendly troops.
Compounding the weapon’s turbulent dangers, the launching platform itself is notoriously unreliable. Many rockets fail to ignite and remain stuck in their tubes, requiring the crew to undertake the arduous and perilous task of removal. Even worse, a munition may detonate prematurely, triggering a catastrophic chain reaction that vaporises the battery and its crew in an instant.


### Sunmaker Rocket Battery

A modified and still more fearsome version of the standard rocket battery is the Sunmaker. It earns its name by unleashing an even greater torrent of rockets that rain down upon the landscape. Each missile contains a special alchemical mixture; upon detonation, it releases a blinding flash of light so intense that, for a few fleeting seconds, even a moonless night is turned as bright as midday. Any who survive the cascade of scorching light and soaring shrapnel are often left blinded, their sight stripped away.

##### Rocket Battery Mishap Table
| d8 | Mishap Name | Mishap Effect | Repair Check Type |
|:--:|:------------|:--------------|:------------------|
| 1 | Dud | The rocket does not fire. No further rockets are launched, and the weapon cannot be used until this mishap ends. | STR |
| 2-4 &emsp;&emsp; | Wildly Off Target | The rocket lands additional 2d4 × 5 feet away from the originally chosen point. | None |
| 5-7 | Early Detonation | The rocket explodes midair, producing no effect. | None |
| 8 | Kaboom! | The weapon explodes and is destroyed. The rocket detonates at a point centered on the Rocket Battery. | None |

### Dark Sun Rocket Battery

In far-off pastures stand macabre monuments to the harrowing conflicts that once raged there: rows of crystalline statues frozen in poses of crowing terror, strewn across the landscape. These figures are all that remain of warriors exposed to the Dark Sun rockets.

This dread variant can only be created by infusing spell scrolls scribed with the terrible Purple Sun incantation into the rocket frames, while the gunpowder itself must contain dust refined from victims already petrified by that same mighty spell. When fired, these rockets bathe entire battlefields in an eerie violet glow.

\columnbreak

Any soul caught within the full breadth of that luminance has only a few seconds to comprehend the grim fate that awaits them before they are transmuted.

To operate such a harbinger of doom, one must possess no love for one’s enemies and no regard for one’s own wellbeing, for the rockets are every bit as unstable as their common counterparts. For this reason, it is not uncommon to find the shattered remains of Purple Sunmaker batteries alongside the amethyst statues of their own crew, entombed together.


### Rocket Battery Tactics
Rocket batteries are so wildly inaccurate that they are best aimed at the largest group of enemies. Allies should avoid the area if possible.
