## Alternative Ranger Feature: Favored Foe
You can add the following features to the 2014 or 2024 Ranger. All the features should be added together as they effectively replace the functionality of the Favored Enemy feature. If a feature has the same name as an existing Ranger feature, its effects replace those of the original feature; otherwise, it should be added as a new class feature. 

Any other ranger features that interact with Favored Enemy do so with Favored Foe in the same way.
 
### Favored Foe
*1st-level ranger feature, which replaces the Favored Enemy feature*

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on a mystical bond to mark the target as your Favored Enemy for 1 minute.

When you hit the Favored Enemy (including the attack you used to mark it) and deal damage, you can increase that damage by 1d4.

You can use this ability twice. You regain one expended use of the feature on a Short Rest, and all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels (same number of uses as the 2024 Ranger). 

At each level that you gain an additional use of this feature, the damage die increases to the next highest die (1d6 at 5th, 1d8 at 9th, 1d10 at 13th, and 1d12 at 17th.)

### Relentless Hunter
*13th-level ranger feature*

If you roll initiative and have no uses remaining of your Favored Foe feature, you regain a use. Additionally, Favored Foe now lasts up to 8 hours.

### Precise Hunter 
*17th-level ranger feature*

You have Advantage on attack rolls against your Favored Foes.

### Level 20: Foe Slayer
*20th-level ranger feature*

You now roll 2d12 for your Favored Foe feature.

## Alternative Ranger Feature: Ranger Talents
This replaces their spell casting feature.

**Ranger Features That Grant Spells.** Any ranger feature that grants access to cantrips (such as the Druidic Warrior fighting style) or the ability to cast spells without using spell slots (such as the 2024 Favored Enemy feature) still grant the ranger the ability to cast those spells using the rules described in the ranger's Spellcasting feature.

### Hunter's Mark (& Favored Foe) Talents
The following talents give you access to the *hunter's mark* spell and offer ways to enhance it. (There's also an extra talent geared towards those using the Favored Foe feature from Tasha's Cauldron of Everything.)


#### Hunter's Marks  
You can cast *hunter's mark* X times without expending a spell slot. You regain all expended uses of this talent when you complete a Long Rest.

The *hunter's mark* spell no longer requires concentration and can't be dispelled or stopped with *counterspell*.
