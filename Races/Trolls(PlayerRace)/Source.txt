# Race: Trolls
Savage and terrifying, trolls stalk nearly every world in the D&D multiverse.  While there are many variations, even within a single world, trolls are usually monstrous creatures that prey upon helpless travelers and serve as adversaries to be slain by adventures.  
However, sometimes the occasional troll breaks away from the tendencies of its kin and strikes out to make its own fate, often becoming a wandering adventurer.  In some settings, trolls overall are less monstrous and prone to evil, resulting in many who regularly interact with other races and take up a life of adventuring. While these troll adventurers typically lack the raw size and power of their classical kin, they make up for it with increased cunning and versatility.

### Regenerate and Mutate
While trolls come in many forms with different traits and abilities from world to world, there are some common characteristics that most of them share.  The most iconic of which is their regenerative abilities.  The degree of healing factor varies between trolls, with the more monstrous trolls able to heal wounds and regrow limbs within seconds.  Other trolls have more modest regeneration abilities, which can wane if overtaxed. Nearly all troll regeneration can be halted by fire and acid, and trolls are naturally wary of such elements.

The regenerative abilities of trolls are thought to be responsible for their ability to rapidly mutate and adapt to new environments.  Trolls exposed to and damaged by magical emanations or other supernatural forces are prone to taking on aspects of those phenomena when they regenerate.  Likewise, clans of trolls living in a particular environment for long periods of time quickly take on physical features that adapt them to their home.

### Smaller More Adaptable Adventurers
Most trolls outsize the typical adventurer.  They rely on size, strength, and a rapid healing factor to overcome challenges.  Troll adventurers tend to be smaller than their classical kin.  Some may have simply been the runt of their family, standing a foot or two shorter than the typical troll with underdeveloped claws and regenerative abilities.  Others may be the results of extreme mutations of members of their own troll subspecies.  
Whatever the case, these troll adventurers have learned to offset their physical deficiencies with greater mental capabilities and specialized training or abilities.  They might train in the use of weapons and battle tactics, learn to channel potent magical powers, or gain the aid of gods and supernatural beings.  Their natural troll adaptability, combined with the unusual circumstances of their background, makes these adventurers unpredictable but invaluable allies.

### Primordial Civilizations
On some worlds, trolls aren't regulated to being savage monsters roaming dangerous wilds.  In these settings, trolls maintain their own primal civilization, which blends their savage nature with a collective order that creates a cohesive society.  These civilizations are generally very old and often maintain practices that more modern societies would consider barbaric.  But the savage aspects of troll society give them more profound insights into the natural world.  These societies produce masterful hunters, mystic leaders who call upon primordial spirits for aid, and menageries of trained primordial beasts ready to tear apart any who stand against their troll masters.

### Troll Names
While naming conventions can vary significantly from world to world, most trolls put little thought into the niceties of naming convention, and most troll cultures don't even bother with surnames.  Trolls who take up a surname usually have one which reflects their deeds, and it usually originates from a nickname given to them by others.
<Br>**Male Troll Names:** Thrag, Kazko, Grendal, Veckuzz, Zinjo 
<br>**Female Troll Names:** Vak, Kranki, Juljin, Vinji, Razzel

##### Giant Troll Adventurers

|  2  | An extreme magical phenomenon severely mutated you, granting you unusual powers but leaving you a freak, even by troll standards.   |
|  3  | You were orphaned at birth and adopted by one or more humanoids who have done their best to "civilize" you. |

> ##### Giants or Humanoids?
> In most D&D settings, trolls are considered giants for the purposes of their creature type.  At your DM's discretion, you can change the creature type of your troll character from humanoid to giant.  This will usually result in a slight boost to your character's power level, as abilities that specifically target humanoids are more common than ones that target giants.

## New Feat

### Enhanced Regeneration
*Prerequisite : Troll Race*<Br>
You've further developed your innate troll regeneration, making you even more difficult to kill.  You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain additional Troll Hit Die equal to your proficiency modifier.  These hit die are d6s and can be used to regain hit points over a short rest just like your normal hit die.
