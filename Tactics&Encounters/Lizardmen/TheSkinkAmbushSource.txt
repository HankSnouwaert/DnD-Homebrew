## The Skink Ambush <br> (Player Level: 5-6)
In this encounter, the players are traveling through a dense, ruin-strewn jungle when they find themselves ambushed by a patrol squad of skinks.

### Encounter Context
The only context needed for this encounter is that the players are traveling through a dangerous jungle. They may or may not know about the presence of the skinks before this encounter, and if they don’t, it can serve as a good introduction to how they fight.


### Lead Up
The players will enter from the lower left corner of the map, and their path will take them across the bridge. Have the skinks make Dexterity (Stealth) checks before the encounter to determine how well hidden they are. If they don’t beat the Passive Perception of the players, the players will notice something lying in wait in the bushes once they can see across the river. 

If the players are stealthily enough to not be detected by the skinks, the skinks won’t be aware of their presence until they step into a clearing or try to cross the bridge, at which point, the players can’t remain hidden.

Unless the skinks are attacked first, they will wait to strike until the players are partway across the bridge.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The lighting will depend on the time of day, though if it’s mid-day, much of the canopy away from the river will be dimly lit due to the heavy tree cover.
* **The Bridge.** The structure is made of wood and rope and dealing 20 damage to any section will snap it. It has vulnerability to fire damage.
* **Jungle Flora.** The lowe underbrush is used by the skinks for hiding. The trees they surround reach an average of 20 feet high and can be climbed using a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to get a better view of the area.
* **River.** The River ranges from 10 to 15 feet deep at its center and slowly flows from right to left.
* **Walls and Rubble.** All the walls are made of stone, and creatures without a climb speed can attempt to climb them by making a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Some sections have fallen apart, leaving stone rubble.


### Combat
The players will face 4 skink cohorts led by a skink chieftain. They will fight so long as they have the upper hand and are able to keep the players from overwhelming them. They will try to maintain this advantage by utilizing the terrain around them to make any approach difficult as they attempt to keep the players poisoned with javelins. Beyond this, they will fight using the general skink tactics detailed later in this document.

### Aftermath
The skinks will try to flee once the fight is no longer going their way. Any who escape will rally a larger lizardmen force to crush the players. 

If the players flee, the skinks may pursue them if they appear to have an overwhelming advantage. But it is more likely that they will rally a larger lizardmen forces before attempting to do so.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables the players can find from the skinks. If the players slay the chieftain and you wish to give them a bigger reward, you can have him drop a ceremonial bone mask worth 50 gp. 

The players can also recover the poisoned javelins, though they can each only apply poison to a creature once.

#### XP Award: 3,500xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the skinks can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** All the skinks were defeated, and none were able to alert other lizardmen in the area.
* **100% XP:** Most of the skinks were defeated, but one or two were able to escape and alert other lizardmen to the players’ presence.
* **50% XP:** The players slew the chieftain or all the cohorts but fled the remaining skinks.
* **10% XP:** The players fled with the chieftain and one or more cohorts still alive.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter (Level 3-4).** Remove the skink chieftain. Change the XP Award to 800 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 7-9).** Add the skink skirmishers. Increase the XP award to 5,000 XP.

### Skink Tactics

Skinks generally keep their distance from the enemies, using their superior land, climb, and swim speeds to stay out of melee range. They generally work to debuff foes, and combo well with more powerful creatures who attack head on.

#### Jungle Toxins
Skinks rely on this ability for their own defense, as poisoned players will have a harder time hitting them with attacks or spotting them while they’re hidden. As such, they will try to poison as many enemies as possible.

#### Mask of the Jungle
This ability is vital for skinks initiating combat as they will never start a fight without the backup of more powerful creatures unless they can do so from an ambush.

#### Skink Cohorts
These skinks have the fewest options for weaving in and out of combat, and so will rely on poisoning targets from a distance before engaging in melee. They will not close the gap with enemies who aren’t poisoned or in some way disabled.

\columnbreak

#### Skink Skirmisher
Because these skinks have blowguns and the ability to hide every turn using their vanish ability, they will never engage in melee combat unless cornered.

#### Skink Chieftain
These skinks lead their kind in battle. They have a few noteworthy abilities:

##### Coordinating Javelin
Chieftains will use this ability to help other skinks quickly land a second javelin strike against a chosen target, thereby increasing the likelihood of it failing its saving throw against the Jungle Toxins.
##### Stalking Cohort
This ability allows groups of skinks to focus fire poisoned targets. The skinks can pop out from hiding, launch volleys of ranges attacks, and then disappear again, quickly whittling down poisoned players.

\pagebreakNum

### Skink Loot
Because skinks are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skink Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
