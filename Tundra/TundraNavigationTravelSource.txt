# Tundra Travel
Tundras are among the most extreme and unforgiving environments for overland travel. They are usually sparsely inhabited, and what few paths they have are often subjected to deadly hazards. Their lack of resources and extreme cold force travelers to bring their own food and cold resistance shelters and clothing. Those who become lost in such environments are seldom heard from again, their resources quickly dwindling as they are left at the mercy of the murderous cold. 

Extreme winters can impose many of these same hazards in non-tundra environments. However, some hazards and peculiarities, such as glacial crevasses and round-the-clock nights, are only found in polar environments.

## Travel Activities
When the players travel long distances overland, tundra environments can be a significant challenge in their journey. You may modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players travel through such terrain.

### Travel Pace
If the players are traveling through deep snow or across icy terrain, it is considered rough terrain unless they have footwear that helps them cross such terrain (snow shoes, ice boots, skis, etc.) Most normal mounts and vehicles will also have trouble moving through snowy terrain, and the players may need to use vehicles such as dog sleds.

### Navigation
The difficulty in navigating tundra environments can vary greatly. The DMG suggests a navigation DC of around 10 for most arctic environments. However, expansive, featureless snowscapes would likely have a DC of 15. If most of the environment's land features are defined by snow banks, high winds and precipitation can cause major shifts in the landscape, distorting any prior familiarity the players have with an area.

Even if the players are following a normally navigable path that would normally negate the need for navigation, snow drifts could make such paths impassible, forcing them to find alternative routes.

Depending on the cosmology and day/night mechanics of your setting, the players may also experience days or nights that are of extreme length depending on the time of year. Long or perpetual days could allow them to travel in bright light for longer, or the polar night could make navigation and spotting hazards more difficult. 



### Foraging
Tundra environments tend to have little to no natural resources. In areas too cold to support forests, the foraging DC should be 20 or higher. In forested areas, it may be 15.


### Taking Shelter
While any environment can pose challenges to travelers looking to make shelter for the night, tundras are particularly unforgiving to the unprepared. Normal tents and bedrolls may be insufficient to ward off the effects of extreme weather and cold, thus preventing them from gaining the benefits of a long rest. The players may need special cold-weather camping equipment if they can't find a natural shelter from the elements.

## Tundra Hazards
Tundras are among the most hazardous natural environments. Extreme cold, strong wind, heavy precipitation, frigid waters, thin ice, and slippery ice are all common tundra hazards described in the DMG (pg. 110). Other hazards include hidden crevasses and frigid winds.  

### Hidden Crevasses
Snowy environments can hide crevasses and sudden drops. This is especially common if the players are traveling across glacial expanses. Such drops are functionally similar to hidden pit traps. To randomly determine their depth, you can make them 1d12*20ft. deep for the typical crevasse.

#### Spotting Crevasses
Rather than using passive Perception to spot hidden crevasses, you may opt to use the passive Survival of any characters keeping a lookout. The DC to spot the fall can be anywhere from 10 (barely hidden crevasses) to 30 (supernaturally hidden crevasses). You can pick what's appropriate for your environment or roll to determine one randomly.

#### Falling Through
If a creature doesn't spot the crevasse and falls through, it can make a Dexterity save to try to catch a ledge and prevent the fall. The DC of this save depends on the nature of the fall. A relatively narrow crevasse may only have a DC 10. A large crevasse that's 10s of feed wide with supernaturally slick ice ledges may have a DC 30. This save DC can be independent of the DC to spot the fall, and you can pick one you feel is appropriate to the situation or roll to determine it randomly.

If a creature fails to grab a ledge, it falls the full length of the crevasse. 

### Winds
Rules for strong winds are described on page 110 of the DMG. If you wish to make your winds particularly hazardous, you can modify them in the following ways; the save DCs and severity of the effects these winds have are determined by the Wind Severity table.

##### Extreme Cold
This wind carries a chill that cuts to the core. For every 1 minute a creature without cold resistance spends in the wind, it must make a Constitution save. On a failure, the creature takes an amount of cold damage dependent on the severity of the cold, and on a pass, it takes half as much damage. Creatures with insulating fur or clothing have advantage on this save.

##### Sudden Gusts
This wind will unexpectedly pick up gusts capable of bowling over creatures. At the start of every round of combat with this wind, roll 1d6. On a result of 5 or 6, all creatures not behind at least half cover are subjected to the effects of the *gust of wind* spell, except the distance they are moved on a failed save is dependent on the severity of the wind. 

If the players aren't in combat, this wind will greatly hamper travel for those not behind cover and make traveling near crevasses very dangerous. If players are traveling for an extended period of time through an open area subjected to sudden gusts, have each of them make a Strength save for each hour of travel. On a success, they are able to push through the winds, and on a failure, they treat the terrain areas as though it's rough terrain while they struggle to fight against the winds. If the terrain is already rough terrain, creatures can only move through it at 1/4th the speed. 

##### Wind Severity
|      Wind Severity      | Wind Save DC |  Cold Damage |  Gust Push Distance | 
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|           Mild         |         10      |        1d8          |         5ft.          | 
|           Moderate         |         15         |          2d8          |         5ft.          | 
|           Intense         |         20         |           4d8    |        10ft.          | 
|           Extreme         |         25          |        6d8          |         10ft.          |
|           Supernatural         |         30         |        8d8         |         15ft.          |
