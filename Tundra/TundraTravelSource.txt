# Tundra Travel
Tundras are among the most extreme and unforgiving environments for overland travel. They are usually sparsely inhabited, and what few paths they have are often subjected to deadly hazards. Their lack of resources and extreme cold force travelers to bring their own food and cold resistance shelters and clothing. Those who become lost in such environments are seldom heard from again, their resources quickly dwindling as they are left at the mercy of the murderous cold. 

Extreme winters can impose many of these same hazards in non-tundra environments. However, some hazards and peculiarities, such as glacial crevasses and round-the-clock nights, are only found in polar environments.

## Travel Activities
When the players travel long distances overland, tundra environments can be a significant challenge in their journey. You may modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players travel through such terrain.

### Travel Pace
If the players are traveling through deep snow or across icy terrain, it is considered rough terrain unless they have footwear that helps them cross such terrain (snow shoes, ice boots, skis, etc.) Most normal mounts and vehicles will also have trouble moving through snowy terrain, and the players may need to use vehicles such as dog sleds.

### Navigation
The difficulty in navigating tundra environments can vary greatly. The DMG suggests a navigation DC of around 10 for most arctic environments. However, expansive, featureless snowscapes would likely have a DC of 15. 

\columnbreak


<br><br><br><br><br>

If most of the environment's land features are defined by snow banks, high winds and precipitation can cause major shifts in the landscape, distorting any prior familiarity the players have with an area.

Even if the players are following a normally navigable path that would normally negate the need for navigation, snow drifts could make such paths impassible, forcing them to find alternative routes.

Depending on the cosmology and day/night mechanics of your setting, the players may also experience days or nights that are of extreme length depending on the time of year. Long or perpetual days could allow them to travel in bright light for longer, or the polar night could make navigation and spotting hazards more difficult. 



### Foraging
Tundra environments tend to have little to no natural resources. In areas too cold to support forests, the foraging DC should be 20 or higher. In forested areas, it may be 15.


### Taking Shelter
While any environment can pose challenges to travelers looking to make shelter for the night, tundras are particularly unforgiving to the unprepared. Normal tents and bedrolls may be insufficient to ward off the effects of extreme weather and cold, thus preventing them from gaining the benefits of a long rest. The players may need special cold-weather camping equipment if they can't find a natural shelter from the elements.

## Tundra Hazards
Tundras are among the most hazardous natural environments. Extreme cold, strong wind, heavy precipitation, frigid waters, thin ice, and slippery ice are all common tundra hazards described in the DMG (pg. 110). Other hazards include hidden crevasses and frigid winds.  

### Hidden Crevasses
Snowy environments can hide crevasses and sudden drops. This is especially common if the players are traveling across glacial expanses. Such drops are functionally similar to hidden pit traps. To randomly determine their depth, you can make them 1d12*20ft. deep for the typical crevasse.

#### Spotting Crevasses
Rather than using passive Perception to spot hidden crevasses, you may opt to use the passive Survival of any characters keeping a lookout. The DC to spot the fall can be anywhere from 10 (barely hidden crevasses) to 30 (supernaturally hidden crevasses). You can pick what's appropriate for your environment or roll to determine one randomly.

#### Falling Through
If a creature doesn't spot the crevasse and falls through, it can make a Dexterity save to try to catch a ledge and prevent the fall. The DC of this save depends on the nature of the fall. A relatively narrow crevasse may only have a DC 10. A large crevasse that's 10s of feed wide with supernaturally slick ice ledges may have a DC 30. This save DC can be independent of the DC to spot the fall, and you can pick one you feel is appropriate to the situation or roll to determine it randomly.

If a creature fails to grab a ledge, it falls the full length of the crevasse. 

### Winds
Rules for strong winds are described on page 110 of the DMG. If you wish to make your winds particularly hazardous, you can modify them in the following ways; the save DCs and severity of the effects these winds have are determined by the Wind Severity table.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

##### Extreme Cold
This wind carries a chill that cuts to the core. For every 1 minute a creature without cold resistance spends in the wind, it must make a Constitution save. On a failure, the creature takes an amount of cold damage dependent on the severity of the cold, and on a pass, it takes half as much damage. Creatures with insulating fur or clothing have advantage on this save.

##### Sudden Gusts
This wind will unexpectedly pick up gusts capable of bowling over creatures. At the start of every round of combat with this wind, roll 1d6. On a result of 5 or 6, all creatures not behind at least half cover are subjected to the effects of the *gust of wind* spell, except the distance they are moved on a failed save is dependent on the severity of the wind. 

If the players aren't in combat, this wind will greatly hamper travel for those not behind cover and make traveling near crevasses very dangerous. If players are traveling for an extended period of time through an open area subjected to sudden gusts, have each of them make a Strength save for each hour of travel. On a success, they are able to push through the winds, and on a failure, they treat the terrain areas as though it's rough terrain while they struggle to fight against the winds. If the terrain is already rough terrain, creatures can only move through it at 1/4th the speed. 

##### Wind Severity
|      Wind Severity      | Wind Save DC |  Cold Damage |  Gust Push Distance | 
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|           Mild         |         10      |        1d8          |         5ft.          |

## Example Random Encounter Tables
The following are different tundra environments across varying levels of gameplay, complete with random encounter tables you can use when the players are traversing them.  You can plug these right into your games, modify them to better suit your campaign, or simply use them as inspiration for creating and running your own river encounters.

Each tundra has a DC determining its foraging difficulty and an activity level suggesting how often to roll for a random encounter. There is also some information on the types of weather events likely to happen in these environments and what their DC range should be.

Not every encounter is meant to be a fight the players should be forced into. If the players are on the lower end of the level range, some of the encounters might be overwhelming for them, and they should have the option to attempt to avoid combat through other interactions, hiding, or fleeing. You can avoid encounters that seem like they wouldn't fit the current situation or modify them as needed.

Creatures on the tables with a single asterisk by their name can be found as free content on our website (www.StarsailGames.com) or Patreon (www.patreon.com/starsailgames). Creatures with two  asterisks can be found just after the table.

**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 4 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 15 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 15 <br>
**Weather DC:**  Save DCs for weather events range from 10-15.


The Ice Pine Tundra is a boreal region characterized by vast pine forests punctuated by open snow-covered hills. Recently, it has become a focal point for mystic turmoil as three renegade crone apprentices fled their mentors to test their powers. Seeking to bind fey creatures to their will, they summoned kallikantzaroi from the fey wild. However, these creatures have proven uncontrollable, wreaking havoc across the tundra. Their unchecked rampage has led to widespread deforestation, disrupting the ecosystem and driving native wildlife to exhibit erratic behavior. The once serene landscape now bears the scars of magical folly, with chaos reigning in the wake of the renegades' failed experiment.

### The Winter Cursed Vale <Br>(Level 5-10)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 3 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 10 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 10 <br>
**Weather:** Save DCs for weather events range from 15-20.

The Winter Cursed Vale was once a flourishing valley, teeming with life and home to a vibrant fiefdom. However, it has now fallen victim to a relentless curse, shrouding it in perpetual winter. This curse has not only frozen the landscape but has also awakened the dead, turning the valley into a haunting ground for roaming undead. Traveling in and out of the valley has become perilous, with the living inhabitants locked in a constant struggle for survival against the undead threats.

Adding to the chaos are hill giants from the surrounding areas, exploiting the valley's vulnerability by leading bands of ogres to pillage its remaining resources. The true origins of the curse and any potential involvement of the ruling nobility remain shrouded in mystery, adding to the sense of despair and danger that pervades the Winter Cursed Vale.

### The Far Glaciers (Level 11-16)
**Activity Level:** 1 Encounter per 6 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 25 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 25 <br>
**Weather:** Save DCs for weather events range from 20-25.

The Far Glaciers form a remote and frigid sea, encompassing a distant archipelago devoid of settlements and rarely visited. Harsh conditions make life scarce even for animals, rendering these islands inhospitable. While thick ice blankets much of the archipelago, scholars speculate that these lands were once inhabited by an ancient civilization. Sparse artifacts hint at this, although few who venture there return to corroborate theories.

Exploring the glaciers is perilous; the bone-chilling cold and glacial dangers claim many lives. Survivors speak of forgotten horrors entombed within the ice and arcane constructs powered by unknown technologies. Such accounts are dismissed as the ramblings of madness, attributed to the extreme isolation and conditions faced in these icy depths.

> ***Aberrant Ground.*** The ground in a 15-foot radius around the mouther is doughlike difficult terrain. Each creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or have its speed reduced to 0 until the start of its next turn.
>
> ***Gibbering.*** The mouther babbles incoherently while it can see any creature and isn’t incapacitated. Each creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the mouther and can hear the gibbering must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d8 to determine what it does during its turn. On a 1 to 4, the creature does nothing. On a 5 or 6, the creature takes no action or bonus action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if it can’t make such an attack.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The gibbering mouther makes a bite attack and, if it can, uses its Blinding Spittle.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 31 (7d8) piercing damage. If the target is large or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is killed by this damage, it is absorbed into the mouther.
>
> ***Blinding Spittle (Recharge 4–6).*** The mouther spits a chemical glob at a point it can see within 30 feet of it. The glob explodes in a blinding flash of light on impact. Each creature within 10 feet of the flash must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mouther’s next turn.

### The Demon Wastes (Level 17-20)
**Activity Rating:** 1 Encounter per 3 Hrs. of Travel <br>
**Foraging DC:** 25 <br>
**Navigation DC:** 30 (Magical Aid Reduces It To 20) <br>
**Weather:** Save DCs for weather events range from 25-30.

The Demon Wastes, situated in the far north, teeters on the edge of a planar convergence with a demonic realm, imbuing the region with dark energies. This influence has twisted the landscape, turning it into a nightmarish wasteland. The area is plagued by frequent demonic incursions, with warmongering demons rampaging through, leaving destruction in their wake.

Driven by their infernal devotion, demon-worshipping barbarian tribes flock to the Demon Wastes, seeking to prove themselves to their demonic overlords. However, the land itself rebels against this desecration, unleashing aggressive elementals and supernatural wildlife to fiercely defend its sanctity. Anyone who dares intrude on these cursed lands risks facing not only the wrath of demons but also the vengeful fury of the land itself.
