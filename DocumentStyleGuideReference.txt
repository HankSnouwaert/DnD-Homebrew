# Document Style Guide Reference

## General Writing

### Titles & Trademarks
See style guide.

### Headings
Follow heading sizes in order; do not skip sizes.  The only exceptions to this rule are the titles of spells and feats, which always use the same heading size.

#### Inline Subheads
This is the lowest level of heading (Heading 4) and has the following format:<br>
***Keen Senses.*** You have proficiency in the Perception skill.

### Spelling and Punctuation
#### Bulleted Lists
Use the following rules when making bulleted list: 
* Each item begins with a capital letter.
* Only use closing punctuation if the item is a complete sentence.
* Introduce the list with a complete list ending with a colon.

### Numbers and Math

#### Numerals versus Words (In Text)
* Spell out whole numbers from zero to one hundred, as well as numbers that are formed by adding “hundred,” “thousand,” or “hundred thousand” to one of those numbers.  
    * Percentages and units of measurement are exceptions to this rule


#### Fractions and Percentages
* Spell out simple fractions:
    * One-fourth
    * Two-thirds
* Spell out the word "percent" unless it is in a table
* Use "half" not "one-half"

### Cross-References
See style guide

### Planes of Existence
A character is on a plane of existence. For example, “He was trapped on the Plane of Fire.” But a character is in a plane when it is referred to by name without the word “plane.” For example, “She is in Elysium.”

## RPG Writing
### Formating Game Terms

#### Terms to Capitalize
* Ability scores {Strength, Intelligence}
* Action names {the Attack action, the Dash action}
* Armor Class
* Artifacts {*Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*}
* Class features {Sneak Attack, Rage}
* Difficulty Class
* Dungeon Master
* Feats {Loremaster}
* Languages {Common, Dwarvish, Elvish}
* Planes of existence {the Abyss, the Nine Hells, the Ethereal Plane, the Plane of Air}
* Skills {Arcana, Perception}
* Traits in races and monsters {Aquatic, Keen Senses}
 
#### Terms to Set in Bold
Stat block names in running text {three **hobgoblins**, one **drow mage**, two **fire elementals**}

By default, a bold stat block name refers to a stat block in the Monster Manual. If you’re referring to a stat block in your manuscript, instead of in the Monster Manual, use a parenthetical to make that fact clear. 

Here’s an example: “Four **air elemental myrmidons** (see chapter 7) lurk here.”

Make sure no text gets between the number of monsters appearing and the name of the stat block. For example, write “four **goblins**,” not “four loud **goblins**”; that adjective needs to go somewhere else in the sentence.
Set a monster’s name in bold only the first time it appears in an encounter area or other subsection.

#### Terms to Italicize
* Artifacts {*Axe of the Dwarvish Lords*}
* Magic items {*flame tongue*}
* Spells {*magic missile*}

### Numerals in Rules Text
Use numerals for "gamey" mechanics and tactical details and words for narrative details.  Examples can be found in the style guide.

### Verb Usage
* You cast a spell.
* You deal damage.
* You drop to 0 hit points.
* You finish a short or long rest.
* You gain temporary hit points.
* You make an ability check, and it succeeds or fails.
* You make a saving throw, and it succeeds or fails.
* You make an attack (or you attack), and your attack hits or misses (it doesn’t succeed or fail).
* You reduce a target to 0 hit points.
* You regain hit points.
* You restore hit points to a target.
* You score a critical hit.
* You take an action, or you use your action to do something.
* You take damage.
* You use a feature.

### Common Pitfalls
#### Making a Roll vs. Succeeding One
Don’t mistake making an ability check, a saving throw, or other roll with succeeding on it. The following sentence gets it right: “You must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check to clamber up the wall.” Don’t write, “You must make a DC 15 Strength check to clamber up the wall,” unless that sentence is immediately followed by a description of what happens on a success or failure.

#### Saving Throws
&ensp;&nbsp; ***Save.*** “Save” can be used as a synonym for “saving throw,” but use it sparingly, preferably only in a stat block or when preceded by “saving throw.”<br>

***Must Make. . .*** When a creature is subjected to an effect that requires a saving throw, we prefer “the target must make a saving throw . . .” over “the target makes a saving throw . . .”<br>

***Rolling a Saving Throw.*** Writing “roll a saving throw” is redundant, since a saving throw, by definition, involves a throw of a die. You make a saving throw.

#### Advantage and Disadvantage
You make a roll **with** advantage or disadvantage, or you have advantage or disadvantage on a roll.

Also, an **attack roll**, not an attack, has advantage or disadvantage.

#### “Result” and Die Rolls
When you need to refer to the number rolled on a die, do so idiomatically. Here are examples: “If you roll at least a 10, you succeed,” “You score a critical hit if you roll a 20,” and “Add the number you roll to any bonuses or penalties.”

“Result” can legitimately refer to the sum of a die roll and any modifiers. “Compare the result to the DC to determine whether you succeed,” for example. We often prefer the word “total” in such a context.

\columnbreak

#### “Magic” vs. “Magical”
We use “magic” as an adjective to describe an object that has magical qualities (a magic item, a magic sword, a magic trap).
The adjective can be used for other things, but we use “magical” more often than “magic” for them. And “magic item” and its variants should never be “magical item.”

#### Extra Damage
We write “an extra 1d4 fire damage,” not “1d4 extra fire damage.” We like to keep the die expression with the damage type.

#### Hit Point Maximum
When you write about a creature’s hit point maximum, avoid “maximum hit points.”

Writing in the singular allows for natural, precise wording, such as “If the target's hit point maximum is 25 or more . . .” or “If the target’s hit point maximum is less than 50 . . .”

#### Proficiency
Here are the rules of thumb for using the right preposition with the words “proficient” and “proficiency”:

* You are proficient, or have proficiency, in a skill, language, or other activity that is learnable and repeatable.
* You are proficient, or have proficiency, with a tool, weapon, type of armor, or other object.

#### “At Will” vs. “At-Will”
This compound is open. For example, “You can cast this spell at will.” The compound takes a hyphen only when it appears before a word that it modifies. For example, “That character has three at-will spells.”

## Example Content

#### Tool Proficiency
*3rd level Quantum Smith feature*<br>
You gain proficiency with your choice of smith's tools or alchemist's supplies.  If you already have these proficiencies, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tool of your choice.


#### Fireworks
*4th-level  evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of black powder)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard, Artificer
___

You launch up to three pyrotechnic bolts to three points within range.  They each explode, creating a 15-foot-radius sphere of light and sound that spreads out from their center point until the end of your next turn.  

The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an additional 30 feet.  Any creature in the sphere when it first appears must make a Constitution saving throw or become blinded and deafened until the end of your next turn.  If the creature is flying, it is also knocked prone.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the spell creates one more bolt for each slot above 4th.

#### Crystal Slippers
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This footwear is made from an enchanted crystalline material with a glassy finish.  When you take the disengage action while wearing both slippers, you may also dash as a bonus action.

You can retain your attunement to the slippers even if you lose one, but both slippers are required for the initial attunement. 

A creature holding the lost slipper knows your location as if they cast the *locate creature* spell on you.

### Somatic Master 
*Prerequisite : The ability to cast at least one spell*

You've learned to cast spells using only the power of your graceful gestures and dance-like maneuvers.  Doing so allows you to slip in and out of harm's way as you weave your magic.  You gain the following benefits:

* You can replace any spell's verbal, somatic, and material components with just a somatic component.  If the spell doesn't normally have a somatic component, it gains a somatic component when cast this way.

* Whenever you cast a spell with a somatic component, you can move 5 feet just before or just after you cast the spell.  This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

### Troll Traits
Despite the multitude of trolls across the multiverse, troll adventurers share a many common traits with each other.

***Ability Score Increase.*** Your Constitution score increases by 2. 

***Age.*** Trolls grow rapidly through childhood, reaching maturity around age 10.  Their healing factor allows them to live about a century before it ceases to sustain them. 

***Alignment.*** In most worlds, trolls are known for being chaotic evil, though exceptions exist, particularly among exiles living near other races.  Other worlds feature trolls with more varied alignments.

***Size.*** Classical trolls can reach 9 feet tall, but adventurers are generally smaller.  Your size range depends on which subrace you choose. 

***Speed.*** Your base walking speed is 30 feet. 

***Keen Smell.***  You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.

***Limited Regeneration.*** At the start or your turn, you can expend one of your hit die to regain hit points as if you finished a short rest. You cannot use this ability if you have taken fire or acid damage since the end of your last turn.<br>
You can use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier and regain all uses after you complete a long rest. 

***Environmental Adaptation.*** You've inherited natural adaptations suited to your home environment.  Choose an environment from the Environmental Adaptation table on the next page to gain the associated traits for that environment.

***Languages.*** You can speak, read, and write Common and Giant.

***Subraces.*** While there are many variations of trolls across the multiverse, for the purposes of a player character, these variations are divided into two groups: giant trolls, which are closer to the classical monster troll, and humanoid trolls, which are smaller and have more human characteristics. Choose one of them for your character.
