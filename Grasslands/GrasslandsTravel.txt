# Grasslands Travel
Grasslands can go by many other names depending on their region, from hot savannahs to windy prairies to the frigid steppe. Regardless of what they're called, they are all vast open plains covered with grass and, at most, sparse populations of trees that do little to impede movement or vision. These properties generally make grasslands easier to navigate and survive in than other environments. The greatest hazards tend to come from weather and other creatures inhabiting them, as their open, resource-rich nature makes it easy for them to harbor fearsome megafauna.

## Travel Activities
When players travel long distances overland, grasslands can be some of the most optimal environments to travel through. You may modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players travel through such terrain.

### Navigation
Grasslands are one of the easiest environments to navigate, and the DMG suggests using a navigation DC of 5. The fact that they provide good visibility while having regular landmarks such as hills and optional trees means players will usually be able to use points of reference to keep from getting lost.

\columnbreak



### Foraging 
The difficulty of foraging in grassland environments depends on how sparsely populated they are. Rivers and watering holes make for some of the best foraging, and the foraging DC can vary from 10 to 15 depending on the variety of flora and fauna in a given area.


### Tall Grass
Tall grass provides one of the few means of sneaking up on a creature in an open grassland. Outside of magical means or traveling at night, players generally won't have the option to move stealthily unless moving through tall grass. This works both ways, though, and moving through tall grass will also allow other creatures to attempt to sneak up on them.

### Flash Floods
Intro explanation
Noticing them
Determining their height
Minor: 1d4 feet
Average: 2d4 feet
Large: 2d6 feet
Extreme: Add d6s
When a creature enters the area of the flood, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes xd10 bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.

At the start of each turn, the leading edge of the flood, along with any creatures in it, moves Y feet downhill. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the flood or whose space the flood enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take Xd10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round. 

A creature caught in the flood can move by swimming. Because of the force of the water, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against the flood's save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can’t move.

### Sinkholes
Explain what sinkholes are
Explain how most how most of the time, the players will see them and be able to avoid them. However, they could make for good dungeon entrances and adventure locals.
However, if the players are unable to see a drop for any reason, or there is combat or some other dangerous event that risks pushing players off a drop, it may become necessary to determine its height. This is also true if something suddenly triggers the formation of the sinkhole under the player's feet. 

It may be convenient to break these drops up into general sizes. Roll for the depth and width separately.

**Small Holes:** These sinkholes range in the 10s of feet deep. You can make their diameter and depth **1d6x10ft.**

**Medium Falls:** These sinkholes range in the 100s of feet deep. You can make their diameter and depth **1d6x50ft.**

**Large Falls:** These sinkholes can reach up to 1000s of feet deep. You can make their diameter and depth **1d8x250ft**.

#### Spotting Sinkholes
Rather than using passive Perception to spot hidden sinkholes (or areas about to become sinkholes), you may opt to use the passive Survival of any characters keeping a lookout. The DC to spot the fall can be anywhere from 10 (barely hidden crevasses) to 30 (supernaturally hidden crevasses). You can pick what's appropriate for your environment or roll to determine one randomly.

#### Falling In
If a creature and falls through a sinkhole, it can make a Dexterity save to try to catch a ledge and prevent the fall. The DC of this save depends on the nature of the fall. If the players steps into a sinkhole, grabbing a ledge may be easy. If a large sinkhole forms under the players feet, or the ledges are crumbling, scrabbling to safety may be difficult, if not impossible.

This save DC can be independent of the DC to spot the fall, and you can pick one you feel is appropriate to the situation or roll to determine it randomly.

If a creature fails to grab a ledge, it falls the full length of the sinkhole.

### Winds
Rules for strong winds are described on page 110 of the DMG. If you wish to make your winds particularly hazardous, you can modify them in the following ways; the save DCs and severity of the effects these winds have are determined by the Wind Severity table.



##### Extreme Cold
This wind carries a chill that cuts to the core. For every 1 minute a creature without cold resistance spends in the wind, it must make a Constitution save. On a failure, the creature takes an amount of cold damage dependent on the severity of the cold, and on a pass, it takes half as much damage. Creatures with insulating fur or clothing have advantage on this save.

##### Sudden Gusts
This wind will unexpectedly pick up gusts capable of bowling over creatures. At the start of every round of combat with this wind, roll 1d6. On a result of 5 or 6, all creatures not behind at least half cover are subjected to the effects of the *gust of wind* spell, except the distance they are moved on a failed save is dependent on the severity of the wind. 

If the players aren't in combat, this wind will greatly hamper travel for those not behind cover and make traveling near crevasses very dangerous. If players are traveling for an extended period of time through an open area subjected to sudden gusts, have each of them make a Strength save for each hour of travel. On a success, they are able to push through the winds, and on a failure, they treat the terrain areas as though it's rough terrain while they struggle to fight against the winds. If the terrain is already rough terrain, creatures can only move through it at 1/4th the speed. 

##### Wind Severity
|      Wind Severity      | Wind Save DC |  Cold Damage |  Gust Push Distance | 
|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
|           Mild         |         10      |        1d8          |         5ft.          | 
|           Moderate         |         15         |          2d8          |         5ft.          | 
|           Intense         |         20         |           4d8    |        10ft.          | 
|           Extreme         |         25          |        6d8          |         10ft.          |
|           Supernatural         |         30         |        8d8         |         15ft.          |
