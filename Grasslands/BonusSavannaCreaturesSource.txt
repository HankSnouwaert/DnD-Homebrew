# Bonus Savanna Creatures
This document includes a collection of creatures that were created for our patrons as part of our savanna-themed encounters. We created these creatures with those encounters in mind, but they could be used in a variety of situations. So, we've compiled the creatures into a single document here for the convenience of anyone who wants quick access to them all in one place. We've also included some of our free creatures that can serve as useful steeds for the creatures that specialize in having specific kinds of mounts at their command. While these creatures were created with savannas in mind, they could be used in many types of environments.

## Mounted Ogre Warriors
Due to their immense girth, ogres generally aren't known to ride other creatures or be proficient cavalrymen. However, some ogres manage to subdue mighty beasts capable of carrying their massive frames and serving as formidable steeds in battle. 

Among the most common of these steeds are thundering war rhinos, which can impale and toss foes on command. Though attempting to subdue such beasts is usually a futile and deadly endeavor, those ogres who manage to break the rhino to their will have a deadly mount forever at their command. 

\columnbreak

The following stat blocks represent different types of ogres at different power levels who all specialize in riding steeds that can grapple foes. Though this is usually a rhino by default, you could mount any of these ogres on any such creature large enough to carry them. Rhino statblocks that can be used as mounts have also been included.

### Iron Fists 
Ogres are fond of gladiatorial pit-fighting, and many of the weapons and fighting tactics they've developed have been designed with this in mind. Among the most common is the iron fist. This item is essentially an orge-sized metal buckler that can be used to deflect incoming attacks and pummel foes.

#### New Item: Iron Fist
*Shield*
___
- **AC:** 1
- **Strength:** 15
- **Stealth:** -
- **Cost:** 10 gp
- **Weight:** 4 lb
___

***Iron Fist.***  If you meet the iron fist's Strength requirement, you may use both hands to wield a two-handed or versatile weapon with it equipped. However, you can't add your Dexterity modifier to attack and damage rolls with those weapons.

### Cungye

Cungye are vile reflections of unicorns and kirin. Whereas unicorns and kirin are elegant and graceful, nurturing life and healing wherever they tread, cungye are muscle-bound brutes covered in mangy patches of fur and gnarled growths running along their bodies. Each of their powerful, trunk-like limbs ends in twisted claws, which allow them to climb vertical surfaces with startling ease. Their most notable feature is the massive black ivory horn on their head. In stark contrast to the healing powers of their celestial counterparts, any creature pierced by a cungye's horn will have its life force siphoned away, invigorating the cungye with unholy ferocity. The horn can also unleash a terrible curse, reducing those subjected to it to nothing more than sickly husks.

\columnbreak

#### Hornless Cungye

 Through the casting of powerful spells or twisted surgery, a cungye's horn can be stolen. A cungye can live for 3 + 2d4 days without its horn before it dies and returns to the abyss as a demon with a Challenge Rating (CR) of 4 or less. While it is alive, it is a CR 7 creature, but it loses its gore attack, innate spellcasting, and its Tide of Languish ability. The <br> horn is a magical item worth 500 gp that can be forged <br> into a *sword of life stealing* by someone with proficiency <br> in smith's tools using at least 300 gp worth of smithing supplies.

> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d10 + 6) piercing damage. If the cungye moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 22 (4d10) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the cungye's horn, causing it to be grappled (escape DC 18). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of the cungye's turns. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the cungye gains temporary hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The cungye can't grapple other creatures with its Gore while it has a creature grappled this way.
>
> ***Tide of Languish (1/Day).*** The cungye chooses four creatures in a 30-foot cube within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or fall prone and become cursed for the next 10 minutes. While cursed, the creature can't stand up and its Strength and Dexterity scores are reduced to 1. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending the curse on a success.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The cungye's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). The cungye can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
>
> ***At will:*** *detect evil and good, protection from evil and good*
>
> ***1/day each:*** *dispel evil and good, dispel magic (5th level), locate creature*

## Pack Hunters

Many types of humanoids make sport of grand hunts with packs of hunting animals at their side. This is most common with humans riding down quarry with packs of hunting hounds leading the way. However, many other humanoids, such as elves and orcs, enjoy the thrill of such grand hunts. Those experienced in these hunts are able to effortlessly command the creatures hunting alongside them while staying back and shooting their quarry from afar.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Pack hunters are masters of setting up ambushes, setting their beasts loose when their prey least suspects it. As the hunting beasts harry and attack their prey, the pact hunter directs their efforts and whittles down the target with precise shots, ensuring a swift conclusion to their hunt. While most pack hunters pursue beasts and wild monsters, some have taken a more sinister turn and enjoy hunting other humanoids for perverse sport.

### Djinni Wind Hunters


Djinni Wind Hunters are aristocratic djinni known for their prowess in hunting across the elemental planes and the mortal world. These nobles of the air take great pride in their skill and agility, often pursuing rare and dangerous quarry for sport. They delight in the thrill of the chase, using their mastery of wind and weather to outmaneuver and capture their targets. Djinni Wind Hunters are not mere brutes; they are connoisseurs of the hunt, seeking not only to test their abilities but also to add extraordinary creatures to their grand menageries. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

These menageries, filled with exotic and often magical beasts, serve as both a status symbol and a testament to their hunting prowess. The Wind Hunters are also known to challenge worthy adventurers to hunts, offering valuable rewards for those who can keep pace with their legendary speed and cunning. However, those who become prey to the Wind Hunters find that escaping their relentless pursuit is no small feat, as the djinni can summon storms and ride the winds to track down even the most elusive of targets.

> ***Gale Longbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, range 150/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) thunder damage. If the target is Large or smaller, the djinni may push or pull it 10 feet away or towards itself.
> 
> ***Create Whirlwind.*** A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as a bonus action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni is more than 120 feet away from it. A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
> 
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:
> 
> At will: *detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave*
> 
> 3/day each: *create food and water, tongues, wind walk*
> 
> 1/day each: *creation, gaseous form, invisibility*
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> 
> ***Vapor Shift (3/day).*** The djinni or one willing creature it can see within 90 feet of it magically transforms into a vapor and moves up to 30 feet, and then reverts to its normal form. While in vapor form, the creature is under the effects of the *gaseous form* spell.

### Zephyr Fangs
The zephyr fang is a strange elemental beast resembling a cheetah, with sky-blue fur and white stripes running along its body. A ridge of silky, pearl-like hair extends from its back to its head, forming white fur plumes.

Zephyr fangs stalk the sky palaces and floating islands of the djinni, where they are favored pets of the air genies. It is said that the original zephyr fangs were cheetahs admired by the djinni for their speed and grace. Over generations, as these cheetahs lived in the Elemental Plane of Air, they became infused with its power. Now, it is common for djinni to have a coalition of zephyr fangs in their menageries. These creatures are splendid trophies for their djinni owners and are often taken along when the djinni seek to capture new slaves, much like nobles using cheetahs for hunting.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Zephyr fangs make their mundane kin appear lethargic by comparison. They can cross a mile within a minute, moving so fast that they become a blur to the eye, making it nearly impossible for foes to land an attack. They are also far more cunning than regular cheetahs, able to trip up prey skilled at disengaging from combat. Though primarily used to hunt on the Material Plane, zephyr fangs are well-adapted to their native environment of the Plane of Air. While they cannot fly, they can run across clouds as if they were solid ground and fall like feathers, preventing lethal drops.

Though zephyr fangs are mostly found in the service of djinni, there are many cases where their masters have been captured or killed, leaving the zephyr fangs on their own. These independent zephyr fangs often escape to the Material Plane, where most normal beasts stand little chance once a zephyr fang has honed in on them.

## Hyenas

Hyenas are cunning and adaptable predators found in grasslands, savannas, and arid regions. They are known for their powerful jaws, capable of crushing bone, and their eerie, cackling calls that echo across the plains. Though often associated with scavenging, hyenas are skilled hunters in their own right, capable of bringing down prey much larger than themselves through teamwork and persistence. They typically hunt in packs, coordinating their efforts to exhaust and overwhelm their targets. Once they close in on their prey, their relentless endurance and powerful bites make them a formidable threat to any creature caught in their path.

Hyenas are opportunistic and highly intelligent, able to adapt to changing conditions and exploit weaknesses in both prey and environment. This cunning extends to their interactions with humanoids, as hyenas are often drawn to settlements on the fringes of civilization, where they scavenge for food or prey upon livestock. Their boldness can lead to conflicts with villagers and farmers, who see them as dangerous pests that must be driven off or eliminated. However, in some cultures, hyenas are respected for their resilience and tenacity, and they are sometimes tamed and trained as guard animals or hunting companions. In darker aspects of some societies, hyenas are associated with death and the supernatural, believed to possess a connection to spirits or dark forces, leading to their use in rituals or as familiars by practitioners of dark magic.

### Cacklefiend Hyenas

Cacklefiend hyenas are twisted, fiendish versions of their mundane kin, corrupted by the dark influence of demonic forces. These malevolent beasts are larger, more ferocious, and far more cunning than ordinary hyenas. Their fur is matted and often singed, with eyes that glow with an unnatural, malevolent light. Their distinctive cackling, already eerie in normal hyenas, becomes a bone-chilling sound that echoes with the torment of the damned, capable of instilling fear and dread in even the bravest of hearts. This laughter is not just for show—it carries a corrupting influence that weakens the resolve of those who hear it, making them more susceptible to despair and darkness.

Cacklefiend hyenas are frequently found in the company of gnolls, particularly those who have pledged themselves to demon lords associated with hyenas and the wild savagery they represent. These fiendish creatures act as enforcers and hunters, driving gnoll warbands to greater acts of violence and brutality. Their presence often signals the impending rise of a demonic incursion, as cacklefiends serve as harbingers of the abyssal forces seeking to corrupt the mortal world. In battle, they exhibit terrifying ferocity, tearing through enemies with their powerful jaws and using their demonic strength to overpower even the most stalwart defenders.

## Howdahs & Howdah Creatures
War howdahs are small armored structures mounted to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use different types of howdahs in your games. They can be applied to howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own howdahs. 

Howdahs are generally structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger war beast of some kind. The creatures within the howdah are referred to as riders, and the creature the howdah is mounted upon is referred to as its steed. If one of the riders is controlling the steed, that creature is the pilot. Howdah riders and steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a howdah or its steed, the howdah and its steed are moved together.

* **Controlled & Independant Steeds.** The howdah's steed can be a controlled or independent mount as described in the player's handbook. If it is controlled, there must be a pilot who is controlling it.

* **Entering & Exiting Howdahs.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah. Any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. Each passenger already inside the howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.


### Howdah Saving Throws
While objects normally automatically fail all Strength, Dexterity, and Constituion saving throws, howdahs are active parts of combat, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, you can use the following rules when howdahs are subject to such saving throws.

#### Strength & Dexterity Saves
Howdahs equipped on an unencumbered steed do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as they can rely on their steed to make the save for them. If a howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, its steed must make the saving throw against the effect. If the steed succeeds on the save, the howdah passes the save.

\columnbreak


#### Constitution Saves
Howdahs can make their own Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is mounted on a steed.



### Opportunity Attacks
When the howdah steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the howdah itself. Passengers cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures outside the howdah.

### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures inside a howdah are considered within 5 feet of each other. Additionally, a creature inside a howdah does not gain disadvantage on ranged attacks due to a hostile creature being within 5 feet of it unless it is also in the howdah.

### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of three of the steed's largest hit dice.

### Teleporting
If the steed is teleported, the howdah and its riders can choose to teleport with it.

### Falling Howdahs
When a howdah's steed falls from a height of 10 feet or more, it and all its riders take fall damage as usual, and the riders fall prone.

### Repairing Howdahs
If a howdah has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting repairs, provided it has the necessary tools and parts. After 1 hour of work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus if proficient with the required tools. On success, the howdah regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. On failure, the howdah doesn't regain any hit points, but repairs can be reattempted with the same tools and parts.

### Howdah Destruction
When a howdah is destroyed, riders that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of its steed.

\pagebreakNum

## Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, howdahs have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Howdah DC 
Whenever the howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, that creature uses this value for the DC.

### Damage Threshold
Most howdahs possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the howdah takes the damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the howdah's hit points.

###  Steed Size
This is the minimum size a creature must be to be the howdah's steed. If a creature ever becomes too small to carry the howdah, the howdah falls off the creature and is knocked over as though its steed was knocked prone, described in the Prone Howdahs section.

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride in the howdah comfortably. Additional creatures may be able to fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the howdah at the DM's discretion.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the howdah adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning howdah, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the howdah is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits the howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

### Siege Weapons
A howdah may have one or more built-in siege weapons. These siege weapons are built into the howdah and share its Hit Points, AC, and Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the howdah is destroyed. These siege weapons can only be operated by riders in the howdah, and riders can't provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the howdah while operating these weapons. The weapons can't be used if the howdah is not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.
