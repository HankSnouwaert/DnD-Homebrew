# Grasslands Compendium

Grasslands are vast open fields that stretch out for miles on end with few natural barriers. They can range from hot savannas to windswept prairies to harsh steppe lands. Though they are generally easy to traverse, they offer little protection from hazardous weather or the dangerous creatures that often roam their expanse. The open nature of grasslands allows them to be the backdrop for any number of adventures in which there are few environmental features to hinder (or help) the players in their goals. They also make an ideal setting for battles between large armies or against colossal foes. 

\columnbreak

This document provides content to help you run games that feature grasslands of various types, from small fields to vast, continent-spanning plains. This content ranges from character options for players who want their characters to be associated with the open wilderness of the grasslands to mechanics for running sessions with travel through grasslands to a bestiary of grassland creatures to populate the open regions of your games. Whether the players are only spending a day traveling through across these regions or your entire campaign takes place on vast open plains, any of the content here can be used to enhance your games.

## Grassland Adventure Ideas

Grassland environments make for flexible adventure locales. The following adventure hooks can be used as inspiration for creating your own adventures out on the open plains. They could either be minor side quests or part of much larger campaign-spanning adventures.

##### Grassland Adventure Hooks

| d8  | Setup |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Stampede:** A massive herd of wild beasts is stampeding across the grasslands, threatening to trample everything in its path. The adventurers must find the cause of the stampede and stop it before it reaches a nearby settlement. |
|  2  | **The Steppe Raiders:** A nomadic tribe of raiders has begun attacking caravans and settlements along the steppe trade routes. The adventurers are hired to protect a valuable caravan and fend off lightning strikes from the mounted marauders.|
|  3  | **Ghosts on the Prairie:** A once-peaceful prairie is now haunted by spectral ranchers that appear at dusk, attacking travelers and disappearing at dawn. The adventurers are hired to investigate the origin of these ghost riders and put them to rest.   |

|   |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  4  | **Elemental Storms:** Sudden and powerful storms sweep across the grasslands, leaving unnatural devastation in its wake. The adventurers are tasked with evacuating settlers and determining the source of these storms. |
|  5  | **Shadow of The Giants:** Towering, territorial giants have begun roaming the plains, driving away animals and destroying crops. The adventurers are hired to stop the giants, but upon investigating, they learn that the giants are fleeing an even greater danger lurking at the heart of the grasslands. |
|  6  | **The Lost Caravan:** A wealthy merchant's caravan carrying dangerous artifacts has gone missing while crossing the grasslands. The adventurers are tasked with finding the missing goods and survivors.  |
|  7  | **Echoes of War:** Each year, on the anniversary of a major battle, spectral soldiers clash again across the plains where they fell. These echoes grow stronger every year, threatening to become real. The adventurers must find a way to break the cycle before it spills into the material world. |
|  8  | **The Beast Kings:** Legendary creatures known as the Beast Kings—giant, mythical versions of common animals like lions, eagles, and rhinos—are said to roam a wild savanna, each holding dominion over a vast territory. The adventurers are sent on a quest to find one of these Beast Kings, either to seek its aid or to defeat it for a powerful magical reward. |

## Druid Circle

### Circle of Grasslands
Like the creatures of the world, druids often adapt to a specific environment they consider to be their home.  Druids of this circle live in open planes and grasslands, running free amongst the creatures there.  These druids defend their open homes from poachers and others that would sully the open freedom of the planes with the cage of civilization.  

These druids specialize in adapting animals forms suited to charging across large open areas.  When given a sufficient runway, these druids become high speed battering rams capable of sending their foes flying of their feet.


#### Grasslands Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
Your mystical connection to grasslands infuses you with the ability to cast some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Grasslands Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 

##### Circle of Grasslands Spells 
| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *expeditious retreat*, *longstrider* |
|  3rd          | *incantation of protection*, *incantation of zeal* |
|  5th          | *crusader's mantle*, *haste*     | 
|  7th          | *aura of life*, *freedom of movement*      |
|  9th          | *circle of power*, *destructive wave*    |

#### Grassland Forms
*2nd Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
You can now use your Wild Shape feature to transform into unique grassland animal forms granted by this subclass, and when using your Wild Shape this way, you may use it as a bonus action. Detailed descriptions of these forms can be found in the Grasslands Wild Shapes section.

When shapeshifting into these forms, you can choose to either be Small or Medium. Starting at 10th level, you can also choose to be Large. 

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Grasslands Spells list and ignore their material component requirements.

You start knowing three of these forms: Antelope, Cheetah, Horse. Additional wild shape forms from this subclass become available at levels 4 and 8. 

##### Grasslands Wild Shape Options
| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Antelope, Cheetah, Horse |
|  4th          | Cape Buffalo, Giraffe, Lion       | 
|  8th          | Elephant, Rhino   |

#### Planes Runner
*2nd Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
Your speed increases by 10 feet while <br> you aren't wearing heavy armor or <br> wielding a shield.

Additionally, you gain an advantage on <br> Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) <br> checks relating to grasslands environments <br> and the life that inhabits them. You can also <br> speak with animals who dwell in grasslands <br> environments as though under the effects of <br> the *speak with animals* spell, and you have <br> advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) <br> checks made while interacting with them.


#### Sonic Charge
*6th Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
You gain the ability to charge at supersonic <br> speeds, smashing through anything standing in  <br> your way. As a bonus action, you may choose to <br> move up to 60 feet in a straight line along the <br> ground.

During this movement, you can move through <br> the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke <br> opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a <br> creature’s space, you are pushed into the nearest <br> unoccupied space.

Each creature whose space you move through must <br> make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save <br> DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 thunder <br> damage; on a successful save, it takes half as much <br> damage.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again <br> until you complete a long rest or expend a spell slot of <br> 3rd level or higher.




#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Avatar of the Planes
*10th Level Circle of Tundra feature* <br>
When you use your Wild Shape feature to transform into one of the forms granted by this subclass, you can choose one of the following enhancements while in that form:

* **Critical Velocity.** You can hurl yourself at your enemies with high speed, impacting them for lethal damage. When you hit a target with a weapon attack, the lowest number you must roll on the d20 for it to be a critical hit is reduced by 1 for every 10 feet you move straight toward the target before the attack this turn. This cannot reduce the critical hit range below 16.
* **Crushing Impact.** Your hits are so forceful that creatures have trouble recovering. When you knock a creature prone using a shove or any of your Wild Shape abilities, it cannot stand up until the start of your next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so.

* **Elusive Movement.** You are as mercurial as the wind. Attacks of opportunity made against you have disadvantage. You also have resistance to damage from opportunity attacks, and they cannot grapple you on a hit.

#### Instincts of the Planes
*14th Level Circle of Tundra feature* <br>
You've honed your instincts to be alert to any danger. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Strength or Constitution saving throws (your choice). Additionally, you may add your Wisdom modifier to initiative rolls.

# Grasslands Travel
Grasslands can go by many other names depending on their region, from hot savannas to windy prairies to the frigid steppe. Regardless of what they're called, they are all vast open plains covered with grass and, at most, sparse populations of trees that do little to impede movement or vision. These properties generally make grasslands easier to navigate and survive in than other environments. The greatest hazards tend to come from weather and other creatures inhabiting them, as their open, resource-rich nature makes it easy for them to harbor fearsome megafauna.

## Travel Activities
When players travel long distances overland, grasslands can be some of the most optimal environments to travel through. You may modify the overland travel activities detailed in the *Player's Handbook* in the following ways when the players travel through such terrain.


\columnbreak


### Navigation
Grasslands are one of the easiest environments to navigate, and the DMG suggests using a navigation DC of 5. The fact that they provide good visibility while having regular landmarks such as hills and optional trees means players will usually be able to use points of reference to avoid getting lost.

### Foraging 
The difficulty of foraging in grassland environments depends on how sparsely populated they are. Rivers and watering holes make for some of the best foraging, and the foraging DC can vary from 10 to 15 depending on the variety of flora and fauna in a given area.


### Tall Grass
Tall grass provides one of the few means of sneaking up on a creature in an open grassland. Outside of magical means or traveling at night, players generally won't have the option to move stealthily unless moving through tall grass. This works both ways, though, and moving through tall grass will also allow other creatures to attempt to sneak up on them.

## Grasslands Hazards
Extreme cold or heat, strong wind, heavy precipitation, quicksand, and razorvine are all common tundra hazards described in the DMG (pg. 110). Other hazards include wildfires, flash floods, sinkholes, and even tornadoes.  


### Flash Floods
Flash floods are sudden, rapid flooding events caused by intense rainfall, dam breaks, or other sudden water releases. They can occur with little warning and have devastating effects on both the landscape and any creatures caught in their path.

#### Noticing Floods
Players can generally notice the onset of a flash flood when it's 3d6 x 10 ft. away. The DC to spot the flood starts at 12 and decreases by 1 for every 10 ft. closer they get.

#### Getting Caught in a Flood
Being caught in a flash flood can be extremely dangerous, presenting multiple hazards to creatures in the area.

##### Initial Impact
When a creature enters the area of the flood, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes the flood's full amount of bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

\columnbreak

##### Movement and Further Impact
At the start of each turn, the leading edge of the flood, along with any creatures in it, moves 50 feet downhill. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the flood when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving throw or take half the flood's bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once per round.

##### Swimming in the Flood
A creature caught in the flood can move by swimming. Because of the force of the water, though, the creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against the flood's save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can’t move.

##### Flood Severity Table
Use the table below to determine the severity of the flood, the saving throw DC, and the bludgeoning damage:

| d6 | Flood Size | Flood Depth (ft.) | Flood Save DC | Flood Damage |
|:--:|:---------:|:-----------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| 1  | Minor     | 1d4               | 10            | 2             |
| 2  | Small     | 2d4               | 12            | 2d4           |
| 3  | Moderate  | 2d6               | 15            | 2d6           |
| 4  | Large     | 4d6               | 17            | 4d6           |
| 5  | Massive   | 4d10              | 20            | 4d10          |
| 6  | Extreme   | 5d12              | 25            | 5d12          |

> ##### But I'm Taller Than The Flood!
> For tall creatures in small floods, it may be easier to resist the being swept away. You can use the following rule of thumb for these situations (assuming the creature isn't prone): 
> 
> If a creature is at least twice as tall as the flood's depth, it has advantage on saves against the flood, and if the creature is at least four times as tall as the flood's depth, it automatically passes saves against the flood.

### Sinkholes
Sinkholes are sudden depressions or holes in the ground caused by the collapse of a surface layer. They can form naturally due to erosion or human activities such as mining. Sinkholes can present significant hazards, but they can also serve as intriguing dungeon entrances and adventure locations.

#### Noticing Sinkholes
Most of the time, players will see sinkholes and be able to avoid them. However, they can make for good dungeon entrances and adventure locales. If a sinkhole is hidden, rather than using passive Perception to spot hidden sinkholes (or areas about to become sinkholes), you may opt to use the passive Survival of any characters keeping a lookout. The DC to spot the fall can range from 10 (barely hidden crevasses) to 30 (supernaturally hidden crevasses). Choose what's appropriate for your environment or roll to determine one randomly.

Sometimes, something may suddenly trigger the formation of a sinkhole under the player's feet, making spotting it in time more difficult.

\columnbreak

#### Sinkhole Sizes
It may be convenient to break these drops up into general sizes. Roll for the depth and width separately.

**Small Holes:** These sinkholes range in the tens of feet deep. You can make their diameter and depth **1d6 x 10 ft.**.

**Medium Falls:** These sinkholes range in the hundreds of feet deep. You can make their diameter and depth **1d6 x 50 ft.**.

**Large Falls:** These sinkholes can reach up to thousands of feet deep. You can make their diameter and depth **1d8 x 250 ft.**.

#### Falling In
If a creature falls through a sinkhole, it can make a Dexterity saving throw to try to catch a ledge and prevent the fall. The DC of this save depends on the nature of the fall. If the player steps into a sinkhole, grabbing a ledge may be easy. If a large sinkhole forms under the player's feet or the ledges are crumbling, scrambling to safety may be difficult, if not impossible.

This save DC can be independent of the DC to spot the fall, and you can choose one you feel is appropriate to the situation or roll to determine it randomly.

If a creature fails to grab a ledge, it falls the full length of the sinkhole.

### Tornadoes

Tornadoes are violent windstorms characterized by a twisting, funnel-shaped cloud. They can cause severe damage to the environment and present significant dangers to any creatures caught in their path. Tornadoes can form quickly and are often unpredictable in their movement and intensity.

#### Spotting Tornadoes
Spotting tornadoes can be challenging due to various factors, including weather conditions and visibility. DMs will need to make their own judgment call on the DC to spot tornadoes. Those with proficiency in Nature may have advantage on checks to spot them.

#### Size
Tornadoes vary wildly in size and shape. Their height will always stretch up into clouds, but if you want to randomly determine a tornado's diameter, you can use the following table:

##### Tornado Diameter

| 1d20 | Diameter (ft.)  |
|:---:|:--------------------:|
| 1-2  | 3d6                |
| 3-5  | 3d6 x 5            |
| 6-8  | 3d6 x 10           |
| 9-13   | 3d6 x 50           |
| 14-17   | 3d6 x 100          |
| 18-19| 3d6 x 500          |
| 20    | 3d6 x 1000         |

\columnbreak

#### Land Speed
Tornadoes can have erratic speeds. If you want to randomize the speed, you can roll for it every round.

##### Tornado Land Speed

| 1d20 | Speed (ft.)   |
|:---:|:--------------------:|
| 1-3  | Same As Current     |
| 4-6  | Increase One Level  |
| 7-9  | Decrease One Level  |
| 10   | 0                   |
| 11   | 1d6 x 10            |
| 12   | 2d6 x 10            |
| 13-15| 4d6 x 10            |
| 16-18| 8d6 x 10            |
| 19   | 8d10 x 10           |

#### Severity
Much of the danger posed by a tornado will depend on its wind speed, which determines its severity. The following table can help you determine its characteristics based on its severity.

##### Tornado Severity 
| d6 (Severity Level)  | Wind Severity  | Save DC | Debris Damage | Time In Tornado (Rounds) | Throw Distance (ft.) |
|:--:|:---------------:|:-------:|:-------------:|:------------------------:|:--------------------:|
|  1  | Gale           | 10      | 1d10          | 0                        | 1d10 x 5             |

|  5  | Devastating    | 30      | 8d10          | 1d12                     | 1d10 x 500           |

#### Effects Near a Tornado
The area near a tornado is extremely dangerous due to high winds and flying debris. This danger zone around the tornado can vary depending on its size and severity. 

**Determining Danger Zone Size.** The following formula is a good guideline for determining how many feet the danger zone should stretch out from the tornado: 

Danger Zone Distance = 1/2 Tornado Diameter x Severity Level. 

**High Winds.** Use the rules for high winds described in the DMG for a guideline on how to handle their effect in the danger zone. 

##### Flying Debris
While in the danger zone, players are in danger of getting hit by flying debris. To randomly determine if a piece of debris is flying at a creature, roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns. If the result is less than or equal to the Wind Severity level, the player must succeed on a Dexterity save against the tornado's save DC or take bludgeoning damage equal to the tornado's debris damage. You can increase or decrease the size of the die used to account for tornadoes with more or less debris flying about.

\columnbreak

#### Getting Caught in a Tornado
Though tornadoes can't pull creatures into their vortex, any creature that is blown into the funnel is likely to suffer catastrophic effects.

##### Initial Contact
A creature that comes in contact with a tornado must make a Strength save against the tornado's save DC, with the following potential outcomes:
* **Pass By 5 Or More:** No effect.
* **Pass By Less Than 5:** The creature is pushed by half the tornado's throw distance.
* **Fail By Less Than 5:** The creature is thrown the tornado's throw distance.
* **Fail By 5 Or More:** The creature gets picked up by the tornado. (Tornadoes with a Severity Level of 1 can't pick up creatures)

##### Being Picked Up by a Tornado
Once a creature is picked up by a tornado, it remains carried by the wind for a number of rounds determined by the tornado's severity. The creature must make a Dexterity save every turn to avoid debris, as described in the Flying Debris section. After the time in the tornado has expired, the creature is thrown the tornado's Throw Distance from a height of 1d6 x 100 ft. per round spent in the tornado.

### Wildfires

Wildfires, or wildfires, are uncontrolled fires that spread rapidly through vegetation. They can start due to natural causes like lightning or human activities such as unattended campfires. Embers carried on the wind can start new fires ahead of the main fire, leading to unpredictable spreading patterns.

#### Wildfire Sizes
- **Minor:** Less than a square mile
- **Local:** Several square miles
- **Regional:** Dozens of square miles
- **Continental:** Hundreds of square miles

#### Duration of Wildfires
The duration of a wildfire can vary greatly depending on several factors, including weather conditions, available fuel, and firefighting efforts. Minor fires may burn out within a few hours to a day, while larger fires can last for weeks or even months.

#### Noticing the Fire's Edge
Players can generally notice the edge of the forest fire when it's 2d6 x 100 ft. away. The DC to spot the fire starts at 12 and decreases by 1 for every 50 ft. closer they get.

\columnbreak

#### Wildfire Speeds
The speed of a wildfire depends on wind conditions and terrain. Use the table below to determine the fire's movement rate in feet per round:

| Wildfire Speed in Feet | Wind Factor    |
|:----:|:--------------------:|
| 5 ft. | Moving Against Strong Wind   |
| 1d4 x 5 ft. | Moving Against Light Wind  | 
|  2d4 x 5 ft.  | No Wind           |
|  3d6 x 5 ft.  | Moving With Light Wind   |
|  6d6 x 5 ft.  | Moving With Strong Wind  |



##### Hill Speed Multiplier
The slope of the terrain affects the speed of the wildfire. Fires move faster uphill due to the rising heat preheating the vegetation ahead of the fire, making it easier to ignite. Conversely, fires move slower downhill as the flames have less access to preheated fuel.

| Slope    | Speed Multiplier |
|:------:|:------:|
| Downhill | 0.5     |
| Flat     | 1       |
| Uphill   | 2       |

#### Getting Caught in a Wildfire
Being caught in a wildfire can be extremely dangerous, presenting multiple hazards to creatures in the area.

##### Contact With Fire
Direct contact with the fire can cause severe burns and ignite creatures. Creatures that come in direct contact with the fire must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to the fire's base DC + 5). On a failed save, the creature takes the full fire damage of the wildfire and catches fire. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and doesn't catch fire. A creature that's caught fire takes the full fire damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature can use an action to put out a creature that's caught on fire.

##### Ambient Heat Damage
The intense heat in the vicinity of the fire can cause exhaustion and burns over time. Every minute spent in the area of the forest fire, a creature must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to the fire's base DC + 1 per previous check). On a failed save, the creature takes fire damage and suffers a level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and doesn't suffer a level of exhaustion. Creatures that aren't breathing in the burning air have advantage on this save.



##### Smoke
Thick smoke from the fire can obscure vision and cause respiratory issues. Areas of smoke created by the wildfire are lightly obscured. At the end of every round spent in this smoke, a creature breathing in the air must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to the fire's base DC + 1 per previous check). On a failed save, the creature becomes incapacitated as it begins coughing and wheezing. If a creature fails this save twice in a row, it suffers a level of exhaustion.

##### Wildfire Severity Table
Use the table below to determine the severity of the wildfire, the saving throw DC, and the fire damage:

| d10 | Fire Severity  | Wildfire Save DC | Fire Damage |
|:--:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|
| 1-2 | Mild               | 7                     | 1d8                  |
| 3-4 | Moderate           | 12                    | 2d8                  |
| 5-6 | Intense            | 17                    | 4d8                  |
| 7-8 | Extreme            | 19                    | 6d8                  |
| 9-10 | Supernatural      | 24                    | 8d8                  |

### Brown Bears
Brown bears are the stalwarts of the wilderness, with a range of fur colors that blend into the varied landscapes they inhabit. These large and powerful animals are found in numerous regions, each home to distinct subspecies with their own unique adaptations. Their diet is as broad as their habitat, consisting of fruits, nuts, fish, and small mammals, showcasing their omnivorous nature. 

While brown bears typically lead solitary lives, they may gather in numbers in areas of abundant food like a rich salmon run. They have a complex social structure that becomes apparent during these gatherings, where hierarchies are observed and occasionally contested. Despite their solitary nature, mothers are fiercely protective of their cubs, teaching them essential survival skills.

As winter approaches, brown bears enter a phase of intense eating known as hyperphagia to prepare for hibernation, significantly increasing their food intake to build fat reserves. This crucial period heightens their aggression as the drive to feed becomes paramount. Bears are more likely to encounter others during this time, defending their food sources fiercely. The necessity to fatten up can make them more dangerous, as they prioritize feeding over avoiding conflict, posing increased risks to themselves and others.

#### Grizzly Bears
The large and ferocious subspecies known as grizzly bears have captured the awe of those who share or venture into their territories. Their more aggressive nature is often a result of the fierce competition for resources and the need to defend their space. They are slightly larger than most other brown bears and have a distinct hump on their shoulders, a feature that highlights their powerful forelimbs and their ability to dig and forage. Grizzlies are particularly known for their impressive physical capabilities and can often be more aggressive and dangerous, especially when surprised or when they are with their cubs. Some grizzlies become brazen hunters, willing to attack humanoids without provocation. This has made them among the most feared animals by those traveling through remote wilds.

### Arctotheriums

Arctotherium, the ancient primeval bear known as the short-faced bear, stands as a towering figure in the annals of natural history. These bears are characterized by their expansive chests and shortened snouts, a distinct feature from which they derive their name. Despite their formidable size, they are agile, capable of covering ground swiftly, a trait that serves them well in their pursuit of prey and sustenance.

These primeval creatures are omnivorous, with a preference for large meals to support their massive builds. Their diets are adaptable, consisting of anything the land offers, from vegetation to larger game. Arctotherium's powerful forelimbs and strong jaws are their primary tools, enabling them to hunt effectively and scavenge from others when the opportunity arises.

Arctotherium are typically solitary, with each bear maintaining a large territory that overlaps with others only occasionally. These territories are the stages upon which they silently enact their daily rituals of foraging, hunting, and roaming. Interaction between these ancient bears is rare, limited to necessary engagements such as mating or competing for resources.

Though often spoken of as relics of a bygone era, arctotheriums are still rumored to roam the remote and wild recesses of the world. They may be found deep in primeval forests, guarding ancient shrines dedicated to ursine gods, or in the service of powerful druids. Adventurers who stumble upon such beasts do well not to anger them, for the arctotheriums's power and ferocity is far beyond that of any other bear they will have faced.

## Cheetahs
Cheetahs are sleek, agile predators that thrive in open grasslands, savannas, and lightly wooded areas. Renowned for their incredible speed, they are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching up to 70 miles per hour in short bursts. Their slender bodies, long legs, and flexible spines enable these remarkable feats, allowing them to swiftly overtake prey such as antelope and hares. Their claws, which are semi-retractable, provide additional grip during their high-speed chases, while their keen eyesight allows them to spot potential prey from a distance.

Cheetahs are typically solitary or found in small family groups. They rely on stealth and camouflage to approach their prey closely before initiating a chase. Once within range, they accelerate rapidly, closing the distance in seconds. The hunt usually concludes with a suffocating bite to the throat of the prey, a method that is both quick and efficient. Despite their hunting prowess, cheetahs are relatively lightweight compared to other large predators, making them vulnerable to larger carnivores and scavengers.

Some cultures have mastered the art of training these magnificent creatures for hunting, using their unparalleled speed and agility to pursue game. The sight of a trained cheetah in action is both thrilling and awe-inspiring. Wealthy individuals and nobility might keep cheetahs as exotic companions, showcasing their elegance and power. Additionally, cheetah pelts are highly valued for their distinctive spotted patterns, often crafted into garments or accessories believed to bestow grace and swiftness upon the wearer.

While not typically a threat to humanoids unless provoked or threatened, a cheetah's ability to strike with lightning speed makes it a formidable adversary if confronted. Some hunters seek out cheetahs for their prized pelts, though this often leads to conflicts with those who revere the animals as symbols of agility and hunting prowess. Whether admired for their beauty or respected for their hunting skills, cheetahs occupy a unique and revered place in the natural world, embodying both elegance and lethal efficiency.

***Giant Cheetahs.*** Giant cheetahs, much larger than their common relatives, roam grasslands and open plains as apex predators. Standing nearly twice as tall as regular cheetahs, they have sleek, muscular builds that enable remarkable speeds. Their powerful legs and semi-retractable claws provide traction, allowing them to hunt larger prey like deer and wild cattle with agility. Using stealth and speed, they quickly close in on their targets, ensuring a swift kill with sharp claws and powerful jaws. Despite their size, they retain keen eyesight and acute senses, detecting threats and opportunities from afar.

Humanoids are drawn to giant cheetahs for their hunting prowess and imposing presence. Some cultures revere them as symbols of strength, incorporating them into myths and traditions. Skilled tamers and hunters capture and train these cheetahs for grand hunts or as war beasts. Their distinctive, spotted pelts are highly prized for garments symbolizing power. Encounters with giant cheetahs are rare and dangerous, as their size and strength make them formidable. While they avoid humanoids unless provoked, confrontations require caution and respect. The allure of capturing or slaying one for its valuable pelt or prestige drives adventurers to seek them out, leading to perilous pursuits across wild landscapes.

### Cheetah Tactics
Cheetahs generally target extremely fragile prey, such as gazelles, unless they are hunting with other cheetahs. However, when working with a group of humanoid hunters, the primary role of the cheetah is to prevent the prey from escaping, allowing the other members of the hunting party to catch it.

##### Cheetah Adventure Hooks

### Cheetah Loot
The valuable items looted from cheetahs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cheetah. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Cheetah Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Zephyr Fangs
The zephyr fang is a strange elemental beast resembling a cheetah, with sky-blue fur and white stripes running along its body. A ridge of silky, pearl-like hair extends from its back to its head, forming white fur plumes.

Zephyr fangs stalk the sky palaces and floating islands of the djinni, where they are favored pets of the air genies. It is said that the original zephyr fangs were cheetahs admired by the djinni for their speed and grace. Over generations, as these cheetahs lived in the Elemental Plane of Air, they became infused with its power. Now, it is common for djinni to have a coalition of zephyr fangs in their menageries. These creatures are splendid trophies for their djinni owners and are often taken along when the djinni seek to capture new slaves, much like nobles using cheetahs for hunting.

Zephyr fangs make their mundane kin appear lethargic by comparison. They can cross a mile within a minute, moving so fast that they become a blur to the eye, making it nearly impossible for foes to land an attack. They are also far more cunning than regular cheetahs, able to trip up prey skilled at disengaging from combat. Though primarily used to hunt on the Material Plane, zephyr fangs are well-adapted to their native environment of the Plane of Air. While they cannot fly, they can run across clouds as if they were solid ground and fall like feathers, preventing lethal drops.

Though zephyr fangs are mostly found in the service of djinni, there are many cases where their masters have been captured or killed, leaving the zephyr fangs on their own. These independent zephyr fangs often escape to the Material Plane, where most normal beasts stand little chance once a zephyr fang has honed in on them.

## Deer 
Existing across a vast range of environments in many forms, deer stand out as creatures of elegance, adaptability, and resilience. These graceful beings, ranging from the diminutive and sprightly to the majestic and formidable, embody a blend of agility, strength, and vigilance. 

Deer are also embodiments of agility and sensory acuity. Their lithe forms navigate the densest woods and roughest terrains with effortless grace. Keen senses — acute hearing and a robust sense of smell — keep them ever alert to potential threats, and their threats are many, for deer are often the favored prey of the many predators they share their homes with, from wolves to bears to humanoid hunters. 

Deer are such common prey that, for many humanoid cultures, they've come to be seen as symbols of the hunt. The stamina and endurance of these creatures are legendary. Capable of sustaining high-speed chases across vast distances, deer exhibit a remarkable blend of speed and endurance, qualities that have inspired countless tales and legends throughout the ages of great hunters pursuing particularly elusive deer.

However, deer are far from helpless prey. Adorned with impressive antlers, a hallmark of their kind, the male deer (and some females, depending on species) exhibit a natural prowess in their horned charge. These antlers, far from mere ornaments of courtship, serve as formidable weapons in territorial disputes and self-defense. The deer's charge, a spectacular display of speed and strength, showcases their ability to confront challenges head-on.

Should deer find themselves retreating from attackers, they can utilize their hardened hoofs to deliver a powerful back-kick. This swift and unexpected maneuver enables them to fend off predators and threats even in retreat. The deer's muscular hind legs, engineered for both fleet-footed escapes and potent defense, make them creatures not to be underestimated.

The following are examples of different types of deer across a variety of sizes and power levels. Though it's not a comprehensive list of every type of deer, most other types could still be represented using the stat block of one of the deer presented here.

### Fallow Deer
These deer are as elegant as they are adaptable and grace many landscapes with their presence. Fallow deer can be identified by their impressive antlers and distinctive coats, which are particularly striking, exhibiting a range of colors from light tan with white mottling to dark chocolate brown and sometimes even pure white. The males boast large, unique antlers that are broad and shovel-like, a feature that distinguishes them from other deer species. These antlers are a significant part of their identity, shed and regrown annually.

Fallow deer often form herds, which can be quite large in areas with few natural predators or in protected environments. Their diet primarily consists of grasses, herbs, and leaves, with grazing typically occurring at dawn and dusk. During mating season, males engage in displays of strength and dominance to attract females. This involves intense vocalizations and physical confrontations, a dramatic display of natural behaviors.

Fallow deer are skilled at adapting to various environments. Their ability to run swiftly and leap over obstacles serves them well in evading predators and navigating through different terrains. They are also vigilant and cautious, with keen senses that help them detect potential dangers, an essential aspect of their survival strategy.

In the realms they inhabit, fallow deer are admired for their beauty and the sense of tranquility they bring to their surroundings. Their grazing habits play a significant role in shaping the vegetation of their habitats, underlining their importance in the ecological balance of their ecosystems. Wilderness protectors such as druids and rangers ensure their numbers remain robust as they are vital to the health of their environment and provide an important food source to most large predators.

### Elk 
Known for their impressive stature and striking antlers, elk are among the largest species of deer, with males significantly larger than females. They are distinguished by their impressive antlers, which are some of the largest of any deer species, with a complex, branching structure. These antlers, shed annually, are not just a symbol of their strength but also play a crucial role during the mating season. The elk's thick coat changes from a light tan in summer to a darker brown in winter, providing  camouflage and insulation.

Elk are known for their herd behavior. While females and young typically form large herds, males may either join these herds or form smaller groups of their own. These herds are dynamic and can change in size and composition with the seasons. Elks' diet is predominantly grass-based, but they also feed on leaves, bark, and shrubs, showing adaptability in their feeding habits to suit the environment.

During mating season, bulls engage in dramatic displays of strength and dominance to attract mates, including bugling, a loud series of vocalizations, and displaying their antlers. Calves are born with spotted coats for camouflage, a critical survival trait in their early days.

Survival for elk involves a blend of physical prowess and keen instincts. Their large size and strength are their primary defenses against predators. Additionally, their acute hearing and sense of smell enable them to detect danger early. These senses, combined with their speed and power, allow them to fight or flee depending on the threat they face.

In the various realms they inhabit, elk are revered for their beauty and strength. Their majestic presence and mighty antlers make them a prized game for hunters, and many grand hunts focus center on the pursuit of a majestic elk. Creatures tied to the fey wild, such as elves, sometimes utilize elk as swift and powerful mounts, allowing them to gracefully bound through the wilds before crashing into foes with the antlers of their wild steed.

### Megaloceros
These primeval deer dwell in remote time-lost tundras alongside other ancient megafauna. Megaloceros are one of the largest deer species to have ever lived, with males displaying a remarkable set of antlers, some of the largest in any deer species, both in width and length. These antlers, which can span up to 12 feet from tip to tip, are not only a display of dominance but a tool used in mating rituals and defense against predators. Their robust and muscular bodies are covered in a thick coat of fur that varies in color, aiding them in adapting to colder climates.

The social and breeding behaviors of the megaloceros are similar to those of other deer, with males vying with each other during mating season. The males use their impressive antlers to gain the attention of females and to establish dominance within their herds. These antlers also serve as a menecing warning to any who would threaten the herd.

Survival for megaloceros, given their size and habitat, involves a blend of sheer physical presence, speed, and honed senses. Their large antlers, while majestic, can present navigational challenges, particularly in maneuvering dense forests. As a result, megaloceros prefer to roam open grassy landscapes where they can leverage their size and speed.

## Elephants
Elephants are colossal, intelligent beasts found in grasslands, savannas, and dense forests. Known for their long trunks and massive tusks, these creatures use their trunks with remarkable dexterity to grasp objects, gather food, and communicate. Their tusks serve both as tools for digging and stripping bark and as formidable weapons for defense and combat. Elephants are herbivores, consuming vast quantities of vegetation daily, including grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark.

Elephants thrive in regions with abundant water and vegetation, often found near rivers, lakes, and watering holes. They are social animals, typically forming close-knit herds led by a matriarch. These herds consist of related females and their young, while males often roam independently or form smaller bachelor groups. Elephants are known for their impressive memories and complex social structures, using a variety of vocalizations and body language to communicate within their herds.

These creatures are renowned for their sheer physical strength. They can easily uproot trees, push over large obstacles, and trample threats underfoot.

  Their thick skin provides significant protection against attacks, and their large ears help regulate body temperature in hot climates. Despite their size, elephants can move with surprising speed when necessary, capable of charging at high speeds to deter predators or intruders.

Some cultures train and use elephants as beasts of burden, taking advantage of their strength to carry heavy loads or perform laborious tasks. In times of war, elephants are sometimes employed as war beasts, outfitted with armor and used to break enemy lines or cause chaos on the battlefield. Hunters may seek their tusks for ivory, leading to potential conflicts with those who revere or protect these majestic creatures. Elephants are also revered in some societies, symbolizing strength, wisdom, and longevity, and are often featured in religious or cultural ceremonies.

These towering beasts inspire awe and respect, and wise adventurers approach them with caution, recognizing their immense power and intelligence. Whether encountered in the wild or in the service of humanoids, elephants remain one of the most formidable and respected creatures in the natural world.

***Dwarf Elephants.*** Dwarf elephants are a fascinating variation of their larger relatives, primarily found on isolated islands and in secluded forested regions. These creatures, though significantly smaller in size, retain many of the characteristics of their larger kin. Standing only about the height of a human, dwarf elephants have adapted to environments where resources are limited, allowing them to thrive in places where their larger counterparts could not. Their smaller stature makes them exceptionally agile, able to navigate dense underbrush and rocky terrain with ease. Despite their size, they possess the same intelligence and social complexity, often forming tight-knit family groups that exhibit strong bonds and cooperative behaviors.

Dwarf elephants are herbivores, feeding on a diet of leaves, fruits, and bark. They use their smaller yet equally dexterous trunks to forage and manipulate their environment. Their tusks, though shorter and more curved, are used for digging, foraging, and defense against predators. These creatures are also known for their remarkable memory and problem-solving abilities, traits that have helped them survive in challenging environments. Humanoids might encounter dwarf elephants while exploring remote regions or seeking rare resources unique to their habitats. Some cultures might domesticate them for labor, transportation, or ceremonial purposes, valuing their strength and gentle nature. However, as with their larger relatives, dwarf elephants are to be respected and approached with caution, as they are capable of defending themselves with surprising force if threatened.

***Savannna Elephants.*** Savannah elephants, the largest and most iconic of their kind, are found wandering the expansive grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands of temperate and tropical regions. Towering over other creatures, these giants can reach over ten feet in height. Their distinctive, large ears serve multiple purposes: regulating body temperature and enabling long-distance communication through trumpeting calls and infrasonic rumbles. The elephants' long, curved tusks are indispensable tools for foraging and formidable weapons in conflicts.

Living in structured social groups, savannah elephants are typically led by a matriarch, the oldest and most experienced female. These herds consist of related females and their offspring, while adult males usually live solitary lives or join bachelor groups. Known for their incredible memory and navigation skills, these elephants travel vast distances to find food and water, often following ancient migratory routes. This movement is crucial for their ecosystem, as they disperse seeds and create water holes that benefit other wildlife.

Humanoids may seek to tame these colossal beasts as mounts or labor animals, capitalizing on their immense strength for warfare or heavy lifting. The elephants' tusks, believed to possess magical properties, become coveted items for enchantment and trade, drawing the interest of adventurers and merchants.

***Palaeoloxodons.*** Palaeoloxodons, or dire elephants, are even larger and more imposing than mammoths, often exceeding fourteen feet at the shoulder. They are characterized by exceptionally long, straight tusks and thick, leathery skin that offers protection against predators and harsh conditions.

Found in temperate and subtropical regions, palaeoloxodons thrived in both forests and plains, consuming vast amounts of vegetation. Their powerful trunks were used for foraging and communication through vocalizations and gestures. They formed large herds led by a matriarch, displaying strong familial bonds and cooperative behavior.

Many cultures revere palaeoloxodons as symbols of ancient power and wisdom. Their tusks are highly sought after for creating powerful artifacts and weapons believed to hold magical properties. Legends often depict them as guardians of sacred sites or ancient secrets, with their long lifespans granting them knowledge of bygone eras.

Encounters with palaeoloxodons are awe-inspiring and potentially perilous. While generally peaceful, they become formidable opponents if provoked. Some tribes coexist with these giants, respecting their migratory paths, but conflicts can arise when these paths intersect with human settlements or resource-rich areas. Palaeoloxodons embody the untamed and enduring spirit of the natural world.

### Elephant Loot
The valuable items looted from elephants will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of an elephant. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Elephant Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Lions

Lions are majestic and formidable predators found in grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands. They are renowned for their muscular build, powerful limbs, and sharp claws, which make them exceptional hunters. The males are easily recognized by their magnificent manes, which serve as both protection in battles and a display of dominance. Females, who lack manes, are the primary hunters, working together in coordinated groups to bring down prey.

Lions typically hunt large herbivores, relying on stealth, strength, and teamwork. They are capable of short bursts of intense speed to ambush their targets, often taking down animals much larger than themselves. Their powerful jaws and teeth deliver fatal bites to the neck or throat of their prey. Lions are also known for their intimidating roars, which can be heard up to five miles away and serve to communicate with pride members and ward off intruders.

Lions are social animals, living in prides that consist of related females, their offspring, and a coalition of males. These prides maintain and defend territories that can span many miles. Within the pride, there is a strict social structure, with dominant males protecting the group and siring cubs. The cohesion and cooperation of the pride are vital to their survival, as they rely on each other for hunting and defense.

Some cultures revere lions as symbols of courage, strength, and nobility, incorporating their imagery into heraldry and art. Warriors and hunters may seek to prove their bravery by confronting lions, either for sport or as a rite of passage. Lions’ pelts and claws are prized for their use in crafting armor, weapons, and other items believed to bestow the wearer with the creature’s strength and ferocity.

Additionally, lions might be tamed or trained by skilled beastmasters for use in battle or as guardians for important locations. However, such endeavors are fraught with danger, as lions are unpredictable and possess great physical prowess. Encounters with lions, whether in the wild or as part of humanoid society, evoke a mixture of awe, respect, and caution due to their majestic presence and formidable capabilities.

### Dire Lions
Dire lions, much larger and more formidable than their common kin, are found in the expansive tundras and dense forests of colder climates. Standing nearly twice the size of regular lions, dire lions are powerful and resilient, capable of bringing down massive prey such as mammoths and giant elk. Their robust bodies and elongated limbs grant them incredible strength and stamina, allowing them to traverse difficult terrain and endure long, grueling hunts.

Dire lions are more solitary than their savanna relatives, with males and females typically hunting alone or in small family groups. They are highly territorial and fiercely protective of their hunting grounds, often engaging in brutal confrontations with other predators. Their deep, resonant roars echo through the valleys and forests, establishing dominance and deterring rivals.

Dire lions are known for their cunning and strategic approach to hunting, often stalking their prey for hours or even days before launching a decisive attack. Humanoids encountering dire lions might do so in the context of legendary hunts or as part of a quest to retrieve valuable resources from their territory, where these mighty beasts reign as apex predators.

#### Lion Tactics
When lions hunt, they use stealth to surround their prey with other members of their pride, ensuring the target cannot escape. They always aim for the physically weakest targets. If they are spotted before they can surround their target and don't have overwhelming numbers or the target appears extremely strong, they may retreat and attack later.

### Sea Cats

Sea cats are aquatic predators that combine the features of a large feline with those of a powerful fish. They possess the sleek, muscular body of a cat, covered in scales rather than fur, and have a long, finned tail. Their forelimbs are equipped with webbed claws, making them excellent swimmers, while their sharp teeth and claws make them formidable hunters. Sea cats are typically found in coastal waters, reefs, and underwater caves, where they hunt fish, crustaceans, and occasionally larger prey such as dolphins or small whales.

These creatures are known for their cunning and territorial nature. Sea cats often establish hunting grounds that they fiercely defend against intruders, whether other sea creatures or humanoids. Their ability to blend into the underwater environment, combined with their swift and silent movement, makes them effective ambush predators. Sea cats are also known to work in pairs or small groups, coordinating their attacks to herd and capture prey more efficiently.

Some coastal communities regard them with a mix of fear and reverence, believing sea cats to be the guardians of the sea or omens of fortune. Fishermen and sailors might occasionally seek out sea cats for their valuable scales, which are used in crafting armor and decorative items. However, encounters with sea cats can be perilous, as these creatures are not easily tamed and can become aggressive if threatened or disturbed. Adventurers may find themselves facing sea cats when exploring underwater ruins or during quests involving sunken treasures, where the creatures' territories overlap with their objectives.

#### Sea Cat Tactics
Sea cats use similar techniques to lions but in the water. They will also attack creatures on land if they can sneak up within 15 feet of the shoreline. If a sea cat manages to grapple a land creature, it will attempt to drag the prey back into the water. If unsuccessful, it will retreat and abandon the attack.

### Bronzehide Lions
Larger than any natural lion, the bronzehide lion is a formidable beast with a shimmering coat of bronze hair. Its hide is completely impervious to physical damage, and its claws and teeth are as sharp as any forged weapon, effortlessly tearing through flesh.

Bronzehide lions are extremely rare and are not found in any natural environment; they are sent by divine forces. They descend from the heavens to the mortal planes in the form of a comet streaking through the night sky, landing with an impact that shakes the surrounding landscape. Wherever they land, destruction soon follows. Sometimes the lions are sent as punishment to those who have failed to pay tribute to the gods or forsaken divine teachings. More often, however, they are a trial for champions of the gods, serving as the perfect test for a true hero.

Only the skin of the bronzehide lion is impenetrable. A well-placed hit that manages to slide into the lion's mouth and strike the back of its throat, or a perfectly aimed arrow to its eyes, can harm the creature and bypass its defenses. This is no easy task, as a hero must also overcome the lion's immense divine strength and agility while attempting to land the precise strike.

\columnbreak

 The lion's dreadful roar can shatter the nerve of those without courageous hearts, causing them to cower in fear.

However, those who manage to overcome this challenge and slay the beast will not only be favored in the eyes of the gods but will also gain the boon of the creature's skin, which can be made into powerful armor. Several legendary heroes in ancient sagas were said to have worn cloaks made from the bronzehide lion's skin.

#### Bronzehide Lion Tactics
Bronzehide lions are not natural creatures. They are loners that attempt to sneak up on their prey to ambush them. However, they never retreat from battle, even if spotted early, and will fight to the death. These lions target the strongest hero to test their might or anyone who has angered the gods they serve.

Bronzehide lions use their legendary actions to employ their Rake ability if the opportunity arises; otherwise, they use their Dreadful Roar.

> ***Weak Point.*** Whenever a creature has advantage on an attack roll against the lion, it can choose to roll only one die instead of two as it aims for the lion's weak point. If the attack hits, the lion has vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from the attack. The attack still counts as having advantage for the purposes of other abilities such as a rogue's Sneak Attack. If any damage would reduce the lion to 0 hit points that did not target its weak point, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead. The lion only dies if reduced to 0 hit points from damage dealt to its weak spot.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The lion makes two attacks: one with its Bite and one with its Claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the lion can't attack another target.

> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is prone, it deals 23 (4d10 + 5) piercing damage instead and it also must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw as the lion attempts to drive its teeth into the wound. On a failure, the target suffers a rending wound. While wounded, it has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws and checks, as well as attack rolls, and its speed is halved. The wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if the creature regains 10 or more hit points.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d12 + 5) slashing damage. If the lion moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
> 
> ### Legendary Actions
> The lion can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The lion regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Check.** The lion makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Move.** The lion moves up to 20 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity.
>
> **Tenacious Will (Costs 2 Actions).** If the lion is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Dread Roar (Costs 3 Actions).** The lion emits an ungodly roar. Each creature within 90 feet of the lion that can hear the roar must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the lion. While frightened, the creature can't cast spells other than cantrips. The frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Fiendpact Lion
In the relentless struggle for dominance over a pride of lions, many males are too weak to claim their own pride. Though their desire to rule is not as sophisticated as a human's, it is powerful nonetheless. Occasionally, dark forces offer a chance to fulfill this desire. The demon lord of gnolls is known to offer a pact, filling a lion's mind with visions and promises of ruling over a massive pride. Most lions instinctively revile these hallucinations, sensing their taint on an animalistic level. However, some truly desperate lions give in and become servants to the gnoll lord.

The fiendpact lion, born from this pact, loses all the nobility it once held. These lions become cunning monsters, using their newfound guile and intelligence to plot and conquer the pride of their choice, slaying any who oppose them through treacherous means. Lions of the fiend excel at manipulating situations to their advantage, sowing doubt within their targets with fiendish abilities, and preying on isolated individuals. Wherever these creatures go, death follows, increasing the tyrant's power. 

However, this power comes at a great cost. The lion's hunger for power and fresh meat becomes insatiable, and as part of their pact, they must share their lands with gnolls and defiled hyenas. The enslaved pride hunts to feed these loathsome intruders, and a land ruled by a fiendpact lion becomes a barren waste and is ultimately unsustainable. If the fiendish lion cannot uphold its end of the bargain, it must pay with its own flesh to feed its ravenous cohorts.

#### Fiendpact Lion Tactics
Lions of The Fiend avoid fights whenever possible unless they have a significant advantage. If forced into a fight, their primary strategy is to use their Repelling Claw and Whispers of Doubt to isolate a creature, gaining advantage on all attacks against it. These lions will sacrifice any minions they have to gain hit points from their Dark One's Blessing.

While frightened, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from the lion by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

### Oathsworn Lion

On rare occasions when a lion takes over a pride, a strange phenomenon can occur, akin to a paladin taking an oath, but on a primordial level. It is unclear how this happens, but many believe that certain lions can understand their obligation to the well-being of their pride as deeply as a humanoid could.

These lions not only become leaders of their pride but also take on a duty to safeguard their lands from corruption and those who would disrupt the natural cycle of life. This is known as the "Oath of the Pride." Lions that undergo this strange pledge seem to gain a vague intelligence along with a deeper wisdom of the natural world. While they lead their pride in hunts as any other group of lions would, they also hunt down and destroy any malignant presence that threatens their lands.

These monarchs radiate an aura of authority that grants their pride supernatural prowess in hunting. Additionally, they can call down divine challenges with a roar. Perhaps their greatest potential lies in their ability to learn from the past, as these lions can call upon the spirits of their forefathers for guidance in times of need.



\columnbreak

#### Oathsworn Lion Tactics
These lions position themselves at the center of combat, allowing allies to benefit from their aura. They will single out the biggest threat using their Champion Challenge while their allies handle other threats in the area.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Obsessed
> The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

> ***Champion's Challenge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The lion attempts to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that it can see and that can hear the lion within 30 feet of it must make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature and the lion are obsessed with each other for one minute. While the lion is obsessed, it has advantage on attack rolls. The obsession ends if a creature friendly to the lion damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if the lion ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the target.

### Lion Loot
The valuable items looted from lions will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cheetah. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Lion Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Owls
These nocturnal birds of prey are often seen <br> as symbols of wisdom and the ever-present perceptiveness of the wilds.  Though, among some cultures, they are instead viewed as cursed omens of death and misfortune.  Owls can be found swooping across snowy tundras or perched ominously on dead tree branches deep within dark forests, their everpresent hooting echoing through the night.   By day, they are beautiful and sometimes even adorable hunting birds.  But by night, their glowing eyes strike fear into the hearts of travelers, reminding them the wilds are always watching.

***Stealthy Hunters.*** Most owls are less than two feet in length and have wingspans ranging from 1 to 6 feet across.  As such, their primary prey tends to be small rodents and rabbits.  Owls spot their quarry in the dead of night using superior dark vision and hearing.  Their nocturnal prey often relies on hearing to detect predators.  To counter this, owls have developed specialized feathers which allow them to fly slowly and stealthily, catching their unsuspecting meal by surprise.

***Wizarding Familiars.*** The stealth and keen senses of the owl make it a popular familiar amongst magic users.  Its associations with wisdom further its appeal amongst those with scholarly inclinations.  Wizarding schools often make extensive use of owls in their symbology and as familiars used for information gathering and parcel delivery.  Amongst magic users with a more sinister bent, owls can also serve as menacing familiars to spy on enemies and inspire fear and paranoia amongst superstitious commoners.

> ##### Waterlogged Owls
> Unlike most other birds of prey, owls do not possess a waterproof undercoat.  While short periods in the rain won't hinder them, if they become soaked in water, their fluffy feathers will absorb so much of it that they become too heavy and waterlogged to fly.  Owls in this state are extremely vulnerable and must dry out before they can fly again.  If you wish to incorporate this in your games, you can include a rule that owls soaked in water lose their fly speed until they dry off.

&emsp;***Great Horned Owls.*** The great horned owl is among the most far-ranging and dangerous of all its kind. These deadly birds of prey can measure over two feet in length and sport five-foot wingspans. Their talons can deliver crushing forces ten times what a typical human can produce, allowing them to kill most small prey instantly. This hunting prowess allows great horned owls to hunt a wide range of prey with impunity, and some have even been reported hunting animals as large and dangerous as foxes and bobcats.

***Giant Owls.*** In some extremely wild and dangerous areas, man-sized owls hunt much larger prey than their mundane counterparts.  These beasts are favored guardians and companions to many woodland races, and smaller peoples, such as forest gnomes, will even use them as flying steeds.  When giant owls contact traveling humanoids, they will not hesitate to hunt them like any other animal.  Villagers living near giant owl territory rarely travel alone or unarmed and always keep an eye to the treeline. 

***Monstrous Owls.***  Some owls obtain supernatural levels of size and intelligence.  They may be part of a larger species of monstrous owls or may have once been typical owls that were transformed through magical means.  In either case, their enhanced abilities make them deadly foes and powerful allies.  These owls will often align themselves with other fey and intelligent woodland beings.  Some are noble guardians, working with druidic circles to watch over and safeguard the wilds.  Others are brutal killers, serving dark fey as spies and assassins while mercilessly hunting down any who trespass upon their wilds.

### Owlbears
These beasts are monstrous amalgamations of giant owls and grizzly bears.  Owlbears possess the stealthiness and deadly beak of a giant owl, the sheer size, power, and aggression of a grizzly bear, and the heightened senses of both.  They are fiercely territorial hunters and will attack almost anything that crosses their path without provocation.  However, through tremendous effort, some races can train owlbears as fierce guardians and terrifying battle mounts.

***Snowy Owlbears.*** This subspecies of owlbear is native <br> to arctic environments and appears  to be a combination of snowy owl and polar bear.  It behaves much like other owlbears, but its polar bear nature makes it somewhat larger and much heartier than its temperate cousins.  The harshness of its environment also makes it a deadlier and more determined hunter.  Snowy owlbears are unrelenting in their pursuit of prey, willing to climb treacherous mountains and swim through icy waters to secure their kills.

### Strix
All the omens and superstitions regarding owls are made manifest in the dreaded strix.  These fiends are quite literally living curses shaped into the form of a dread owl with glowing malevolent eyes and wings that move in an almost incorporeal and dreamlike fashion.  This leads some to believe they are creations of dark magic, used by wicked spell casters to hunt their victims.  Others believe them to be fiends native to the underworld sent to reap the souls of the damned.  Regardless of their origin or motivation, once a strix has marked someone for death, there is little hope of escaping its terrible curse.  

***The Dread Curse.*** Strixes are cursed omens of death given physical form, and they seek to spread their curse to others.  When a strix marks someone for death, it will stalk its victim, sometimes for nights on end.  This stalking involves waking up the victims with terrifying calls in the night and watching them through darkened windows with shining eyes.  When their prey's mounting dread reaches its peak, the strix will strike, its talons imparting a fatal curse.  The doomed individual then has twenty-four hours to live before their soul is violently ripped from their body by the curse.  The only way to break to curse is to hunt down the strix and nail it to a wooden door, dead or alive, using an iron nail.

***Servants of Dark Powers.*** Strixes often act in the service of dark masters.  Hags and witches may summon a strix to enact vengeance upon someone who has crossed them, underworld fiends may send strixes to collect souls they've won through dark dealings, and dark wizards may summon strixes to use as twisted familiars.  Regardless of its master or mission, the strix will act with a single-minded malevolent determination to carry out its dark purpose.

## Rhinos

Rhinoceroses are massive, thick-skinned beasts found in grasslands, savannas, and dense forests. Equipped with formidable horns for defense, these herbivores primarily feed on grasses, leaves, and shrubs. Despite their bulk, rhinos move with surprising speed and agility. Typically solitary, they come together for mating and rearing young.

Thriving in temperate and tropical regions, rhinos are often found near rivers, lakes, and mud wallows, which help cool them and protect their skin from parasites and sunburn. Their keen sense of smell compensates for poor eyesight, allowing them to detect threats and find food.

Known for their trampling charge, rhinos can knock down and crush foes with devastating force. Their thick hide offers significant protection, making them resistant to natural predators and humanoid hunters alike.
Humanoids encounter rhinos for various reasons. Some hunt them for their valuable horns, leading to conflicts with rangers and druids. In rare cases, domesticated rhinos serve as beasts of burden or war mounts. Gathering resources from rhino habitats can also lead to conflicts, as these territorial creatures will charge intruders.

***Jungle Rhinos.*** Jungle rhinos inhabit dense tropical rainforests, where their smaller size allows them to navigate thick underbrush with surprising agility. These elusive creatures are characterized by their shaggy, reddish-brown hide and solitary nature, often found near secluded water sources deep within the jungle. Unlike their savanna cousins, jungle rhinos have adapted to their environment with a keen sense of hearing and smell, compensating for limited visibility in dense foliage. They primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and bark from a variety of rainforest plants. Humanoids might encounter jungle rhinos while exploring these remote areas, either as part of efforts to study their habitats or in search of rare botanical resources. However, any intrusion into their territory is likely to provoke a fierce defensive response.

***White Rhinos.*** White rhinos are massive, thick-skinned beasts primarily found in vast grasslands and savannas, where they graze on the abundant grasses that dominate these landscapes. These rhinos are distinguished by their broad, square-shaped mouths, which are specially adapted for grazing. White rhinos are generally more social than their forest-dwelling counterparts, often seen in small groups led by a dominant female. Despite their immense size and seemingly cumbersome appearance, they can move swiftly when threatened, reaching impressive speeds to evade danger or charge at potential threats.

These rhinos are highly territorial, using their horns and formidable strength to defend their domain from intruders. Their skin, while tough, is sensitive and requires regular mud wallowing to protect against parasites and sunburn. The keen senses of white rhinos, particularly their sense of smell, play a crucial role in detecting predators and communicating with other rhinos. Their loud snorts and grunts can be heard across the plains, signaling their presence to others nearby.

Humanoids interact with white rhinos for various reasons, including the pursuit of their valuable horns, which are highly prized for their utility and supposed mystical properties. Druids or other naturalists may seek to study and protect these majestic creatures. Occasionally, white rhinos are trained and utilized as formidable beasts of burden or even war mounts, leveraging their immense strength and durability. However, any approach toward these powerful creatures must be made with caution, as their territorial nature and defensive capabilities make them formidable opponents.

If the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the rhino's horn, causing it to be grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 13 (3d8) piercing damage at the start of each of the rhino's turns, and the rhino can't grapple another creature with its gore.

***Elasmotheriums.***
Elasmotheriums are colossal, thick-furred beasts that once roamed the vast steppes and plains of a bygone era. Towering above most creatures, these majestic rhino-like animals are distinguished by a single, massive horn protruding from their foreheads, often reaching lengths of several feet. This horn, used for defense and digging through snow or soil for roots, is a symbol of their immense strength and dominance. Elasmotheriums are primarily solitary, wandering their territories alone, though they sometimes form small herds during migration periods or in regions with abundant food.

Adapted to colder climates, elasmotheriums possess a dense coat that insulates them against harsh weather, allowing them to thrive in regions where other creatures might struggle. Their diet consists mainly of grasses and hardy shrubs, which they can access even in snowy conditions thanks to their powerful horns and muscular build. Despite their size, elasmotheriums can move with surprising speed, making them formidable when charging at threats or rivals.

Scholars and historians venture into remote regions to study these living relics, hoping to gain insights into ancient times. In some cultures, encountering an elasmotherium is a mystical experience, and these creatures are revered as embodiments of the primeval world. Adventurers often seek them not for conquest but for the honor of witnessing a living piece of history. Attempts to tame them aim to harness their raw, ancient power for extraordinary tasks, though most such attempts are met with devastating failure.

Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 19 (4d12) piercing damage at the start of each of the elasmotherium's turns, and the elasmotherium can't grapple another creature with its gore.

### Rhinoceros Loot
The valuable items looted from rhinos will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a rhino. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Rinoceros Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

# Tigers
The largest and deadliest of all cats, <br> tigers are the kings of their domain. <br> Their power and beauty elevate <br> them to an almost mythical status <br> amongst many humanoids.  Some <br> view them as the wrath of the gods <br> made flesh, while others see them <br> as the ultimate predators against which one can <br> truly test their metal. 

***Predators Supreme.*** Tigers can reach over 10 <br>  feet in length, and their intensely muscular bodies <br> can weigh nearly 700 pounds.  Due to their sheer <br> mass and power, few creatures are safe from a <br> tiger's predation. Thanks to the tiger's striped <br> camouflage and long pouncing distances, even animals <br> large and powerful enough to pose a threat to a tiger rarely notice it in time to mount an effective defense. Thanks to their deadly ambush capabilities, tigers can hunt down larger creatures as dangerous as mountain gorillas and even brown bears.  

Once a tiger surprises its prey with a pounce, it will knock its victim prone and use its claws and teeth to lock down and quickly finish the kill.   A prone victim has little chance of fighting back and is rapidly ripped apart before being dragged off by the tiger to be consumed. 

***Maneaters.*** While tigers primarily hunt animals living across jungles, forests, and occasionally mountains, they often hunt stray humanoids when the opportunity presents itself. A lone traveling humanoid will usually be seen as an easy meal to a tiger, and some may even be bold enough to attempt to pick off a humanoid traveling with a group.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some notorious tigers take a personal liking toward hunting humanoids. A tiger that has been "wronged"  by someone will often make a point of hunting down and exacting vengeance upon the offender. These offenders are usually individuals who injured the tiger in a previous encounter or stole one of its kills. Other tigers will decide to make humanoids their primary prey.   These tigers will stalk the outskirts of isolated villages and pick off stray inhabitants, leaving the population terror-stricken.

&emsp;***Dire Tigers.*** These primeval terrors represent the dangerous aspects of the tiger amplified to a greater level of deadliness.  They are larger and more muscular than other tigers, reaching nearly 900 pounds.  They are bolder than other tigers and attack humanoids without hesitation, even those traveling in groups.  They are more resilient than other tigers, and even groups of veteran hunters often fail to slay these mighty beasts.

Many believe dire tigers to be the ancient cousins of "modern tigers" and remnants from a long-lost age.  Whatever their origin, they are often put to use by other beings who wish to punish or test the metal of humanoid adventurers.  Druids enlist the aid of dire tigers to protect their realms from unwanted incursions, and divine forces may unleash dire tigers upon mortals as a form of deadly punishment for their transgressions.

## Weretigers
These lycanthropes blend the hunting <br> prowess of a tiger with the intelligence <br> and versatility of a humanoid, creating <br> proud individuals who view themselves <br> as apex hunters.  
While not evil by nature, weretigers often have a <br> superiority complex that drives them to hunt all <br> manner of dangerous game to demonstrate <br> their place at the top of the food chain.  This <br> hunting is done with a detached refinement, and <br> weretigers will rarely revert to their bestial forms <br> if they can help it, preferring to remain calm and in control.  

Though weretigers become frustrated when pushed to the point of losing their cool and transforming into their bestial forms, deep down, they crave the challenge.  While a weretiger may take smug satisfaction from easily dispatching dangerous prey, a true challenge that pushes the limits of its abilities will be a treasured victory.  

Weretigers are also very careful about who they pass their lycanthropy to, as they view it as a privilege and a burden.  Weretigers have an exclusivist attitude and are loath to introduce unnecessary and unworthy competition.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, when weretigers find exceptional hunters or even humanoid prey that exceed their expectations, they may choose to pass their lycanthropy onto such individuals, thereby creating worthy rivals for future competitions.

## Wolves
These majestic and deadly hunters roam many of the world’s forests and tundras, using their brutally effective pack-hunting tactics to fell much larger and more dangerous animals. Wolves strike fear in the hearts of humanoids who venture too far into the wilds, and their notoriety has earned them a place as common monsters and villains in many fables and children’s tales. The sounds of distant howling will alert travelers that they are entering wolf territory, and few do so willingly unless traveling in a well-armed group. Any travelers who become lost and isolated in the woods will have little hope of survival should a pack of wolves pick up their scent.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


***Master Pack Hunters.*** 
Those who catch the attention of a wolf pack will often be oblivious to their peril as the pack silently stalks its prey, slowly closing in until they are noticed. Once the pack is spotted, it will close in and attempt to drive its prey into fleeing. Sufficiently powerful prey that stands its ground and proves intimidating enough may be able to drive the wolves away. Wolves that press the attack will attempt to separate the weakest-looking target from its companions and drag it to the ground, where it can be subdued with vicious bites. Even if the prey manages to flee, the wolves will relentlessly pursue it until they are able to surround and slaughter their victim.

&emsp; ***Fiercely Loyal Allies.*** The group dynamics and hunting strategies of wolves are similar enough to most <br> humanoids that they are often able to integrate <br> themselves into tribes living far from civilization. These wolves might live amongst druidic circles, barbarian <br> tribes to the north, orcish warbands, or goblinoid <br> warrens. Regardless of the group, the wolf's instinct <br> toward teamwork and loyalty to hierarchical packs leaves <br> it well suited to many vital roles. Wolves will serve their adopted families as sentries, hunters, and war beasts in combat. They are adept at following verbal and somatic instructions from their humanoid companions to <br> coordinate their efforts.

***Dire Wolves.*** These primeval wolves are a more <br> primitive and savage version of their modern kin. They are more often found in wilder regions that have remained untouched by civilization. Here, they prey on large game <br> as well as any humanoids attempting to eke out an <br> existence in the unforgiving wilds. Like ordinary wolves, <br> dire wolves are prized allies amongst any humanoids able <br> to humanoids able to tame or befriend them, though this <br> is a difficult and dangerous prospect for any without <br> druidic abilities. As dire wolves are often favored by gods <br> of winter or the hunt, they may also be sent to aid those <br> who curry the favor of such gods. Though, just are just as likely to be sent to hunt and devour those who displease <br> the gods by daring to challenge the might of the wilds.

### Ascendant Packleader


Wolves blend ferocity, beauty, and teamwork in such a way that many humanoids regard them with a sense of awe that borders on reverence. As such, they are a favored animal among many celestial beings and a common form for sacred beasts to assume. Ascendant packleaders are a form of divine wolf created to lead wolf packs on the Material Plane in service of a higher purpose. They may have once been ordinary wolves elevated to divine status or celestials who took on a lupine form when they entered the Material Plane. 

Once an ascendant packleader has taken command of a wolf pack, it leads its lupine brethren with supernatural efficiency. Packleaders can bark orders at their pack mates, enabling them to perform complex tactical maneuvers normally beyond the capabilities of such creatures, and their supernatural howls can break the resolve of prey while driving their allies to victory. 

Using these powers of command, the ascendant packleader also drives its pack to pursue higher-level goals normally beyond the comprehension of ordinary wolves. These goals may simply be to protect a sacred wood, or they may involve furthering large-scale agendas in service of a god or other divine being. The nature of these goals and the packleaders pursuing them are as varied as the gods they serve. Noble packleaders act in service to gods seeking to protect the sanctity of life and nature, while brutal packleaders sent by wicked gods of the wilds take cruel pleasure in hunting humanoids and undoing the works of civilization.

>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ***Hunter's Howl (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).***  The packleader may move up to its speed before emitting a howl that terrifies its prey and rallies its pack. Up to 6 allies within 120 feet of the packleader can use their reaction to perform one of the options described in its Bark Order ability. They must all use the same option, which the packleader chooses. Each other creature within 120 feet of the packleader must then succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the packleader. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Bark Order.***  The packleader emits a commanding bark and chooses one creature other than itself within 60 feet of it that can hear it. That creature can then use its reaction to do one of the following: 
>
> &#8226; It moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
>
> &#8226; It makes one melee weapon attack or unarmed strike. If the attack has advantage from at least two sources, and one of them is due to the target being prone, the attack deals an extra 7(2d6) damage.
>
> &#8226; If the creature is suffering an effect that requires it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its next turn, it immediately makes that save.

## Wolf Encounter Guide

Wolves are a classic, low-level enemy for fledgling adventurers to face in the wild. Dire wolves are larger and provide a greater challenge but operate in the same manner. Like most predatory beasts, players are likely to encounter wolves when they wander into a pack’s territory, a desperately hungry pack is hunting them, or the wolves are being used as war beasts by other humanoids. 

Regardless of the encounter’s circumstances, wolves rely on their numbers and pack tactics to overwhelm their foes. Wolves aren’t likely to attack humanoids unless they outnumber them or are starving. Dire wolves may be more brazen about attacking in smaller numbers due to their size advantage over humanoids. Still, even they aren’t likely to attack if their prey outnumbers them and appears in good condition. 

### Wolf Motivations
Being beasts, wolves usually have straightforward motivations driving their goals. A wolf pack lead by an ascendant packleader may have a more complex agenda.

#### General Wolf Motivations
* Hunt for food
* Protect territory
* Act in service or protection of those it perceives as packmates

#### Ascendant Packleader Motivations
* Serve the sacred purpose it was created for


### Wolf Tactics
While wolves may be beasts with simple motivations, they excel at hunting in packs and are capable of coordinated group tactics in combat. They utilize the same tactics when hunting in the wild or with humanoid masters.

#### Engagement

With their Keen Sense, wolves are likely to detect potential prey before they themselves are noticed. The wolves will then attempt to stalk and stealthily approach their prey, closing in as close as possible before being seen. Once spotted, the wolves try to drive their prey into fleeing. They may use intimidation or run at a target in an attempt to spook it, but they prefer to stay out of striking distance of creatures standing their ground. 

\columnbreak

#### Combat

If one or more creatures run, the wolves will chase after them unless isolated targets are left behind for the wolves to surround. If multiple creatures scatter, the wolves will close in on one target. Wolves will chase prey long distances, exhausting their victims before closing in for the kill. If a wolf can close the distance, it will attempt to use its trip attack, hampering the target’s ability to flee and giving other wolves a chance to close in from all sides.

If all the creatures stand their ground, they make themselves much less appealing prey to the wolves. The pack may attempt to isolate and surround one target if it looks like they can get a quick kill. If their prey poses a formidable threat to the wolves, they are unlikely to attack unless starving or under some supernatural influence. 


##### Combat: Ascendant Packleader
If an ascendant packleader leads the wolf pack, they will operate with a higher level of tactical complexity. They typically initiate combat with their Hunter’s Howl, which not only helps their allies close distance on prey but frightens the prey into running, setting up the chase scenario wolves prefer. They can then use their Bark Orders bonus action during combat to keep their pack mates in the action and focusing on high-priority targets.

#### Retreat

If the wolves do engage in combat, they will usually be quick to flee if it appears the tide is turning against them. Any individual wolf is likely to flee once it loses 10 percent of its health unless it is desperately hungry, in which case it may fight until it has lost 50 to 60 percent of its health. If half or more of a wolf pack has fled and their opponents still appear to be in fighting condition, the remaining wolves will typically retreat.

##### Retreat: Ascendant Packleader
Wolves being led by an ascendant packleader will often fight to the death so long as their leader commands them. The packleader will usually call for a retreat if the pack is losing the fight unless doing so would violate their sacred duty. If the packleader is slain, the wolves may go mad and attempt to avenge its death or revert to acting like normal wolves and retreat.

## Wolf Loot Guide
Wolves generally won’t carry items, so most of their loot will take the form of whatever can be harvested from their bodies.

### Lootable Wolf Items
The following table lists the types of materials likely to be harvested from wolves and the suggested skills your players can use to attempt their harvest.  If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

#####  Wolf Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
|  Hide  |Dexterity (Leatherworker's Tools) or Wisdom (Survival) |
|  Flesh | Dexterity (Cook's Utensils) or Wisdom (Survival)  | 
|  Blood or Bone | Intelligence (Medicine) or Wisdom (Survival)  |  



<br>The number of items harvested and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their harvesting check. You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.




\columnbreak


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Hide |Flesh | Blood | Bones |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  5sp  | Tattered Wolf Pelt | Stringy Wolf Meat  | Clotted Wolf Blood | Fractured Wolf Bones | 
|  1gp |  Wolf Pelt |  Wolf Meat  | Wolf Blood | Wolf Bones |
|  5gp | Pristine Wolf Pelt |  Wolf Heart  | Pristine Wolf Blood | Pristine Wolf Bones |
|  10gp| Runic Wolf Pelt |  Primeval Wolf Heart  | Primeval Wolf Blood | Runic Wolf Bones |



### Wolf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to harvest depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're harvesting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time. 

If you don't want to require a check on the part of the players, you can instead roll a d20 with the modifier determined by the table to determine what the players find randomly.




##### Wolf & Dire Wolf Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3  |  Wolf Loot |  Dire Wolf Loot |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
|  1-5  | Nothing | Nothing  |
