## Sackin' Da Sanctuary  <br> (Player Level: 5-6)
This encounter involves the players calling on divine power to repel an orc shaman from a church he is attempting to defile.


### Approaching the Church
The orc shaman is dancing and chanting outside the church in a large area, accompanied by three orcs, They are distracted and easy to sneak past if the players wish. If any players understand Orcish, they will realize that the shaman is performing a victory chant, giving thanks to the gods. The party is free to attack the orcs, which will begin the encounter outside.

### Inside The Church
The inside of the church is completely wrecked, with debris scattered everywhere. At the far side of the church is an altar with the bottom half of a knight sculpture reared up. Inside the church is a woman named Helenea Krügen, who weakly crawls out from underneath some nearby debris.

#### Helenea Krügen
Helenea **commoner** had come to the church to pray when the orcs attacked. The priest invoked the power of their god through a golden tablet that once belonged to a high priest, hoping to repel the orc forces. However, the orc shaman leading the group cast terrible spells, shattering the statue at the altar and destroying the tablet, sending its pieces flying across the church. A piece of the statue struck Helenea, causing her to black out. She tells the party that the god is still watching over them and will not let the orcs get away with their defilement. She urges the players to find the remaining pieces of the tablet.

#### Finding The Tablet Pieces
The players can spend about 10 minutes searching the church for pieces of the tablet by making Investigation checks to sift through the rubble. Any player that rolls a 15 or higher finds one piece. There are a total of four pieces of the tablet that can be recovered. After the players complete their search, they should hear the orcs completing their ritual, and Helenea warns them they don't have time for more searching.

#### Performing the Holy Rites
Once the players have at least one piece of the tablet, they can attempt the ritual at the altar. To do this, they must make a Wisdom (Religion) check while reading the scriptures on the tablet, filling in any missing parts as best they can. The players receive a +2 bonus to the roll for each piece of the tablet they have. The result of the check determines the blessings they receive as shown below:

**20 or higher** – One player (chosen by the DM) is affected by the *divine shield* spell, along with the effects listed below.

### Orc Attack
When the tablets are read, the orc shaman will sense the power of the ritual within the church and become aware of the party's presence. He and his minions will then enter the church and begin their attack.

#### Orc Shaman Tactics
Orc shamans focus on using their spells to disrupt other spell casters, limit enemy movement, and grant boosts to the combat powers of their allies. They should stay close to their allies in combat to gain the boost to their War Channeler trait.

#### Spell Usage

&emsp;**Stomping Foot:** Great opening move to force grouped enemies to spread out into unfavorable positions. Focus on prone creatures to gain bonus damage. Minions should use the shove action on their turns to knock creatures prone.

**Here We Go:** Cast immediately if there are companions of CR 2 or higher and if it can hit two or more targets with the Stomping Foot spell. Definitely cast if there is an orc boss or warboss among the group.

**Arcane Hand:** If *foot of the gods* is not available, use this concentration spell. Primarily used to grab backline opponents and drag them into melee combat.

**Eadbuta:** Use to break the concentration of enemy spellcasters. Priority over all other spells if an opposing spellcaster is concentrating on a higher-level spell than the Shaman can cast.

**Brain Burst:** Use frequently to disrupt enemy spellcasters.

**Brutal Stare:** Use whenever you can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity and do not have a 5th or higher level spell available.

**Savage Firsts:** Use when the lesser orc shaman has been cornered in combat.

#### Orc Minion Tactics
&emsp;**Aggressive:** Utilize their aggressive trait to bypass front lines and target vulnerable backline characters.

**Choppers:** Their first attack bonus makes them effective against high AC targets with low hit points, maximizing initial impact.

### Ending The Encounter
The orc shaman has driven himself and his followers into a frenzy, and they will all fight to the death in the name of their gods. If the players flee, the shaman will remain in the church to destroy the altar and ensure the ritual can't be performed again.

#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in overcoming the orcs can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the orcs without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the orcs, but the players expend significant resources or take heavy damage in the fight.
* **50% XP:** The players slay the shaman but flee the remaining orcs.
* **10% XP:** The players flee the shaman.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 2-4).** 
* Use **lesser orc shaman** stat blocks for the shaman
* Use **orc** stat blocks for the orc minions
* XP Award: 1,000 XP

**Normal Encounter (Level 5-6).** 
* Use **orc shaman** stat blocks for the shaman
* Use **orc brute** stat blocks for the orc minions
* XP Award: 4,000 XP

**Harder Encounter (Level 10-12).** 
* Use **greater orc shaman** stat blocks for the shaman
* Use **iron orc crimson spiller** stat blocks for the orc minions
* XP Award: 12,000 XP

## New Spells

####  Brain Burster
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d8 psychic  damage, and until the end of your next turn, it has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma  checks, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration. 
Additionally, if the creature  attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher before the end of your next turn, it must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot or other resource, the slot or resource isn’t expended.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

####  Brutal Glare
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You fixate on two points within the spell's range, no more than 30 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of glowing force erupt from your eyes, blazing between the two points. Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 force damage. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d10, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

\pagebreakNum


#### Foot of The Gods
*7th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer

You call forth a massive foot from the heavens to crash down onto the battlefield. You select a point you can see, between 30 to 500 feet above you within range. A 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide foot appears at the chosen point and immediately descends. The foot passes through any Huge or smaller creatures and objects until it descends 500 feet or hits a solid surface, or a Gargantuan creature or object, at which point the foot rises back up into the sky to where its descent started. As an action on your turn, you can move the foot up to 30 feet, rotate it, and then have the foot descend in the same way.

Each creature or object the foot comes in contact with while descending must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so. The creature is also pushed along with the foot until it rises back up. If a creature that fails the saving throw is already prone, it takes an additional 2d12 bludgeoning damage.


####  Here We Go!
*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action.
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Paladin, Ranger, Warlock

You chant, imbuing yourself and up to four creatures you can see with fighty energy. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you or a creature you chose misses with an unarmed strike or weapon attack roll, you may have it reroll the attack. The creature must use the new roll.



#### Mind Spike (Revised)
*2nd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Choose one creature that you have seen or heard within the last minute. If that creature is within range, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Additionally, on a failed save, you always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

\columnbreak

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.



#### Psychic Headbutt
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

A disruptive bolt of energy emanates from your head toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. The attack has advantage and cannot have disadvantage if the target is concentrating on a spell. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage. If the creature makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, you may choose to set the saving throw DC equal to your spell save DC.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.




#### Savage Fists
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Druid, Ranger

Your fists become as hard as iron, and you are filled with fighting fury. When you cast this spell, you make an unarmed strike and gain the following benefits for the duration of the spell:

* You can use your spellcasting modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

* You can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

* You may use your spellcasting modifier when making Strength checks instead of your Strength modifier.
