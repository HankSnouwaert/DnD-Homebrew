## Barracks Battle  <br> (Player Level: 6-8)
This encounter involves the players allying with a group of local town guards to take back a barracks that has been invaded by elite iron orc warriors.

### Encounter Context
As the players draw near the barracks, a soldier will covertly approach them and tell them that a small group of soldiers has taken refuge within a nearby dwelling. If the players follow the soldier back, they will find six other soldiers. 

#### Rallying The Soldiers
The players can try convincing the soldiers to help them fight to retake the barracks. The soldiers are extremely frightened and have lost faith in the battle, so the players will have to convince them they have a chance. If a skill check is being used as part of this convincing, you can use the following DCs as a guideline for how many soldiers they are able to convince:

**20 or higher:** All of the soldiers are convinced

**15 - 19:** Four of the soldiers are convinced

**9 - 14:** Three of the soldiers are convinced

**8 or less:** None of the soldiers are convinced

### Encounter Terrain

#### The Barracks
The barracks is a two-story high-structure wooden structure with a basement. Its windows can be broken through, and its sides can be climbed with a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check.

#### The Trees
The encounter map features large 20-foot tall trees that can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics check outlined on the map.)

Creatures with a climb speed that are within 5 feet of the trunk don't need to make a check. Creatures in a tree have half cover and are lightly obscured. Each tree trunk has 50 hit points, an AC of 15, immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage. If a tree is destroyed, any creatures in the tree immediately fall out.

### Running the Encounter
Allow the players to be creative in how they plan to assault the barracks. The soldiers should inform them that there are about 12 orcs in the compound, four of which are highly trained warriors. The orcs are spread throughout the barracks in small groups, keeping watch over the area. Once a group of orcs spots the players, they will let out a bellow to alert the rest of the orcs. However, orcs that are not within the immediate vicinity will be surprised during the first round of combat.

#### The Soldiers
Any soldiers the players have convinced to join them will follow the players' directions as needed, as long as the orders are not suicidal.

#### The Battle
Once the battle begins, the orcs will attempt to target the soldiers first. To add tension, don't have the soldiers die outright at 0 hit points. Instead, allow them to be stabilized with a successful Medicine check or healed and brought back into the fight.


#### Orc Archer Tactics

&emsp;**Positioning:** Maintain distance to engage vulnerable targets with ranged attacks.

**Tactical Movement:** In ranged firefights, use the Aggressive trait to close distances and engage in melee, overwhelming opposing ranged attackers.

**Pre-Melee Action (Hole Puncher only):** Before moving into melee, use their *Devastating Draw* ability, if available, to maximize damage output.

#### Iron Orc Tactics
&emsp;**Armed To The Teeth.** Iron orcs choose their weapons based on the composition and characteristics of their enemies:

* **Pike Chopper:** Selected when facing multiple highly mobile fighters, such as monks or rogues, to counteract their agility.

* **Greataxe Chopper:** Preferred against classes that rely on a few powerful attacks, such as paladins, barbarians, and rogues, to maximize damage during encounters.

* **Mace Chopper:** Effective against spellcasters, especially those concentrating on high-level spells, to disrupt their casting and focus.

**Fighting In Larger Forces.** The role of an iron orc is to disrupt foes to allow other orcs to deal more damage. If there are multiple iron orcs, each one can pick a different weapon mastery and focus on disrupting specific players, generally prioritizing the players with the most health while allowing other orcs to focus on softer targets. 

**Crimson Spiller Tactics.** These orcs will prefer whichever weapon can hit two or more targets simultaneously, leveraging area-of-effect attacks for greater efficiency compared to multiple single-target attacks.

\columnbreak

**Immortal Tactics.** The Immortals are known for their adaptability. When ***Da New Plan*** is triggered, it is used as an opportunity to change up their strategy and adapt to how the fight's going.


#### NPCs Retreating
The iron orcs will never willingly flee from battle. Lesser orcs will only flee if no iron orcs remain. The soldiers that have joined the players may attempt to run if the battle starts going poorly or if they see their comrades dying.

### Aftermath 
If the players flee, the orcs will remain to hold the barracks until they have reinforcements with which to pursue the players. If the players successfully capture the barracks, the remaining soldiers will take up positions within it and use it to resupply.



#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in taking the barracks while minimizing casualties can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The barracks is captured, and no soldiers die.
* **100% XP:** The barracks is captured, and up to three soldiers died. 
* **50% XP:** The barracks is captured, and four or more soldiers died. 
* **10% XP:** The players failed to capture the barracks.



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Normal Encounter (Level 6-8).** 
* Use **pikeman soldier** stat blocks for the soldiers
* Use **orc archer** stat blocks for the orc archers
* Use **orc** stat blocks for orc warriors
