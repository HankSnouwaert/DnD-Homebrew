## Da Boss's Warcry  <br> (Player Level: 9-11)
This encounter involves the players stopping an orc boss and his warband from raiding a town even as he continues to call more reinforcements into the fight.



### Lead Up
The players will encounter an initial group of orcs ransacking the streets. When the players engage them in combat, they will respond with a warcry that alerts other nearby orcs, including the boss. 

### Running The Encounter
The initial group of orcs will immediately attack the players in the first round of combat. At the beginning of the second round of combat, have the second wave of orcs appear and roll initiative for them. Do the same for the third wave of orcs that appear at the beginning of the third round of combat.

#### Orc Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs. 

##### Orcs and Orc Brutes
&emsp;**Aggressive:** Utilize their aggressive trait to bypass front lines and target vulnerable backline characters.

**Choppers:** Their first attack bonus makes them effective against high AC targets with low hit points, maximizing initial impact.

##### Orc Archers and Hole Punchers

&emsp;**Positioning:** Maintain distance to engage vulnerable targets with ranged attacks.

**Tactical Movement:** In ranged firefights, use the Aggressive trait to close distances and engage in melee, overwhelming opposing ranged attackers.

**Pre-Melee Action (Hole Puncher only):** Before moving into melee, use their *Devastating Draw* ability, if available, to maximize damage output.

##### Iron Orc Tactics

&emsp;**Armed To The Teeth.** Iron orcs choose their weapons based on the composition and characteristics of their enemies:

* **Pike Chopper:** Selected when facing multiple highly mobile fighters, such as monks or rogues, to counteract their agility.

* **Greataxe Chopper:** Preferred against classes that rely on a few powerful attacks, such as paladins, barbarians, and rogues, to maximize damage during encounters.

* **Mace Chopper:** Effective against spellcasters, especially those concentrating on high-level spells, to disrupt their casting and focus.

##### Map Legend

* <font color="918007">**Yellow & Orange Lines:** Fences </font>
* **White Icons:** Initial Wave of Orcs

* <font color="red">**Red Icons:** Third Wave of Orcs </font>
* **O:** Orc Warrior
* **A:** Orc Archer
* **B:** Orc Boss

<br>

&emsp;**Fighting In Larger Forces.** The role of an iron orc is to disrupt foes to allow other orcs to deal more damage. If there are multiple iron orcs, each one can pick a different weapon mastery and focus on disrupting specific players, generally prioritizing the players with the most health.


**Crimson Spiller Tactics.** These orcs will prefer whichever weapon can hit two or more targets simultaneously, leveraging area-of-effect attacks for greater efficiency compared to multiple single-target attacks.

**Immortal Tactics.** The Immortals are known for their adaptability. When ***Da New Plan*** is triggered, it is used as an opportunity to change up their strategy and adapt to how the fight's going.

##### Orc Boss and Orc Warboss Tactics
* Battle Cry and War Surge should be used as soon as possible.
* Recharging the Battle Cry using greataxe attacks is a priority. If the orc boss cannot recharge its Battle Cry on its turn, its minions will try to knock a target prone or use the Help action to give it advantage on its next turn.

##### Iron Orc Boss Tactics
* Follow the same tactics as a regular iron orc.
* Use Brutal Encouragement whenever a creature is suffering from an effect that prevents it from attacking.
* Use Change Da Plan whenever the opponent adapts to the orc's tactics.


### Aftermath
The orc boss will likely fight to the death as long as most of his minions are still fighting. However, if he is severely wounded and obviously losing the battle, he will likely try to flee. Similarly, if the boss has been slain, and the remaining orcs are losing the fight, they will likely start fleeing.

If the players attempt to flee, the boss and his minions will try to chase them through the city, leading to a chase encounter (see the DMG for chase rules).



#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in defeating the orcs can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the orcs without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the orcs, but one or more of their party members were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to defeat the orc boss or the majority of his forces but flee the remaining foes.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating the orc boss or the majority of his forces.
