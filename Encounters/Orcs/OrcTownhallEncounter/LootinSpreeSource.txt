## Lootin' Spree  <br> (Player Level: 2-4)
This encounter involves the players attempting to stop a group of orcs and goblins from looting a town's treasury from its town hall.


### Encounter Setup
The orcs will be stationed around the town hall, keeping watch while three goblins search the town hall for valuables. Another goblin is interrogating restrained civil servants for the location of more valuables, and yet another goblin is keeping watch over the horse and cart stationed right outside the building, which they've stolen and plan to use to haul away their loot.

### Running the Encounter
When the orcs and goblins become aware of the party, they will immediately begin the encounter. The orcs will order the goblins to start loading the cart with valuable items from the piles scattered around the hall while they provide covering fire with ranged attacks as they attempt to fall back. 

The goblins will focus on gathering the loot, using both hands to carry the large amounts at once. Once a goblin has handfuls of loot, it will dash to load it into the horse-drawn cart. If the goblin is wounded, it will command the horse to flee as quickly as possible, leaving its comrades behind. Otherwise, the goblins will wait for more goblins to bring additional loot before escaping. If there is no cart available, the goblins will simply flee the battle with treasure in hand. The goblins are greedy and will prioritize the treasure, even when the odds are overwhelming.

#### Orc Archer Tactics Reminders

&emsp;**Positioning:** Maintain distance to engage vulnerable targets with ranged attacks.

**Tactical Movement:** In ranged firefights, use the Aggressive trait to close distances and engage in melee, overwhelming opposing ranged attackers.

**Pre-Melee Action (Hole Puncher only):** Before moving into melee, use their Devastating Draw ability, if available, to maximize damage output.

### Aftermath 
The primary goal of the orcs and goblins is to escape with their loot. Anyone who manages to get away will prioritize returning to any allied reinforcements they have in the area.
