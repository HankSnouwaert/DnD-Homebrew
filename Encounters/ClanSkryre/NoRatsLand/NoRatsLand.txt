## No Rat's Land <br> (Player Level: 12-14)
In this encounter, the players find themselves in a trench warfare battlefield pitted against a force of ratfolk weapons teams entrenched on the other side of a brutal battlefield.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have somehow been dragged into a warzone where one side is battling against ratfolk with advanced weaponry. The players may be members of the opposing army, have been hired by the said army, or may simply be trying to make their way across the warzone in one piece. In any case, their objective is to eliminate the opposing ratfolk in the trench opposite theirs.


### Lead Up
The players will enter the battlefield along the left trench and be undetected by the ratfolk at first. The players should also have the opportunity to assess the distance to the other trench before the encounter begins. If the players haven't taken action within 5 minutes of entering their trench, the ratfolk not a part of a weapons team look out from their trench and make a (Wisdom) Perception check to attempt to discern the players' location (DC 15 to spot players who aren't hiding). They can repeat this check every 5 minutes. If the players are spotted, the ratfolk will initiate combat by having their poisoned wind mortar teams fire at their location.

### Map Description
* **Trenches.** Both trenches are 10 feet deep, and creatures within them have total cover unless they are attempting to look or shoot over the sides of the trench, in which case they have three-quarters cover. The trenches have ladders and bridges to aid in traversal.
* **Fallen Trees.** Creatures that are Medium or smaller and prone behind a fallen tree gain three-quarters cover.
* **Spiked Posts.** When a creature moves into or within an area with these spikes, it takes 5 (2d4) piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. It can choose to treat the area as difficult terrain to avoid taking damage.


### Running the Encounter
The battle will either start when the players make their presence known by attacking the ratfolk or leaving their trench or when the players are spotted in their trench by the ratfolk, and which point the ratfolk will start firing poisoned wind globes at their location.

Once the players begin moving across the battlefield, the weapons teams will take action.

**Warplock Jezzails (With Rat-Eye Scopes).** These teams will begin sniping at the players, focusing on characters with powerful ranged attacks, particularly those with area-of-effect spells and abilities that can negate the cover ratfolks' trench provides them.

Any ratfolk that aren't part of a team will take up vacant spots on teams left by slain team members or repair weapons that malfunction.

### Aftermath
If the players flee the battlefield, the ratfolk will wait for backup before attempting any sort of pursuit, as their weapons aren't suited for chase scenarios.

Ratfolk who are outnumbered or have no weapons they can reach will attempt to flee. Depending on the situation, they may have other ratfolk forces nearby they will retreat towards.


#### Loot
Most of the valuables the players can recover will come from whatever they can salvage from the weapons (see the loot guide later in this document.) The players can also collect unused fuel/ammo for the weapons. **NOTE:** How much ammo do they have?

#### XP Award: 20,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players slay all the ratfolk and secure their trench withou taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the ratfolk and secure the trench, but the players lost significant resources and/or multiple ratfolk escaped to potentially alert reinforcements. 
* **50% XP:** The players eliminated several weapons teams but fled without defeating all the ratfolk.
* **10% XP:** The players fled without defeating many of the ratfolk.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 9-11).** Remove the upgrades from the weapons. Change the XP award to 10,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 15-17).** Replace each weapon with its more advanced version, remove their upgrades, and replace the ratfolk weapons operators with veteran weapons operators. Change the XP award to 25,000XP.

**Hardest Encounter (Level 17-19).** Replace each weapon with its more advanced version (but keep their upgrades), and replace the ratfolk weapons operators with veteran weapons operators. Change the XP award to 35,000XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Ratfolk Conspiracy.** The players discover evidence that the ratfolk weapons teams were supported by a second force. An enigmatic figure has been supplying the ratfolk clans with advanced weaponry and orchestrating their attacks on various fronts. The party must embark on a quest to uncover the mysterious mastermind behind this ratfolk war. |
|  2  | **The Underground Alliance.** The players' actions have garnered the attention of various ratfolk factions. Some factions seek revenge, while others see an opportunity to forge an alliance with surface-dwelling races against a common enemy. The players are tasked with navigating through diplomatic challenges and potential betrayals as they try to unite the underground and surface races against the ratfolk threat. |
|  3  | **The Surface Siege.** The encounter with the ratfolk weapons teams was just the beginning of a larger invasion force. The ratfolk have launched a full-scale siege on a prominent surface city, and the players find themselves at the forefront of the defense. As the city's last line of defense, the party must rally the people, fortify the city's defenses, and disrupt the ratfolk weapons and supply lines so the siege can be broken.  |
|  4  | **The Hidden Outpost.** The players stumble upon a hidden ratfolk outpost established as a staging ground for future incursions. The outpost's location is strategic, providing access to multiple surface settlements. The adventurers must infiltrate the outpost, disable its communication network, and gather intelligence on the ratfolk's upcoming plans.  |

# Encounter Reference Material


## Two-Creature Weapon Rules
Two-creature weapons require at least two creatures to operate them, and they come with the following additional rules considerations:


### The Weapons Team
The two creatures operating a two-creature weapon are known as the weapons team. The weapons team consists of a leader and a follower. Only one creature can be assigned to each role, and they cannot switch roles once assigned, even if one of the roles becomes vacant, unless they leave the weapons team and rejoin.

#### Joining a Weapons Team

Joining a two-creature weapons team costs a creature's action and half of its movement as it equips its part of the weapon. If one creature is already part of the weapons team, it may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature joining the team. Leaving a weapon team requires no action as the creature drops its part of the weapon.

A creature must have both hands available to be on a weapons team and can't pick anything else up without dropping its part of the weapon.

The creatures within a weapons team must stay within 5 feet of each other and the weapon at all times. If one of them is ever more than 5 feet away from the weapon or the other team member, it is no longer part of the team. 

#### Moving Two-Creature Weapons
The follower can no longer move on its turn except to leave the weapons team. The leader's speed becomes equal to the lowest speed among the creatures on the weapons team. Whenever the leader moves, it can choose to move the follower along with it if the follower is willing, even when the leader is moved against its will. 

#### Stealth
While part of a weapons team, a creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, activating a two-creature weapon reveals the weapons team's location if they are hidden.



### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Two-Creature <br> Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning two-creature weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Actions station
By default, weapons can have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by creatures on their weapons teams. The Load and Crank functions <br> can be activated by the follower, and the Fire <br> function can be activated by the leader. Each <br> function can only be activated once per round. 

#### Load
This function is used by the follower to reload <br> the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. <br> It requires the follower to have immediate <br> access to the weapon's ammunition, and <br> creatures can use their reaction to make <br> opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits <br> the follower this way, it drops the ammo and <br> wastes its action.

#### Crank
Not all weapons have this function. If a weapon <br> does, it must be activated by the follower before <br> each use of the Fire function to move the ammo <br> or fuel through the weapon.

\pagebreakNum





#### Fire
The function is activated by the leader to fire the <br> weapon. When this function is activated, but before <br> its effect occurs, roll to see if a Mishap occurs.

 If a Mishap occurs, its effects happen before the effects of the Fire. This function can't be used if the weapon is out of ammo or if the weapon has a Crank function that hasn't been used since the weapon was last loaded or fired.

### Mishaps
Mishaps represent the weapon experiencing a significant malfunction. There is always a risk of this when firing the weapon, and some weapons have other circumstances that risk a mishap. Whenever this risk occurs, roll a d6. On a result of 1, a Mishap occurs, and the creature who triggered it must roll on the weapon's Mishap Table to determine the nature of this malfunction (see the Mishap Table section).

If the weapon has less than half its hit points, roll 2d6 and take the lowest result when checking for a mishap. 

Unless stated otherwise, you must always check for a mishap when activating the Fire function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Most weapons have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways their functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishap Table.

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

#### Poisoned Wind Mortar Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a poisoned wind mortar. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Acid Blast.** When the weapon's ammo shatter at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the weapon's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (The orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

**Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the weapon's ammo deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

**Warp Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the weapon's ammo, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

#### Poisoned Wind Mortar Tactics
Poisoned wind mortars function as artillery and excel in providing area denial and obscuring the enemies' vision. This tactic proves highly effective when ratfolk forces need to reposition, surprise their enemies, blind opposing ranged attackers, or force them to move. Due to the delicate nature of their ammunition, Poisoned Wind Mortar teams will use their Scurry Away feature to quickly escape whenever an enemy approaches melee range. 

The upgrades for poisoned wind mortars don't alter their tactics but instead enhance their effectiveness in their existing roles.

### Warpfire Throwers

Constructed from rusted metal, corroded pipes, and bizarrely vibrant crystals mined from the deep earth, the warpfire thrower is as terrifying as it is crude. It is a deceptively simple device, consisting of a large, cumbersome tank filled with a mysterious, volatile substance, connected to a projecting nozzle manipulated by its ratfolk wielder.

This enigmatic liquid, known only as "warpfire", is a product of the ratfolk's arcane knowledge and alchemical prowess. Glowing with an eerie, otherworldly light, it is said to be the physical manifestation of raw, chaotic energy harnessed and condensed. When unleashed, the warpfire clings to anything it touches, searing and consuming it with unnatural, green flames.

When the warpfire thrower is fired, a torrent of this deadly warpfire is expelled, engulfing everything in its path. The very air seems to warp and ripple around it, and the heat it generates is so intense it can melt through steel and stone alike. The sight of this horrifying green firestorm is often enough to break the will of even the most hardened warriors.

However, the warpfire thrower is a perilous weapon, even to its handlers. The warpfire is highly volatile and unpredictable, and any misstep, any fault in the device, can result in catastrophic backlashes. It's not uncommon for the thrower to explode in a ball of warpfire, consuming the ratfolk operator and those unfortunate enough to be nearby.

If the safety protocol has been overridden, it is a 40-foot cone instead. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Warpfire Thrower Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warpfire thrower. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Self-Destruct Mechanism.** The team follower may use their bonus action to activate the weapon's self-destruction sequence. At the end of that creature's next turn, the weapon is destroyed in an explosion, and every creature within 30 feet of it is subjected to the weapon's Fire function.

**Motorized Pumps.** Each time the warpfire thrower is cranked, it gains a level of heat that lasts until the weapon goes one full round without being cranked. If the safety protocol is overridden, the warpfire thrower gains two levels of heat. The warpfire thrower's Fire function deals an additional 4 (1d8) fire damage for each level of heat, and when checking for a mishap, a mishap occurs if the number rolled on a d6 is equal to or less than the current heat level.

**Warp Napalm.** If a creature or a flammable object fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire function, it ignites. Until an action is taken to douse the fire, the target suffers 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.



#### Warpfire Thrower Tactics
Warpfire throwers are designed to target the largest clustered group of enemies during a battle, but they always maintain a safe distance of at least 5 feet from any opponents. The weapons team will override its safety protocol whenever doing so allows them to hit two or more additional enemies. This strategy is also employed in moments of panic or when the team feels they have the upper hand.

##### Warpfire Thrower Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Self-Destruct Mechanism.** This upgrade perfectly aligns with ratfolk tactics. Whenever the situation becomes even slightly precarious, the team will activate the self-destruct mechanism and immediately abandon their post to avoid the ensuing explosion.

**Motorized Pumps.**  As the heat builds up and becomes unstoppable, the weapon becomes incredibly dangerous. Consequently, the ratfolk operating this weapon tend to be more reckless than other teams.

**Warp Napalm.** his weapon is best suited for a hit-and-run strategy. Ratfolk are more likely to utilize their Scurry Away feature with this weapon, forcing creatures that have failed their saving throws to decide between extinguishing the flames or using their Dash actions to chase after the weapons team. The team should prioritize setting as many creatures ablaze as possible rather than focusing on one particular group.

\columnbreak

### Warplock Jezzails
Crafted from a crude amalgamation of scavenged metal, timeworn wood, and luminescent crystals of chaotic energy mined from the deepest corners of the underworld, the warplock jezzail is a weapon of chilling potency. It is an exceptionally long, large-bore firearm, reinforced with metal bands and an elaborate shielding mechanism for the operator.

The ammunition it fires is nothing short of terrifying. Each bullet is a small shard of the same eerie crystal that powers the warplock jezzail, carrying a piece of raw, volatile energy within. When fired, these bullets blaze a path through the air, leaving an eerie, glowing trail before they impact with devastating force, capable of penetrating the thickest armor.

With its range and power, the warplock jezzail is an unmatched weapon of assassination and long-range warfare. The ratfolk snipers, perched high atop their subterranean cliffs or hidden in the labyrinthine tunnels, can lay low powerful adversaries from an immense distance, their presence often only revealed by the greenish streak of a successful kill.

However, the warplock jezzail is as dangerous to its operator as it is to its targets. The raw energy within the ammunition and the firearm itself is volatile and unstable. A jammed bullet, a malfunctioning firing mechanism, or simply overuse can lead to disastrous explosions, often fatally wounding the wielder and those around them.

> ***Fire (Leader Action).*** The leader fires the weapon at a target of its choice that it can see that's within 400 feet but more than 5 feet away. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 52 (8d12) piercing damage and 20 (8d4) radiant damage. The target gains advantage on this saving throw if the leader is within 5 feet of a hostile creature or if the leader moved during its last turn.

#### Warplock Jezzail Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warplock jezzail. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

**Rat-Eye Scopes.** At the end of the team leader's turn, if they have not moved, they can choose to take aim at a creature within 400 feet that they can see. The leader maintains its aim at the target until the leader moves, or the leader can no longer see the target, or the target moves more than 400 feet away from the team leader. While the leader maintains this aim, the target has disadvantage on saving throws against the weapon's Fire function.

**Sniper Jezzail.** A creature doesn't have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while part of the weapons team, and creatures on the weapons team can traverse or halt in a space large enough to accommodate an object one size smaller than themselves without squeezing. Additionally, using the weapon doesn't reveal the weapons team's position to other creatures they are more than 30 feet away from.

**Embedding Rounds.** When a creature fails a saving throw against the weapon's Fire ability, the bullet embeds in the target for one minute. While embedded, the creature cannot regain hit points, and at the end of each of its turns, it takes 10 (3d6) radiant damage.

\columnbreak

 The target creature or another creature within 5 feet can use an action to make a DC Wisdom (Medicine) check, attempting to extract the bullet. The target creature has disadvantage on this check if it attempts to remove the bullet from itself. On a successful check, the bullet is removed; however, on a failed check, the creature suffers 10 (3d6) radiant damage.

#### Warplock Jezzail Tactics
These weapons teams serve as snipers and prioritize targeting enemies with high armor and low dexterity. They swiftly retreat when confronted in melee combat.

#### Warplock Jezzail Upgrade Tactics 
&emsp;**Rat-Eye Scopes.** This upgrade enhances the warplock jezzail's sniping capabilities. The weapons team must be defended by other creatures to make effective use of this upgrade. If the team isn't near death, their weapon remains operational, and their target is still within range and appears vulnerable, they will continue firing despite sources of disadvantage. 

**Sniper Jezzail.** This upgrade allows the warplock jezzail to carry out ambushes in places where other weapons can't. If the team uses the Scurry Away feature, they'll take their time to run until they can become hidden again before resuming fire.

**Embedding Rounds.** While the team will still prioritize hitting low-dexterity targets, with this upgrade, they will focus on isolated targets that are unable to receive assistance in removing the bullets.

### Two-Creature Weapon Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these weapons are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Two-Creature Weapon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

The Basic Weapon Loot Table should be used for the standard version of any of the two-creature weapons in this document. The Advanced Weapon Table should be used for the more powerful variant of any of the weapons.

#### Example Two-Creature Weapon Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.

### Ratfolk Weapons Operator Tactics

Ratfolk weapons operators embody the typical behavior of other ratfolk but are emboldened by their high-powered weaponry. When they have the upper hand, they can be unrelenting bullies, acting recklessly due to their perceived omnipotence, which often leads to their downfall. Conversely, when overpowered or outmatched, panic tends to trigger reckless and drastic decisions, usually resulting in their own demise and potentially that of their foes as well.

Their tactics will vary depending on the weapon they are wielding, but there are some general guidelines:
* When using Scurry Away, ratfolk have the option to either abandon their post by dropping their weapon and fleeing or carry out a panicked job, which involves a hasty attempt at either repairing or firing the weapon again.
* If both ratfolk on the weapons team are wounded and cornered, they will choose to do a panicked job, retreating while desperately attempting to fix or fire the weapon. A frantic weapons team might take whatever risks necessary to maximize the damage potential of their weapon, often to comedic effect.
* If one of the team members has fallen, or if the weapon is damaged (it has less than half its hit points left), the team will likely abandon its post.
* Ratfolk with the optional Panicked Driver trait will abandon their vehicles as soon as they become immobile.

Much of the weaponry and vehicles available to ratfolk present options for high-risk, high-reward tactics. Ratfolk typically take greater risks under two conditions:
* When they are desperate, such as when they are cornered or near death.
* When they have gained the upper hand, they often get overzealous and strive for maximum power, even when it appears unnecessary. 

However, they generally avoid taking risks when the outcome of a fight seems uncertain.

#### Ratfolk Veteran Weapon Operators
Ratfolk veteran weapon operators have survived numerous weapon malfunctions and developed quick reflexes. Their survival is largely due to these reflexes rather than any specific tactical or technical knowledge. This means they generally behave similarly to standard weapon operators.

### Weapon Operator Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk weapon operators is identifying which materials they're carrying that still have functional value.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. If the identifying value materials the ratfolk was carrying will likely require an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check or a check using proficiency with appropriate tools, such as Smith's Tools, Tinker's Tools, or Alchemist's Supplies.


#### Weapon Operator Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
