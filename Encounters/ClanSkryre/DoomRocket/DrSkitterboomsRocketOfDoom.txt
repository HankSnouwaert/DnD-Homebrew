## Dr. Skitterboom's <br>Rocket of Doom <br> (Player Level: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players delve into the lair of a mad ratfolk scientist who's about to launch an arcane rocket capable of untold destruction. The players must overcome the ratfolk and his minions to disable the rocket before its launch countdown reaches zero. 


### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players know about Skitterboom's plans and have made their way to his lair to stop his rocket from launching. This encounter makes for a good finale to a dungeon where the players make their way through his hideout to reach the chamber where the rocket is being launched.


### Lead Up
There is only one entrance into the chamber, and there is no cover for the players to hide behind to try to enter stealthily without the aid of magic. As soon as the ratfolk realize the players have arrived, they will rush to launch the rocket earlier than planned, and the first one able to reach the rocket's control panel with its movement will do so and use an action to start the launch sequence. 

### Map Description
* **The Rocket.** The rocket has an AC 21 and 250 HP. The rocket launches 5 rounds after the launch sequence is activated. Once it launches, it travels at a speed of 300 ft. per round along the rails and through the tunnel off the right side of the map before eventually leaving the lair and flying toward its target. It is a magical object and ignores all magical barriers when it launches.<br>
If the rocket detonates, every creature within 500 feet of it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 radiant damage and 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a success.

* **The Control Panel** Any ratfolk within 5 feet of the control panel can use an action to activate the rocket's launch sequence, which will cause it to launch 5 rounds later. Creatures within 5 feet of the control panel can use an action to attempt to abort the launch sequence by making a DC 16 Intelligence (Tinker's Tools) check. Players who have made this check once before (pass or fail) have advantage on it. <br>
If the launch is aborted, it can be started again using the control panel, though the sequence will start over and take another 5 rounds.<br>
A creature can rush to attempt the use the control panel as a bonus action. When making the skill check while rushing, the creature must roll a d6. On a result of 1 or 2, the rocket's launch will be aborted, but it will also begin a self-destruct sequence and detonate after 1 minute.

<Br>


* **The Power Core.** The rocket's power core is a metallic orb of an unknown substance and provides the energy that activates its thrusters and is the source of its explosive power. It is a Small object with AC 12 and 30 hit points, and any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of it while it is not in the rocket takes 2d6 (7) radiant damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, or the rocket is reduced to 0 hit points while the power core is embedded in it, the power core begins collapsing in on itself and will detonate after 1 minute creating the same effect as the rocket's detonation.<Br>
The power core sits atop the rocket, embedded in its chassis, and a creature able to reach it can make a DC 16 Strength check to attempt to pull it out. Alternatively, a creature holding it can use an action to lock it back into the rocket. If removed, any ongoing launch sequence is canceled and can't be started again until it is returned to the rocket.

**NOTE:** Can the launch sequence be activated if the rocket's destruct sequence is going? Can the self destruct be aborted?


### Running the Encounter
When the battle starts, it should be made clear to the players that the control panel activated the rocket's launch and seems to control its operation. The power core also gives off an eerie glow that will be obvious to the players and potentially clue them to its importance. The players should also be aware of how much time there is to the rocket's launch, either via a dramatic automated voice doing the countdown or a launch clock ticking down.

The ratfolk will fight using most of the general tactics described later in this document. Skitterboom will target creatures that seem most likely to disable the rocket with his heavy firepower. The bombardiers will do their best to make approaching the rocket difficult, using poison gas clouds to make movement hazardous, and the infantry will try to body-block players. 

### Aftermath
If the players flee the lair, the ratfolk won't pursue them and will focus on ensuring the launch continues unless the rocket has been rendered inoperable or the power core is about to self-destruct and is still in the lair, in which case, the ratfolk will pursue the players.

The ratfolk won't flee unless it is clear they can't achieve a launch and are losing the battle.


#### Loot
After the battle, the players will be able to loot Skitterboom's chamber for all its valuable materials. Because this battle is likely to be the final encounter of an adventure, it would be a good time to award the players one or two treasure hoards of the appropriate level.

#### XP Award: 13,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players stop the rocket launch and slay or capture Skitterboom.
* **100% XP:** The players stop the rocket launch, but Skitterboom escapes. 
* **50% XP:** The players fail to stop the rocket launch but manage to slay or capture Skitterboom.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without stopping the rocket or slaying Skitterboom.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 7-9).** Replace the death globe bombardiers with poisoned wind globadiers and the storm vermin with clan rants. Change the XP award to 6,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 15-17).** Change Skitterdoom to a warlock master and give him a Brass Orb in addtion to his existing weapons. Give the death globe bombardiers the Acid Blast upgrade. Change the XP award to 22,000 XP.

# Encounter Reference Material

##  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.



### Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

#### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

#### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

#### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.



#### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

\columnbreak

#### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

##### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.



##### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

##### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

#### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

#### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

### Warp Lightning Cannon Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warp lightning cannon. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.

* **Warp Conduit.** When a creature makes a saving throw against the cannon's Fire function due to being in the area of its lightning, all other creatures within 5 feet of that creature must also make the saving throw against the effect as the electricity arcs between them. This arcing causes the original creature, and everyone the lightning arced to, to suffer disadvantage on their saving throws.
* **Regenerating Radiation.** When a creature preps or loads the cannon, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, it gains a level of exhaustion and regains 15 hit points. A creature immune to exhaustion cannot gain hit points this way.
* **Warpstone Dynamos.** The cannon no longer experiences mishaps when rolling for the length of its lightning blast. Instead, when the cannon rolls for the length of the line, it gains a charge for each 4 rolled on a d4 that lasts one minute. The cannon deals an additional 4 (1d8) damage per charge it has. However, if the weapon ever gains 4 or more charges, it suffers the Energy Overload Mishap. This mishap causes the cannon to take 71 (8d8) + 35 lightning damage and lose all its charges. If reduced to 0 hit points this way, the cannon experiences the Meltdown mishap.

### Warp Lightning Cannon Tactics

The warp lightning cannon serves as a powerful piece of artillery. Unlike many other artillery pieces, it fires in a straight line, which means that allied troops in front of it must clear a path for its lightning blast. Alternatively, the crew can choose to fire through expendable allies to reach prime enemy targets. Bogging down foes in such allies can be an effective way to ensure they can't escape the cannon's blasts.

#### Warp Lightning Cannon Upgrade Tactics

**Warp Conduit.** This upgrade is particularly useful when there are many expendable units on the front line. These additional bodies can be utilized to impose disadvantage on enemies' saving throws by triggering the arcing lightning effect.

**Regenerating Radiation.** This upgrade works best with expendable, less capable creatures working the cannon, as it keeps them alive but limits their combat effectiveness. However, its usefulness diminishes when the crew is more proficient in combat, as engaging with foes directly can be used as a last resort if the cannon becomes inoperable for some reason.

**Warpstone Dynamos.** This upgrade turns the weapon into a truly chaotic device. The predictability of its operations can be drastically reduced, leading to unforeseen outcomes on the battlefield.

### Warp Lightning Cannon Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these weapons are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Warp Lightning Cannon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Ratfolk Loot Guide
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying what goods are truly valuable items, not just trinkets they were trying to pretend were impressive status symbols.

### Lootable Ratfolk Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Ratfolk Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Weapon Operator Items |  Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence Check With Appropriate Tools |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. As ratfolk are quick to horde anything they might see as valuable, the difficulty in looting ratfolk often stems from sorting out actual valuables from items that have simply been made to appear valuable. 

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, a Monstrous Bone may be worth 10gp, but a Pristine Monstrous Bone would be worth 20gp, and a Cracked Monstrous Bone would be worth 5gp. Gems may be flawed, hide might be tattered, and metal corroded, cutting their value in half, and any item in pristine condition can be worth twice as much. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort.


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Bone | Gem | Hide | Metal |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1gp |  Rat Bone |  Green Quartz  | Leather Scraps | Blade Fragment |
|  10gp| Monstrous Bone |  Warp Stone  | Armored Leather | Intact Blade |
|  100gp| Trophy Bone |  Warp Gem  | Trophy Hide | Warp-Steel Fragment |
|  1,000gp| Eldritch Horn |  Warp Jewel  | Warp Leather| Warp-Steel Blade |

### Ratfolk Tactics
Ratfolk rarely have the advantage over their foes in terms of individual power and must instead rely upon cunning and numbers. Grand strategic goals are pursued using deception, betrayal, and securing large numbers of allies. Ratfolk are opportunistic schemers by nature and can flip from cowering hesitation to brutal aggression the moment they see an opening to pursue their goals. Though ratfolk are quick to backstab one another to pursue their ends, they naturally unite into overwhelming verminous mobs when faced with an outside threat. These tactics carry over into how ratfolk engage the players in combat.




#### Engagement
Ratfolk rarely engage enemies on anything approaching even footing. They don’t start a fight unless they’ve caught the players off-guard, have overwhelming numbers, or have a terrain advantage. If they’re able, ratfolk will surround the players before making their presence known using their natural stealthiness. They will also try to fight in dark and claustrophobic environments where their darkvision and Crevice Crawler abilities allow them to sneak up from unexpected directions.


#### Combat

So long as they believe they have the upper hand, ratfolk are vicious combatants to the point of recklessness. They will dogpile an isolated or otherwise vulnerable opponent and utilize their Overwhelming Mass feature to rack up brutal amounts of damage. If the players manage to regroup to support whoever is being ganged up on, the ratfolk will scatter using their Scurry Away feature before rallying to reattempt the same tactic. Fighting in an environment with tight spaces the players can’t easily move through helps facilitate this fighting style.


#### Retreat
Ratfolk aren’t shy about retreating if a fight doesn’t appear to be going well. If ratfolk force as a whole is doing well, individual ratfolk will often fight to the death. However, their morale plummets once they no longer perceive themselves as having the upper hand. This may happen if the ratfolk lose more than half their fighting force or their leader is slain, and their enemies don’t appear to be near defeat. Under these circumstances, most ratfolk will flee if they have lost at least half their health, face a foe they don’t outnumber, or see multiple nearby allies flee.


#### Tactics: Council Guards
These are the most elite ratfolk soldiers and most atypical of their kind in terms of their combat behavior. Their primary goal is to safeguard their commander, and their Scurry Towards feature lets them intercept players trying to chase down said commander. Council guards will also never flee a fight if doing so would put the commander in jeopardy.

#### Tactics: Weapon Operators

Ratfolk weapons operators embody the typical behavior of other ratfolk but are emboldened by their high-powered weaponry. When they have the upper hand, they can be unrelenting bullies, acting recklessly due to their perceived omnipotence, which often leads to their downfall. Conversely, when overpowered or outmatched, panic tends to trigger reckless and drastic decisions, usually resulting in their own demise and potentially that of their foes as well.

Their tactics will vary depending on the weapon they are wielding, but there are some general guidelines:
* When using Scurry Away, ratfolk have the option to either abandon their post by dropping their weapon and fleeing or carry out a panicked job, which involves a hasty attempt at either repairing or firing the weapon again.
* If both ratfolk on the weapons team are wounded and cornered, they will choose to do a panicked job, retreating while desperately attempting to fix or fire the weapon. A frantic weapons team might take whatever risks necessary to maximize the damage potential of their weapon, often to comedic effect.
* If one of the team members has fallen, or if the weapon is damaged (it has less than half its hit points left), the team will likely abandon its post.
* Ratfolk with the optional Panicked Driver trait will abandon their vehicles as soon as they become immobile.

Much of the weaponry and vehicles available to ratfolk present options for high-risk, high-reward tactics. Ratfolk typically take greater risks under two conditions:
* When they are desperate, such as when they are cornered or near death.
* When they have gained the upper hand, they often get overzealous and strive for maximum power, even when it appears unnecessary. 

However, they generally avoid taking risks when the outcome of a fight seems uncertain.

##### Ratfolk Veteran Weapon Operators
Ratfolk veteran weapon operators have survived numerous weapon malfunctions and developed quick reflexes. Their survival is largely due to these reflexes rather than any specific tactical or technical knowledge. This means they generally behave similarly to standard weapon operators.
