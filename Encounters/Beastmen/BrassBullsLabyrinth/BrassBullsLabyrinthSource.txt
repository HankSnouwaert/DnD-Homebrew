## The Brass Bull's Labyrinth <br> (Player Level: 15-17)
In this encounter, the players must navigate a labyrinth inhabited by savage minotaurs and bloodthirsty demons so they can confront the dread minotaur known as The Brass Bull.


### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as a standalone mini-dungeon or as part of a much larger dungeon crawl. All that is needed for context is that the players have a reason to reach the end of the maze, either to specifically slay The Brass Bull or to retrieve something he is guarding.

### Labyrinth Encounters
The labyrinth map features several groups of monsters scattered across various locations. Though, in the setting, the monsters may be wandering throughout the labyrinth, for the purposes of running the game, you can treat them as though they are in these static locations and have them "find" the players whenever the party comes too close.

**Starting an Encounter.**  Whenever the players reach a location on the map marked with "Encounter Start," there's the potential for them to come into contact with the creatures there. As all the monsters in the labyrinth are actively being stealthy, have the creatures associated with that encounter make Dexterity (Stealth) checks against the players' passive Perception. If the players are attempting to move stealthily, you can do the same for the players. If one side notices the other without being noticed, they can surprise their opponents in combat.

If the players make an excessive amount of noise near one of the encounter locations, you may also opt to have the monsters there strike out and hunt down the players.

**Ending Encounters.** The labyrinth's monsters want nothing more than to slay and devour the players. Once they detect the players, they will pursue them until they've hunted down their quarry. If a group of monsters is badly losing a fight, it may opt to retreat and later ambush the players when they least suspect it.


### Labyrinth Loot
The locations marked with 'L' on the map contain spare loot the players can discover. This should generally come in the form of a consumable magic item or wealth. For example, each location could contain 1d6 1,000gp gems and a magic item from Magic Item Table C of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The final encounter could also contain a larger portion of an entire treasure hoard. You can adjust the value of this loot based on the difficulty level of the labyrinth.

### Running The Maze Without A Map
If you're playing using theater of the mind and do not wish to describe every turn and hallway in the labyrinth, you can instead have them make six different Wisdom (Survival) checks to attempt to reach the final chamber. For each check they pass, they choose the correct path and avoid an encounter. Every time they fail a check, they take a wrong turn, which leads them into an encounter.

### Minotaur Tactics
Below are some tips for running the minotaurs in the labyrinth.
#### Common Traits
* Formidable melee fighters.
* Lower health but higher damage output.
* Possess Blood Greed trait, increasing damage and appetite for flesh.
* After a kill, they may gorge on the prey rather than pursue other nearby enemies.

#### Minotaur Combat Style
* Favors a full gore attack, knocking targets back 10 feet.
* Typically backs up to charge again, unless blood greed is active.
* When blood greed is active, uses a greataxe or charges at an accessible enemy, risking opportunity attacks.

#### Minotaur Butcher
* Higher defense than regular Minotaurs.
* Blood Greed activation enhances Hewing Cleaver attack and triggers Blood Regeneration for better survivability.

#### Gorebull
* Capable of making two attacks per turn; first a gore to knock a target prone, then a greataxe attack with advantage.
* Can charge at two different targets if able.
* While under the effects of Blood Greed, prefers two Hewing Greataxe attacks for increased damage.
* Uses Slaughterer’s Call before combat to rally minotaurs and gain tactical advantage.

#### Doombull
* Begins combat by charging to knock a target prone.
* Follows up with Barbed Fist to inflict wounds that can be exploited by fellow minotaurs.
* Coordinates attacks to keep the target prone, maximizing damage with Hewing Greataxe.
* Prioritizes reapplying wounds to maintain tactical advantage if the target recovers.

### Juggernaut Tactics
Juggernauts serve as shock cavalry, often mounted by bloodletters. In combat, a juggernaut charges targets to knock them prone and stomp them. It will then stay in melee range to keep its prey from fleeing without risking an opportunity attack. At the start of its next turn, if the juggernaut has 30 or more hit points, it will back up and charge the target again.




#### Searing Juggernauts
Searing juggernauts prefer to engage groups of enemies, maximizing the impact of their Mantle of Immolation. They are most effective when paired with creatures that deal fire damage. Since the Mantle of Immolation can be triggered once per turn, a searing juggernaut can activate this ability on its own turn with its Gore or Pulverizing Stomp attacks and on the enemies turn if the creature ends it's in the juggernaut aura.  

\columnbreak


#### Rage Riders
Bloodrenders typically ride juggernauts, which can knock their prey prone. As such, the juggernaut should attack first so the bloodrender can gain advantage against the prone target. Additionally, remember that the juggernaut is a demon of rage, allowing it to contribute to the Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide abilities.



### The Brass Bull Tactics

#### General Tactics
* **Dealing With Weak Point:** Prioritizes targets that consistently hit him with advantage, especially those resistant to his Dread Presence.
* **Block Reaction:** Reserves his reaction for the Block ability, using it against the attack likely to inflict the most damage.

#### Legendary Actions Usage
* **Building Fury:** Focuses on accumulating stacks of rampage whenever possible.
* **Blood Call:** Summons distant enemies closer for melee engagement.
* **Vent Heat:** Used when three or more targets can be hit simultaneously.

#### Cataclysmic Onslaught Tactics
* **1st Turn (Horrific Onslaught):** Targets those frightened by its dread presence to maximize rampage benefits, deviating from usual targets.
* **2nd Turn (Eldritch Onslaught):** Targets the creature furthest from its allies, limiting their ability to assist.
* **3rd Turn and Beyond:** Continues usual tactics, unaffected by the specific abilities used in previous onslaught turns.

### XP Award
Because the goal of the labyrinth is to reach its end rather than clear it of enemies, you may opt not to award XP for players defeating groups of enemies because they took wrong turns. When the players reach the end of the labyrinth and defeat the chieftain, you can award them an extra XP determined by the difficulty of the labyrinth in addition to normal XP from defeating the monsters.

## Minotaur Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them. You may apply these mutations to creatures who don't have the beastman creature type, but some of the effects may require the creature to have the Primal Fury, Blood Greed or Charge abilities.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

### Gnarled Hide

*The beastman's hide has toughed up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The beastman gets +2 to its AC.

### Goregreed (Requires Blood Greed)

*The beastman's hunger for flesh can not be stated; the more blood it tastes, the greater it hungers.*

When the beastman's Blood Greed trait activates, it gets +2 to attack rolls. This ability can stack up to three times. It loses all stacks if it ends its turn without activating Blood Greed.


### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Beastman's Gore attack deals extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage in addition to it's normal damage if it moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit.

### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury or Blood Greed ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

>
> ***Weak Point.*** Whenever a creature has advantage on an attack roll against the Brass Bull, it can choose to roll only one die instead of two as it aims for the Brass Bull's weak point. If the attack hits, the Brass Bull has vulnerability to the damage from the attack. The attack still counts as having advantage for the purposes of other abilities such as a rogue's Sneak Attack. If any damage would reduce the Brass Bull to 0 hit points that did not target its weak point, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead. The Brass Bull only dies if reduced to 0 hit points from damage dealt to its weak point.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The Brass Bull uses its Dread Presence and makes two attacks with its Rune-Tortured Axe.
>
> ***Charge.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* The target takes an extra 4 (1d8) piercing damage for each 10 feet the Brass Bull moved in a straight line before the attack.
>
> ***Crushing Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 6) piercing damage, the target takes an extra 4 (1d8) piercing damage for each 10 feet the Brass Bull moved in a straight line before the attack. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone. If the target fails by 10 or more, the creature is dazed until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Dread Presence.*** Each creature of the Brass Bull's choice that is within 120 feet of it and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature can't cast spells other than cantrips. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the Brass Bull's Dread Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Rune-Tortured Axe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage, plus 3 (1d6) fire damage for each level of rampage the Brass Bull has.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The Brass Bull can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Brass Bull regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Check.** The Brass Bull makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Blood Call.** The Brass Bull chooses a creature that just took its turn, which it can see within 120 feet of it, calling it into battle by having the creature's own blood turn on it. At the start of the creature's next turn, the target may move on its turn toward the Brass Bull by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet of it. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal, except it can't move away from the Brass Bull willingly and can't teleport. If it doesn't choose to move this way, it takes 22 (4d10) force damage.
>
> **Building Fury.** The Brass Bull moves up to half its movement then makes a Rune-Tortured Axe attack against a creature that just took its turn. If the attack hits and deals damage, the Brass Bull gains a level of rampage, up to a maximum of ten levels. Each level increases the Brass Bull's speed by 5 feet. All levels of rampage are lost after one minute of not gaining a level.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If the Brass Bull is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its turn, it may immediately make that saving throw with advantage. It can use this legendary action even while incapacitated.
>
> **Vent Heat (Costs 2 Actions).** The Brass Bull burns the air around it, forcing each creature within 10 feet of it to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) fire damage and has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not suffer disadvantage on its next attack.
>
> ### Reaction
>
> ***Block.*** The Brass Bull adds +6 to its AC against one attack that would hit it. To use this reaction, the Brass Bull must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.

### Epic Battle: Cataclysmic Onslaught
If you wish to turn the Brass Bull into an endgame threat, increase his Hit Points to 600 and give him the Cataclysmic Onslaught ability described below. These changes increase his Challenge Rating (CR) to 23.

### Cataclysmic Onslaught

When the Brass Bull rolls initiative, he can activate his Cataclysmic Onslaught. On initiative count 1 of each round during combat, he gains a new ability for the next minute on each following turn:

#### 1st Turn: Horrific Onslaught

The Brass Bull has advantage on attack rolls against creatures that are frightened of him.

#### 2nd Turn: Eldritch Onslaught

At the start of his turn, the Brass Bull chooses one creature within 150 feet of him that he is aware of. The chosen creature is engulfed in an agonizing inferno, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage and is set on fire for one minute. The burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. The target cannot benefit from being invisible and has disadvantage on attack rolls. A creature can use its action to douse the fire by making a DC 16 Dexterity check. The flames are also extinguished if the creature is fully submerged in water or standing in an area with strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour). At the end of each of its turns while on fire, the creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage, and the Brass Bull gains a level of rampage.

#### 3rd Turn: Unyielding Onslaught

Spells and other magical effects can neither reduce his speed nor cause him to be paralyzed or restrained, and he can spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has him grappled. Additionally, being underwater imposes no penalties on his movement or attacks.

#### 4th Turn: Bloodthirsty Onslaught

The Brass Bull has advantage on melee attack rolls against any creature that does not have all its hit points.

\columnbreak

### The Brass Bull's Lair
The Brass Bull does not maintain a traditional lair or remain in one location for an extended period. Instead, he roams the land, selecting locations to wreak havoc upon—often choosing relatively isolated villages or farmlands near woods for his temporary lairs. From these bases, he methodically spreads terror among the nearby inhabitants.

When fighting within his lair, the Brass Bull's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 1.

#### Lair Actions
When the Brass Bull rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or the Brass Bull dies, the lair has an Intelligence 6 and can act of its own accord but always acts in the Brass Bull's best interest. While active this way, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

**Tide of Blood.** A wave of blood crashes down on an area within the lair, up to 30 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. If the Brass Bull is within the area of the wave, he takes no damage and instead regains 13 (3d8) hit points. If the wave passes through the space of three or more creatures, the Brass Bull gains a level of rampage.

**Seeping Wounds.** Wounded creatures within the lair begin to bleed profusely. Each creature with half or less of its hit points must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. Creatures at 0 hit points automatically fail this saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If two or more creatures fail this saving throw, the Brass Bull gains a level of rampage.

#### Regional Effects
The presence of the Brass Bull drastically affects his surroundings, bringing ruin and bloodshed that warp the land within 5 miles of his lair:

* Rivers in the area run red with blood.
* Corpses and other remains are preserved from decay and cannot become undead.
* Non-minotaur creatures within the area require three times the usual amount of rations per day. Additionally, any creature can consume raw meat without risk of sickness.
* Minotaurs in the area gain advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to track or smell creatures that have lost more than half their hit points.

These effects gradually dissipate over 1d10 days after the Brass Bull's death.

### Minotaur Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from minotaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Minotaur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Megataur Loot
The valuable items looted from rat ogres will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### Bloodrender Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### The Brass Bull Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the Brass Bull consist of what can be harvested from his demonically blessed form. Because his hide and flesh are metallic in nature, it's up to you what qualities you want to assign it and how the players harvest it. For example, you could have players make an **Intelligence (Smith's Tools)** or **Intelligence (Leatherworker's Tools)** to collect his hide. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

You may also opt to simply have the players collect weapons and equipment he was carrying or wearing.

#### The Brass Bull Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
