## Omen of Doom <br> (Player Level: 15-17)
In this encounter, the players enter the ruins of a desecrated church and face off against the sinister beastman shaman known as The Dark Omen.

### Encounter Context
This encounter is likely the final battle of an adventure (or even a campaign), in which case, the players have come to put an end to The Dark Omen once and for all. Alternatively, this could be their first encounter with him, and even if he is slain, he may have a means of regenerating to terrorize the players again until they find a way to defeat him permanently. 

### Lead Up
The encounter assumes the players know there is danger within the crumbling church and probably shouldn't stumble into it unprepared. They may have the opportunity to try to sneak in, or The Dark Omen may be aware of their presence as they draw near.

The players should enter the second level of the ruined church through the staircase in the bottom right corner of the map. The Dark Omen will be hidden in the tree branches, perched 30 feet above the second floor and watching for the players as they enter. Once they reach the center staircase or go beyond it towards the defiled shrine at the top of the map, he will strike.

### Map Description
* **Animated Vine Pits.** The floor has collapsed in some areas, revealing a lower level, 30 feet below the second story where the players start, now covered in deadly animated vines. Any creature that ends its turn in the vines takes 4d6 piercing damage as the vines lash at it. The area is also difficult terrain. Beastmen ignore the effects of the vines.
* **Trees.** The trees have varying heights and can be climbed with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. 
* **The Church.** The church's ceiling has caved in, giving The Dark Omen free range in terms of how high he can fly.

### The Besthorn Minions
Once combat starts, on initiative count 20 of every turn (losing ties), a besthorn will appear at one of the random numbered locations shown on the map. All the besthorns that have joined the fight this way take their turns one after another. Players with a passive Perception of 15 or higher will be able to detect which entrance a besthorn will appear at the round beforehand.

If The Dark Omen dies, all other beastmen in the encounter lose their Primal Fury, if it is currently active, and become frightened of the players as they attempt to flee the church.

<br>

#### Besthorn Tactics

&emsp;**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

**Besthorn Manrippers.** If you're running the harder version of the encounter, the besthorns will be replaced with the more powerful manrippers. These beastmen prioritize attacking targets with low Strength so they can best utilize their Hewing Greataxe attacks. However, if the enemies they can reach all have high AC or abilities that make them hard to hit, the manrippers will change their strategy to attacking foes that are grouped up so they can attempt to make use of their Arcing Swing ability.

### The Dark Omen
The Dark Omen is a formidable spellcaster who is also adept in melee combat. He specializes in casting spells that are most effective at close range. Thanks to his fly speed, The Dark Omen excels in repositioning himself for optimal attacks and spellcasting.


#### Spells
The Dark Omen's primary ability is Unholy Frenzy, which enhances his spellcasting power as combat progresses. Creatures attempting to charm, frighten, or interfere with the Dark Omen's ability to make Wisdom checks become his primary targets. The Dark Omen is a tactical spellcaster and avoids using spells on targets likely to resist them.

##### Summon Flock
The Dark Omen can cast this spell at will and should always have it active so that he gains a +12 bonus to Perception, bringing his passive Perception up to 22. Attacks made with this spell also benefit from the Unholy Fury trait.

##### Withering Resolve
Cast this spell on creatures likely to interfere with The Dark Omen's Unholy Frenzy checks, particularly targets lacking proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

##### Bray Scream
* **Use Case 1:** Cast when it can affect more than two targets.
* **Use Case 2:** Cast if The Dark Omen is airborne and is confronted by another flying opponent with low Constitution.

##### Impending Doom 
Best cast on targets with low Charisma or on those already under the effects of Withering Resolve

##### Wind of Death
Effective when it can hit two or more targets

##### Horrifying Laughter vs. Pit of Shadows
* **Horrifying Laughter:** Preferable when targeting a creature whose saving throw has been lowered, especially if it's already affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*
* **Pit of Shadows:** Generally a better choice when it can affect two or more creatures with lower Dexterity, particularly if no target is affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*

##### Savage Dominion vs. Purple Sun
Both spells are extremely devastating, but their usage depends on specific conditions:

* **Purple Sun:** Cast this spell when Dark Omen has 100 or more hit points and is not suffering from any crippling conditions.
* **Savage Dominion:** Opt for this spell if Dark Omen's action economy is low or he anticipates defeat in the next round. The summoned creature persists even after Dark Omen's demise.

\columnbreak

##### Creatures Summoned With Savage Dominion
The preferred creature can depend on the state of the battle:
* **Giant:** Ideal for situations where adversaries excel in avoiding melee combat or are engaged in long-range fighting
* **Jabberwocky:** Ideal for disrupting enemies with its Burble ability and other debilitating effects. Note that the Burble ability can affect anyone in proximity, including The Dark Omen
* **Behemoth:** A versatile choice suited for targeting and consuming individual targets as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

#### Legendary Actions
When The Dark Omen is not in debilitating terrain and is surrounded by less than two enemies, it primarily uses its legendary actions to cast spells. If The Dark Omen finds itself in debilitating terrain or surrounded by two or more enemies, it will prioritize using its actions to reposition itself. When moving, The Dark Omen aims to move from one target. This strategic movement is designed to maximize the benefits of its Charge ability for its Gore attack at the end of its movement.


### Aftermath
How the encounter could end and what comes next mostly depends on the encounter's context. The Dark Omen could fight to the death if he knows he will come back to life or if this encounter represents his last stand against the players. Alternatively, he could try to flee if he knows he is losing the fight and has a long-term backup plan he wants to fall back on. 

If the players flee, The Dark Omen and his minions are well-equipped to pursue them wherever they go. This could potentially lead to a chase encounter. 

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables the beastmen leave behind. Because this is likely to be a major encounter, it could be a good time to award the players a full or partial treasure hoard (described in the DMG) that's appropriate to their level.

#### XP Award: 22,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating The Dark Omen can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeated The Dark Omen without taking much damage or allowing him to escape.
* **100% XP:** The players defeated The Dark Omen, but it was a close victory, or he managed to escape. 
* **50% XP:** The Dark Omen fled, but the players were too wounded/resource-depleted to pursue him, or vice versa.
* **10% XP:** The players fled with The Dark Omen fully capable of pursuing them.


\pagebreakNum

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 12-14).** Remove the besthorns from the encounter. Change the XP Award to 18,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Replace the besthorns with besthorn manrippers, and give The Dark Omen the following enhancements:

* Increase his hit points to 600
* Increase the AC granted by his natural armor to 17
* Give him proficiency in Strength and Dexterity saving throws (increasing his modifier to +8 for Strength and +7 for Dexterity)
* Increase his CR to 20 

Change the XP award to 45,000 XP.

### Adventure Tie-Ins
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Sacred Relics:** Prior to facing The Dark Omen in the desecrated church, the players are tasked with recovering sacred relics that were stolen from the church. These relics hold the key to weakening The Dark Omen's powers and cleansing the church. |
|  2  | **The Lost Congregation:** After the encounter, the players learn that the spirits of those who once worshipped at the church are restless and tormented by The Dark Omen's actions. The players embark on a quest to bring peace to these spirits, which involves delving into the church's history, confronting lingering evils, and performing a sacred rite to cleanse the site.|
|  3  | **The Crow's Prophecy:** The Dark Omen, though defeated, has set in motion a dire prophecy that continues to unfold. The players must decipher this prophecy, traveling to various locations foretold in its verses. Each location presents unique challenges and revelations about The Dark Omen's ultimate plan, leading to a final showdown to prevent the prophecy's catastrophic conclusion.|
|  4  |**The Desecration Ritual:** The players discover that The Dark Omen plans to use the desecrated church as a site for a dark ritual that will spread corruption throughout the forest and beyond. They must gather information on the ritual, seek out mystical allies, and disrupt the ritual's components before facing The Dark Omen in the church ruins.|

### Besthorn Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Besthorn Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### The Dark Omen's Lair

When fighting within his lair, The Dark Omen's CR increases by 1. For the purposes of this encounter, the ruined church is considered his lair.
#### Lair Actions

When fighting inside his lair, The Dark Omen can invoke the ambient magic that has saturated his temporary abode to use his lair action. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), The Dark Omen can cause the following effects, even while incapacitated:

Creatures without the Primal Fury or Unholy Fury abilities in the layer must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is overwhelmed by a sense of abject defeat until initiative count 20 on the next round. While overwhelmed this way, a creature can't add their proficiency bonus to saving throws, checks, attack rolls, or their spell save DC for spells they cast. If three or more creatures fail the saving, The Dark Omen gains a level of power for his Unholy Fury trait if the ability is active.

#### Regional Effects
Any region where The Dark Omen dwells for a significant amount of time is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of his lair:

* Strange footprints appear across the area, going up vertical surfaces, solid objects, and sometimes mysteriously disappearing with no trace. These footprints prevent The Dark Omen from being tracked except by magical means while in the area.
* Clouds in the sky form into leering horned skulls and other twisted faces.
* Beasts within the area become highly aggressive and agitated, causing creatures other than The Dark Omen to have disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks while in the area.
* Crows and carrion birds become predominant in the area and can telepathically communicate with The Dark Omen while he is in the area.

If Dark Omen dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

### The Dark Omen Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Dark Omen come from what can be harvested from his horns and wings or from relics and blasphemous icons he carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
