## The Beastpath Crossing <br> (Player Level: 5-7)
In this encounter, the players stumble upon a beastpath intersection deep in the woods, where they face off against waves of incoming beastmen attackers.

### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players have traveled deep enough into the woods to find the beastpath intersection. They may have been searching for it or found it by accident. In either case, there should be enough hoofprints and human remains strewn along the path to indicate it has been well-trodden by vicious creatures of the forest.

### Lead Up
The encounter begins whenever the players wander into the beastpaths. The incoming beastmen will already be aware that they are somewhere in this area. Depending on the level of perceptiveness among the players, they may be able to hear the beastmen coming.

### Map Description
* **Forest Foliage.** These areas are non-magical difficult terrain that provide cover and heavily obscure creatures within them.
* **Trees.** The trees have varying heights and can be climbed with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. 
* **Rock Cliffs.** These land features can be climbed with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

### Running the Encounter
At the start of the encounter, a group of beastmen will appear at a random entrance on the map. To determine what types of beastmen appear, roll on the beastmen mob table below. To determine where they appear, roll a d4 and match the result to the numbered entrance on the map. (If the result is a location already occupied by beastmen or the players, reroll.) Before the beastmen appear, you can have them make a Dexterity (Stealth) check to determine if they sneak up on the players.

After the beastmen mob appears, repeat this process to determine another beastmen mob that will appear 3 rounds later on initiative count 1. Have the new mob make a Dexterity (Stealth) check now to determine if the players will hear them coming in advance, in which case, the players will also know what entrance they are coming from.

Repeat this process until 3 randomly generated mobs have appeared. When the final mob appears, have it accompanied by the beastman "boss." For this encounter's default difficulty, it will be a **warhorn**.

#### Tips for Speeding Up Combat
If you find that beastmen's turns are taking too long, there are a few ways you can speed up the process.

* **Shared Initiative.** Have each beastmen mob that appears share the same initiative count, with all the creature's in the mob taking their turns back-to-back in any order you choose. This can save you a lot of time rolling for initiative.

*  **Use Damage Averages.** Whenever a beastman hits with an attack, you can skip the damage roll to just use the average damage listed on the statblock.

* **Use The Alternate Primal Fury Rules.** These alternate rules can be handy when running combat with large numbers of beastmen. They are described in the Managing Primal Fury At Scale section listed after the beastmen tactics later in the document.

##### Beastmen Mob Table: Player Level 5-7
| d4  | Loot |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | 6 Longhorns |
|  2  | 8 Shorthorns |
|  3  | 6 Shorthorn Raiders |
|  4  | 2 Besthorns |

 **Boss: 1 Warhorn**




### Aftermath
If the battle is clearly not going their way, the beastmen will retreat into the woods. Once they've recovered from any injuries, they may attempt to gather reinforcements to hunt down the players and exact their revenge. Or, if the players won an overwhelming victory, they may avoid another engagement.

If the players flee, the beastmen will give chase unless they are very wounded or their numbers are depleted. 

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables the beastmen leave behind. Because this is a random encounter in the wilderness and beastmen aren't known for carrying much of value, there isn't any need to include much loot beyond this. But, if you want to include a portion of a treasure hoard, you could have coins and other valuables strewn about the beast path left behind by previous victims of the traveling beastmen.

#### XP Award: 4,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the beastmen can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the beastmen without taking much damage or allowing any to escape.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the beastmen, but it was a close victory, or some of the beastmen escaped (either the boss or about one mob's worth). 
* **50% XP:** The players defeat most of the beastmen, but flee before winning the battle (either the boss or about one mob's worth of beastmen remain.)
* **10% XP:** The players flee with more than a mob's worth of beastmen remaining.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty by using different beastmen mob tables and changing the XP award accordingly.

### Beastmen Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

#### Crown of Horns 
*This creature is gifted with especially large and grandiose twisting horns, granting it extreme confidence, for it knows it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

When the beastman makes a Wisdom check caused by its Primal Fury ability, it automatically succeeds unless it has disadvantage on the roll.

#### Gnarled Hide

*The beastman's hide has toughed up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The beastman gets +2 to its AC.

#### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Beastman's charge deals extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage in addition to it's normal damage.

#### Many Limbed Monster

*The beastman sports an extra pair of clawed arms to tear at its enemies.*

When the beastman takes the attack action, it makes one additional attack as part of the action, which uses the attack modifier of its Gore attack. On hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage. (The attack also gains the benefits of Primal Fury.)

#### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

\columnbreak

<br>

#### Shadow Hide

*The beastman's black fur melds perfectly with the darkness around it, allowing it to stalk its prey from the shadows while completely unseen.*

While in darkness, the beastman is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness. Additionally, it does not suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks from wearing Armor.
Finally, it gains the Bestial Ambush ability as described below. If it already has a Bestial Ambush ability, the damage bonus of its Bestial Ambush is increased by 9 (2d8).

***Bestial Ambush.*** When the beastman takes the Attack action for the first time each combat, its walking speed increases by 20 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If it hits with an attack during that turn that has advantage, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage.

#### Slug-Skin

*This beastman's disgusting skin oozes thick, slippery, toxic slime.*

At the end of the beastman's turn, any ground within 5 feet of it is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Creatures standing in the area have disadvantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, and prone creatures in the area must spend all their movement to stand up instead of half. If a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. 

Creatures with Primal Fury trait ignore the effects of the slime (regardless of whether their Primal Fury is active or not). A gallon or more of water moving more than 5 miles per hour will wash the slime away from a 5-foot square area.

#### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Shorthorn Tactics
These beastmen are weak and cowardly by nature and will usually only press an attack if they feel they have an advantage that tips the odds in their favor. This advantage could range from a surprise attack to overwhelming numbers or the use of forested terrain to launch hit-and-run attacks. Once they feel they're on the winning side, shorthorns will charge in with the same reckless ferocity common to most beastmen.

##### Shorthorn Tormentors
These beastmen typically move ahead of the rest of their warband, setting up ambushes that their allies can capitalize on. If they can pull off the ambush, they'll use their poisonous attacks to weaken players and leave them more susceptible to the charges of other beastmen. Once an enemy is prone, the tormentors will surround it and ensure it can't get back up. These tactics make tormentors ideal allies for stronger beastmen like longhorns and besthorns.

##### Shorthorn Raiders and Stalkers
These beastmen are unique in that they avoid rushing into battle to use their Charge ability. Instead, they specialize in targeting foes their allies can't reach in close combat. They are skillful and opportunistic archers and will take cover between their attacks whenever possible.

\columnbreak

<br>

#### Longhorn Tactics
Longhorns make up the bulk of most beastmen warherds. When fighting together, they form a rowdy mob drunk on their confidence and recklessly charging into enemies. If the fight doesn't quickly go in their favor, sobering reality may set in, causing them to break and flee if they don't have a leader keeping them in line.

##### Longhorn Ravagers
These beastmen's signature ability is Swig. They will typically expend a use of the ability just before combat, letting the poisoned condition clear while retaining the temporary hit points. 

In the heat of battle, they will use the Swig ability again if they lose their Primal Fury or they drop below half health. It's important that they use Swig after they've made their attacks for the turn so they can minimize the disadvantage from being poisoned.

Because of their drunken nature, these beastmen will be even more wild and reckless than the rest of their kin, and you can reflect this by having them take more foolhardy actions in combat.

#### Besthorns
Because these elite warriors wear heavy armor, they often can't rely on stealth and ambush tactics unless they have cover from heavy vegetation. If they're unlikely to successfully sneak up on players, but they're teamed up with other beastmen who can, the besthorns will charge the players head-on. This will allow the sneakier beastmen an opportunity to move around and attack from behind while the players are distracted.

##### Besthorn Manrippers
These beastmen prioritize attacking targets with low Strength so they can best utilize their Hewing Greataxe attacks. However, if the enemies they can reach all have high AC or abilities that make them hard to hit, the manrippers will change their strategy to attacking foes that are grouped up so they can attempt to make use of their Arcing Swing ability.

#### Warhorns and Beastlords
These beastmen leaders fight from within the center of their minions, extending their aura to as many beastmen as possible. Because they're constantly seeking the favor of their dark gods, they will often challenge the most powerful adversaries they can find to prove their worth.

Because of their armor, their ambush options are often limited, and so they typically use the same combat initiation tactics as besthorns.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
