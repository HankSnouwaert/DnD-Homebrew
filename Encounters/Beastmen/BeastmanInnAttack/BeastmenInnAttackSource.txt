## The Inn Raid <br> (Player Level: 5-7)
In this encounter, the players help villagers fend off a beastman raid from within a woodland inn where they've taken shelter.

### Encounter Context
There are many ways this encounter can be set up. The players could have come to this inn seeking shelter from the perils outside as nightfall nears, they may have been sent on a mission to protect the people here from the recent threat of the beastmen, or they may be stopping here for the night, completely unaware that anything is amiss until they speak with the people here.

### Lead Up
When the players arrive at the inn, they are quickly ushered inside by the local militia. They are told by the people there that beastmen have begun raiding the countryside with increased frequency, forcing them to bunker within the inn for safety each night. There are 8 local militia fighters and 20 unarmed commoners remaining within the inn. 

An hour after the party arrives, the beastmen launch an attack against the inn. The attack consists of four groups of beastmen, each appearing one at a time, one round after the next. Each group appears at a different location on the map in any order you wish and attacks the inn from that side. 

Each group will attempt to approach the inn stealthily and climb up the side of the inn to break into the upstairs before attacking. If a group is spotted before this, it will attempt to break in and attack the nearest target possible, prioritizing armed combatants. 


### Map Description
* **Forest Foliage.** These areas are non-magical difficult terrain that provide cover and heavily obscure creatures within them.
* **Trees.** The trees have varying heights and can be climbed with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. 
* **Steep Hills.** These hills are difficult terrain for any creature without a climb speed.
* **Inn Walls.** The inn contains two stories, each of which is about 10 feet high. The exterior walls can be climbed with a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. 
* **Inn Doors.** The doors each have 20 hit points and a 15 AC and can be forced open with a DC 16 Strength check.
* **Inn Windows.** The windows are barred, and creatures can fire through them as long as they are within 5 feet of the window when they do so. Otherwise, the window provides three-quarters cover to creatures being targeted by ranged attacks and prevents most melee attacks. Each window's bars have 20 hit points and a 15 AC and can be forced open with a DC 16 Strength check
* **Furniture & Object Clutter.** Some cluttered areas of the inn count as difficult terrain.

### The Militia
The militia will do their best to protect the civilians while driving the beastmen out. They will stick to the windows, fire at incoming attackers with their bows, and try to stab or shove beastmen attempting to break within the inn. They will recognize the players as more competent combatants than them and follow their orders (so long as the players haven't done anything to sabotage their relationship.)

Each group of beastmen consists of a **longhorn**, a **shorthorn**, and a **shorthorn raider** with the Shadow Hide mutation (described later in this document).

#### Beastmen Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

Note that some of the following tactics will apply to beastmen and may only be used variations of the encounter at certain difficulties. 

#### General Abilities

The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Shorthorn Tactics
These beastmen are weak and cowardly by nature and will usually only press an attack if they feel they have an advantage that tips the odds in their favor. This advantage could range from a surprise attack to overwhelming numbers or the use of forested terrain to launch hit-and-run attacks. Once they feel they're on the winning side, shorthorns will charge in with the same reckless ferocity common to most beastmen.

\columnbreak

##### Shorthorn Tormentors
These beastmen typically move ahead of the rest of their warband, setting up ambushes that their allies can capitalize on. If they can pull off the ambush, they'll use their poisonous attacks to weaken players and leave them more susceptible to the charges of other beastmen. Once an enemy is prone, the tormentors will surround it and ensure it can't get back up. These tactics make tormentors ideal allies for stronger beastmen like longhorns and besthorns.

##### Shorthorn Raiders and Stalkers
These beastmen are unique in that they avoid rushing into battle to use their Charge ability. Instead, they specialize in targeting foes their allies can't reach in close combat. They are skillful and opportunistic archers and will take cover between their attacks whenever possible.

#### Longhorn Tactics
Longhorns make up the bulk of most beastmen warherds. When fighting together, they form a rowdy mob drunk on their confidence and recklessly charging into enemies. If the fight doesn't quickly go in their favor, sobering reality may set in, causing them to break and flee if they don't have a leader keeping them in line.

##### Longhorn Ravagers
These beastmen's signature ability is Swig. They will typically expend a use of the ability just before combat, letting the poisoned condition clear while retaining the temporary hit points. 

In the heat of battle, they will use the Swig ability again if they lose their Primal Fury or they drop below half health. It's important that they use Swig after they've made their attacks for the turn so they can minimize the disadvantage from being poisoned.

Because of their drunken nature, these beastmen will be even more wild and reckless than the rest of their kin, and you can reflect this by having them take more foolhardy actions in combat.

\pagebreakNum

### Aftermath
If the battle is clearly not going their way, the beastmen will retreat into the woods or run off to look for softer targets to raid. Once they've recovered from any injuries, they may attempt to gather reinforcements to make another attack on the inn. This may happen within the same night or the next day. 

If people start fleeing the inn, the beastmen may become divided as some chase after their victims and others remain to plunder the inn. However, few of them will stray from the inn until they know its defenders have been defeated.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables the beastmen leave behind.

For every 4 of inn's inhabitants that make it through the attack, they will give the players an art object worth 25 gp as an expression of their gratitude.

#### XP Award: 4,000xp
The degree of success the players have in protecting the inn's inhabitants can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** No more than 4 of the inn's inhabitants are lost.
* **100% XP:** No more than 8 of the inn's inhabitants are lost.
* **50% XP:** No more than 14 of the inn's inhabitants are lost.
* **10% XP:** More than 14 of the inn's inhabitants are lost.

Change the XP award to 1,500 XP. <br><br>

**Harder Encounter (Levels 8-10).** Change the beastmen groups to each consist of a **shorthorn tormentor**, a **longhorn ravager**, and a **shorthorn stalker** (without the Shadow Hide mutation).
Change the XP award to 8,000 XP. <br><br>

**Hardest Encounter (Levels 11-13).** Change the beastmen groups to each consist of a **shorthorn tormentor**, a **longhorn ravager**, and a **shorthorn stalker** with the Shadow Hide mutation.
Change the XP award to 14,000 XP.
