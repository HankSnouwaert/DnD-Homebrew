## The Minotaur <br> Chieftain's Labyrinth <br> (Player Level: 15-17)
In this encounter, the players must navigate a labyrinth inhabited by savage minotaurs and confront the minotaur chieftain who lies within.
### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as a standalone mini-dungeon or as part of a much larger dungeon crawl. All that is needed for context is that the players have a reason to reach the end of the maze, either to specifically slay the minotaur chieftain or to retrieve something he is guarding.





### Labyrinth Encounters
The labyrinth map features several groups of monsters scattered across various locations. Though, in the setting, the monsters may be wandering throughout the labyrinth, for the purposes of running the game, you can treat them as though they are in these static locations and have them "find" the players whenever the party comes too close.

**Starting an Encounter.**  Whenever the players reach a location on the map marked with "Encounter Start," there's the potential for them to come into contact with the creatures there. As all the monsters in the labyrinth are actively being stealthy, have the creatures associated with that encounter make Dexterity (Stealth) checks against the players' passive Perception. If the players are attempting to move stealthily, you can do the same for the players. If one side notices the other without being noticed, they can surprise their opponents in combat.

If the players make an excessive amount of noise near one of the encounter locations, you may also opt to have the monsters there strike out and hunt down the players.

**Ending Encounters.** The labyrinth's monsters want nothing more than to slay and devour the players. Once they detect the players, they will pursue them until they've hunted down their quarry. If a group of monsters is badly losing a fight, it may opt to retreat and later ambush the players when they least suspect it.


### Labyrinth Loot
The locations marked with 'L' on the map contain spare loot the players can discover. This should generally come in the form of a consumable magic item or wealth. For example, each location could contain 1d6 1,000gp gems and a magic item from Magic Item Table C of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The final encounter could also contain a larger portion of an entire treasure hoard. You can adjust the value of this loot based on the difficulty level of the labyrinth.

### Running The Maze Without A Map
If you're playing using theater of the mind and do not wish to describe every turn and hallway in the labyrinth, you can instead have them make six different Wisdom (Survival) checks to attempt to reach the final chamber. For each check they pass, they choose the correct path and avoid an encounter. Every time they fail a check, they take a wrong turn, which leads them into an encounter.

### Minotaur Tactics
Below are some tips for running the minotaurs in the labyrinth.
#### Common Traits
* Formidable melee fighters.
* Lower health but higher damage output.
* Possess Blood Greed trait, increasing damage and appetite for flesh.
* After a kill, they may gorge on the prey rather than pursue other nearby enemies.

#### Minotaur Combat Style
* Favors a full gore attack, knocking targets back 10 feet.
* Typically backs up to charge again, unless blood greed is active.
* When blood greed is active, uses a greataxe or charges at an accessible enemy, risking opportunity attacks.

#### Minotaur Butcher
* Higher defense than regular Minotaurs.
* Blood Greed activation enhances Hewing Cleaver attack and triggers Blood Regeneration for better survivability.

#### Gorebull
* Capable of making two attacks per turn; first a gore to knock a target prone, then a greataxe attack with advantage.
* Can charge at two different targets if able.
* While under the effects of Blood Greed, prefers two Hewing Greataxe attacks for increased damage.
* Uses Slaughtererâ€™s Call before combat to rally minotaurs and gain tactical advantage.

#### Doombull
* Begins combat by charging to knock a target prone.
* Follows up with Barbed Fist to inflict wounds that can be exploited by fellow minotaurs.
* Coordinates attacks to keep the target prone, maximizing damage with Hewing Greataxe.
* Prioritizes reapplying wounds to maintain tactical advantage if the target recovers.



### XP Award
Because the goal of the labyrinth is to reach its end rather than clear it of enemies, you may opt not to award XP for players defeating groups of enemies because they took wrong turns. When the players reach the end of the labyrinth and defeat the chieftain, you can award them an extra XP determined by the difficulty of the labyrinth in addition to normal XP from defeating the monsters.

\columnbreak

### Adjusting the Difficulty
You can adjust the difficulty of the labyrinth depending on the number of players and their average character level by using different creatures at the marker locations on the map.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Labyrinth Raiders:** A nearby village has been suffering from nightly raids by minotaurs emerging from a labyrinth. The players are hired to enter the labyrinth, navigate its deadly traps and ferocious minotaur guardians, and ultimately defeat the minotaur chieftain who commands the raiding parties. |
|  2  | **The Minotaur's Prize:** An ancient artifact of immense power is said to be hidden within a labyrinth now occupied by minotaurs. The players must venture into the labyrinth, overcome its many dangers, and retrieve the artifact before the minotaur chieftain can use it to consolidate his power.|
|  3  |**The Labyrinth of Lost Heroes:** Many heroes have entered the labyrinth, seeking glory and riches, but none have returned. The players must follow in their footsteps, uncover the fates of those who came before, and defeat the minotaur chieftain who has claimed the lives of so many adventurers.
 |
|  4  |**The Cursed Crown:** A powerful, cursed crown has found its way into the labyrinth, now worn by the minotaur chieftain. The players must venture into the maze, battle through hordes of minotaurs, and defeat the chieftain to destroy the crown and lift its curse from the land. |

# Encounter Creatures

## Minotaur Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them. You may apply these mutations to creatures who don't have the beastman creature type, but some of the effects may require the creature to have the Primal Fury, Blood Greed or Charge abilities.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

### Goregreed (Requires Blood Greed)

*The beastman's hunger for flesh can not be stated; the more blood it tastes, the greater it hungers.*

When the beastman's Blood Greed trait activates, it gets +2 to attack rolls. This ability can stack up to three times. It loses all stacks if it ends its turn without activating Blood Greed.



### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Beastman's Gore attack deals extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage in addition to it's normal damage if it moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit.

### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
> * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.

### Minotaur Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from minotaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Minotaur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
