## Stoneheart's Labyrinth <br> (Player Level: 15-17)
In this encounter, the players must navigate a labyrinth inhabited by savage minotaurs and confront the shamanistically possessed minotaur lord known as Stoneheart, who lies within.


### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as a standalone mini-dungeon or as part of a much larger dungeon crawl. All that is needed for context is that the players have a reason to reach the end of the maze, either to specifically slay Stoneheart or to retrieve something he's guarding.

### Labyrinth Encounters
The labyrinth map features several groups of monsters scattered across various locations. Though, in the setting, the monsters may be wandering throughout the labyrinth, for the purposes of running the game, you can treat them as though they are in these static locations and have them "find" the players whenever the party comes too close.

**Starting an Encounter.**  Whenever the players reach a location on the map marked with "Encounter Start," there's the potential for them to come into contact with the creatures there. As all the monsters in the labyrinth are actively being stealthy, have the creatures associated with that encounter make Dexterity (Stealth) checks against the players' passive Perception. If the players are attempting to move stealthily, you can do the same for the players. If one side notices the other without being noticed, they can surprise their opponents in combat.

If the players make an excessive amount of noise near one of the encounter locations, you may also opt to have the monsters there strike out and hunt down the players.

**Ending Encounters.** The labyrinth's monsters want nothing more than to slay and devour the players. Once they detect the players, they will pursue them until they've hunted down their quarry. If a group of monsters is badly losing a fight, it may opt to retreat and later ambush the players when they least suspect it.


### Running The Maze Without A Map
If you're playing using theater of the mind and do not wish to describe every turn and hallway in the labyrinth, you can instead have them make six different Wisdom (Survival) checks to attempt to reach the final chamber. For each check they pass, they choose the correct path and avoid an encounter. Every time they fail a check, they take a wrong turn, which leads them into an encounter.

### Labyrinth Loot
The locations marked with 'L' on the map contain spare loot the players can discover. This should generally come in the form of a consumable magic item or wealth. For example, each location could contain 1d6 1,000gp gems and a magic item from Magic Item Table C of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The final encounter could also contain a larger portion of an entire treasure hoard. You can adjust the value of this loot based on the difficulty level of the labyrinth.

### Stoneheart's Chamber

When the players reach Stoneheart's chamber, it will initially be empty. Once a player reaches the encounter's starting point within the lair, Stoneheart (along with his minions) will be summoned. The area marked in red will ignite, with flames reaching the ceiling until Stoneheart is defeated or disappears.

\pagebreakNum

When a creature enters the fire's area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage. The area is also heavily obscured.

If the party flees, Stoneheart, along with any remaining minions, will disappear and regain all of their hit points after one minute. Any slain minions will be replaced after this minute as well.


### Minotaur Tactics
Below are some tips for running the minotaurs in the labyrinth.
#### Common Traits
* Formidable melee fighters.
* Lower health but higher damage output.
* Possess Blood Greed trait, increasing damage and appetite for flesh.
* After a kill, they may gorge on the prey rather than pursue other nearby enemies.

#### Minotaur Combat Style
* Favors a full gore attack, knocking targets back 10 feet.
* Typically backs up to charge again, unless blood greed is active.
* When blood greed is active, uses a greataxe or charges at an accessible enemy, risking opportunity attacks.

#### Minotaur Butcher
* Higher defense than regular Minotaurs.
* Blood Greed activation enhances Hewing Cleaver attack and triggers Blood Regeneration for better survivability.

#### Gorebull
* Capable of making two attacks per turn; first a gore to knock a target prone, then a greataxe attack with advantage.
* Can charge at two different targets if able.
* While under the effects of Blood Greed, prefers two Hewing Greataxe attacks for increased damage.
* Uses Slaughtererâ€™s Call before combat to rally minotaurs and gain tactical advantage.

#### Doombull
* Begins combat by charging to knock a target prone.
* Follows up with Barbed Fist to inflict wounds that can be exploited by fellow minotaurs.
* Coordinates attacks to keep the target prone, maximizing damage with Hewing Greataxe.
* Prioritizes reapplying wounds to maintain tactical advantage if the target recovers.

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.


\columnbreak

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

##### Besthorn Manrippers
These beastmen prioritize attacking targets with low Strength so they can best utilize their Hewing Greataxe attacks. However, if the enemies they can reach all have high AC or abilities that make them hard to hit, the manrippers will change their strategy to attacking foes that are grouped up so they can attempt to make use of their Arcing Swing ability.

### Bray Speaker Tactics

Bray speakers serve as the primary spellcasters of the beastmen war herds. Unlike most other spellcasters, they are fairly durable and can engage in melee combat while using their spells. With their Primal Fury active, bray speakers can cast spells while also making attacks. This makes them formidable foes as they don't suffer the vulnerabilities of most spellcasters and won't hesitate to dive into melee combat.

The lore of magic a bray speaker is specialized in significantly influences its combat tactics. Below are tactics specific to the different lores and their spells:


#### Lore of Beasts

These bray speakers primarily serve a support role, which is helped by the fact that their Wild Heart trait works with most beastmen creatures.



##### Lore of Beasts Spells

&emsp;**Pass Without Trace:** This ideally cast before combat begins. However, if allies can hide as a bonus action during combat, this spell remains useful during the fight.

**Amber Spear:** This should be cast when there's an opportunity to hit two or more targets.

**Aspect of the Beast:** This is typically cast on the speaker's most powerful ally. Ripping Jaws is generally the most useful for the Beastmen. With it, a beastman can use its Charge ability to topple a target and then bite with a higher chance of success. Additionally, the extra piercing damage from Primal Fury boosts the temporary hit points gained from the Ripping Jaws attack.

**Heroism:** This spell can be useful for either other beastmen or the speaker. It ensures the target isn't easily frightened, helping to mainain their Primal Fury. 

It's important to remember that this spell only benefits from the Wild Heart trait when cast at 1st level. For higher-level speakers, this often becomes their primary concentration spell.

\pagebreakNum

**Monstrous Transformation:** This spell acts as a reset for the speaker. Upon transformation, the likelihood of reverting to their original form during combat is minimal. This spell is generally activated when the speaker's health drops below half or when it loses Primal Fury. While the transformed creature can't cast spells, any prior ongoing spells persist. 

Depending on the situation, the speaker might transform into a:

* **Manticore.** Preferable when adversaries have limited ranged capabilities

* **Hydra.** Chosen when foes have a lower damage output or can't focus their attacks on the transformed speaker

* **Dragon.** Optimal when opponents are grouped together, allowing the dragon's breath to hit multiple targets or when facing adversaries with high elemental damage output.

#### Lore of The Wild
Bray speakers dedicated to this lore tend to be less melee-focused, especially those with access to the Savage Domain spell. The majority of their spells require concentration, but their Bestial Surge trait allows them to maintain multiple spells at once, and they will often have at least one spell going that can help them disrupt the concentration of enemy spellcasters.





##### Lore of the Wild Spells

**Savage Dominion:** This spell is cast pre-combat unless doing so would jeopardize a surprise attack. While maintaining concentration on this spell, the speaker keeps its distance, remaining within 60 feet of the summoned monster. The type of summoned creature is typically random unless the speaker possesses prior knowledge about adversaries.

The choices are:

* **Giant:** Chosen if adversaries are adept at avoiding melee or are fighting at a distance

* **Jabberwocky:** Chosen when the objective is to hamper foes with the creature's Burble and other debilitating effects. (Remember that the Burble ability is indiscriminate, potentially affecting even the speaker if it gets too close.)

* **Behemoth:** A versatile monster, adept at singling out and consuming targets, as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

**Mad Rampage:** This should be cast on a unit with multiple attacks. Great speakers might cast it on the creature summoned with *savage domain*.

**Vile Tide:** This should be used when it can target two or more opponents or disrupt a spell-concentrating foe, especially if *devolve* has already been used on them.

**Primal Scream:** This should be reserved for critical moments. It's typically cast on the speaker itself or on powerful allies like a warhorn or a creature summoned by *savage domain*. It's most effective when the targeted unit is at half-health and can affect at least two foes with the scream.

**Devolve:** This spell is saved for when the speaker can target an enemy spellcaster with it.

\columnbreak

### Stoneheart Tactics

#### Not Possessed
* Engages primarily in melee combat.
* **Typical Attack Sequence:** 
    * Gores a target, follows with a strike from his Hewing Greataxe.
    * If movement permits, may gore two different targets.
    * Against aerial opponents, uses Wing Puncturing Javelin.
* Utilizes legendary actions to maximize movement and damage output.



#### Possessed

* Shifts to a spellcasting role, focusing on area control and debuffs.
* Maintains distance from opponents
* Starts turns by maximizing Corrupting Influence effects, targeting multiple opponents with spells.
* **Sequence in combat:**
    * Casts a spell
    * Follows up with Hewing Greataxe for close <Br> targets, or Atrophy Blot for ranged attacks.
    * Uses legendary actions  for Dark Surge to <br> maintain battlefield control.



### XP Award
Because the goal of the labyrinth is to reach its end rather than clear it of enemies, you may opt not to award XP for players defeating groups of enemies because they took wrong turns. When the players reach the end of the labyrinth and defeat the chieftain, you can award them an extra XP determined by the difficulty of the labyrinth in addition to normal XP from defeating the monsters.

## Minotaur Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them. You may apply these mutations to creatures who don't have the beastman creature type, but some of the effects may require the creature to have the Primal Fury, Blood Greed or Charge abilities.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

### Crown of Horns 
*This creature is gifted with especially large and grandiose twisting horns, granting it extreme confidence, for it knows it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

When the beastman makes a Wisdom check caused by its Primal Fury ability, it automatically succeeds unless it has disadvantage on the roll.

### Goregreed (Requires Blood Greed)

*The beastman's hunger for flesh can not be stated; the more blood it tastes, the greater it hungers.*

When the beastman's Blood Greed trait activates, it gets +2 to attack rolls. This ability can stack up to three times. It loses all stacks if it ends its turn without activating Blood Greed.


### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury or Blood Greed ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

### Epic Battle: Dual Souls

For an epic encounter with Stoneheart, give the Bray Speaker spirit possessing him its own pool of 310 hit points, which it regains after a short or long rest. 

Whenever Stoneheart takes damage while possessed, the damage is instead dealt to the Bray Speaker. If this damage reduces the Bray Speaker to 0 hit points, Stoneheart takes the remaining damage and loses the Possessed trait. Conversely, if Stoneheart is reduced to 0 hit points, the Bray Speaker takes the remaining damage. In this case, the Stoneheart automatically becomes possessed, losing the ability to make saving throws to end the possession.

Stoneheart only dies if both he and the Bray Speaker are reduced to 0 hit points.

For this encounter, increase Stoneheart's challenge rating (CR) to 22.

### New Lore of Beasts Spells
#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Aspect of the Beast

*4th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

### New Lore of The Wilds Spells
#### Devolve
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of lizard brain)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Druid, Sorcerer

You choose a creature you can see within range. It must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be overwhelmed by the primal aspects of its psyche for the duration of the spell. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. 

While affected, the creature:
* Has disadvantage on Intelligence and Charisma checks
* Cannot cast or concentrate on spells
* Cannot activate magic items
* Cannot speak or understand any language
* Is treated as a beast with an Intelligence score of 4 when targeted by spells and abilities that normally only target beasts, such as *dominate beast* or *beast bond* (This doesn't change its actual Intelligence score)

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, the affected creature takes 1d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns while under this spell's effects before it makes the saving throw. When cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Mad Rampage

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a stinger)
- **Duration:**  1 minute
- **Classes:**   Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock

You plunge a willing creature within range that you can see into a frenzied state, making it reckless and heedless of danger. 

For the duration of the spell:
* The creature incurs a âˆ’2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature becomes quickened.
* When the creature hits with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, it deals an additional die of its damage. If the creature moves at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making the attack, the attack deals two additional dice of its damage, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

If the creature is charmed or frightened, these effects are suspended for the duration of this spell.

\columnbreak




#### Primal Scream
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A goat hair)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Bard
___

You or a willing creature of your choice within range is filled with primal vigor and releases a powerful howling roar in a 30-foot cone. If the target is prone, it can immediately stand up without using any movement. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone.

Additionally, the creature releasing the roar regains 3d8 hit points. Constructs and undead cannot regain hit points from this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the damage and healing increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Savage Dominion

*7th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Warlock
___

You call forth a formidable creature of your choice: a **Stone Hurling Giant**, a **Madding Jabberwocky**, or a **Hungering Behemoth** (stat blocks found on next two pages). It materializes in an unoccupied space within range and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

This primitive creature is allied with you and your companions. It acts on your initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. You can telepathically communicate with the creature while you are on the same plane, and you are both aware of each other's locations. It follows your telepathic commands without requiring an action from you. If not given any commands, it automatically moves toward and attacks the nearest creature it detects.

If the creature moves more than 100 feet from you, your concentration on the spell is broken. Additionally, at the start of its turn, if the creature has taken damage since its last turn, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn't disappear but becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and you lose control over it. The uncontrolled creature cannot be dismissed by you and will disappear 1 hour after it was summoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the summoned creature gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 7th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, the spell's duration extends to 8 hours.

\pagebreakNum


#### Vile Tide
*2nd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M  (A few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
___

You cause a swarm of insects to erupt from the ground within a 10-foot square area at a point you choose within range. Each creature standing in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 piercing damage, and insects burrow into the creature, remaining there for the spell's duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage, and the insects do not burrow into it. 

While the insects are burrowed in a creature, the creature has disadvantage on checks, cannot regain hit points, and takes 2d4 piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. 

Any creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the insects from a creature. This check must be done using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, and it causes 1d4 damage of its damage type to the target. On a successful check, all the insects are destroyed, and the spell ends for that creature. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the insects, but if it does, the target takes 3d4 damage instead. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

If the thrown creature or object would land in the space of one or more creatures, each of those creatures must make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC.

On a successful save, it dodges out of the way, takes no damage, and is not knocked prone.

> ***Burble.*** At the end of the jabberwocky's turn, each creature within 30 feet of it that can hear it must make a Wisdom saving against you spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature is frightened until the start of its next turn. While frightened this way, it is dazed. If a creatureâ€™s saving throw is successful, it is immune to the Burble of the jabberwocky for the next hour.

> ***Dripping Jaws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage and the target covered in acid for one minute or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes 5 (2d4) acid damage at the end of each of its turns.
>
> ***Snatching Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) slashing damage. The target is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save throw). The jabberwocky has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Eyes of Flame.*** The jabberwocky shoots a beam of fire from its eyes in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line's area must make a Dexterity save against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (4d4) fire damage and is set on fire; until a creature uses its action to douse the fire on itself or another creature, the target takes 5 (2d4) fire damage at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not set on fire.

If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by the attack, the behemoth may make another Rend attack against a different creature within 10 feet of the original target and within range of this attack. The behemoth does not gain another attack if it reduces the new target to 0 hit points.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the behemoth can't bite another target. If the target is a Large or smaller and already grappled by the behemoth, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behemoth, and it takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the behemoth's turns. If the behemoth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

### New Spell

#### Mystic Signal

*5th-level transmutation (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** self
- **Components:**  V, S, M (A focus worth at least 500 gp, such as a war horn, marble bird, or a gem encrusted jaw bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
___

This spell enables you to broadcast a brief message, no longer than four seconds in length, to each creature within 3 miles of your location. Recipients of the message hear it in their minds and, if they know you, recognize you as the sender. Additionally, they discern your distance and direction at the time of casting. The spell ensures that creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 1 can comprehend the message's meaning. 

A sleeping creature can hear the message and may choose to awaken upon hearing it.

You can tailor the spell to target specific types of creatures only, such as humans, giants, unicorns, etc.

The message cannot be received by any creature if there is any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocking a direct path between you and the creature.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
