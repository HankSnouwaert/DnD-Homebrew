## The Herdstone Ritual <br> (Player Level: 8-9)
In this encounter, the players battle a beastman shaman before his massive herdstone deep in the forest as he performs a ritual that will soon transform his captive victims into savage beastmen minions.

### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as part of a rescue mission in which the players are trying to free captives taken by the bray shaman before he completes his ritual. It's also possible they have simply come to face the shaman from performing a ritual and only learn about the captives upon arrival. In either case, the prospect of the ritual being done at a certain time when the moon and heavens align could add time pressure to an adventure with this encounter as the climax.

### Lead Up
When the players arrive and can see the captives and the ritual being performed, anyone who wants to determine what the ritual will do can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to assess the symbols. If they succeed, they will understand that the captives will soon be transformed into beastmen if not freed in time.

If the beastmen detect the players' presence, they will begin the ritual early.

### Map Description
* **Forest Foliage.** These areas are non-magical difficult terrain that provide cover and heavily obscure creatures within them.
* **Rock Cliffs.** These land features can be climbed with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.


### The Ritual
On initiative count of 20 on the first round of combat, the shaman will be surrounded with magical energy from the ritual, rendering him incapacitated and invulnerable (the temporary invulnerability should be made clear to the players.) At this point, one of the four stones with prisoners tied to it will begin to glow (pick the one closest to the most players). On initiative count 20, three turns later, any prisoner still tied to the stone will transform into a longhorn that is loyal to the shaman and hostile towards the players. At this point, another stone with prisoners tied to it will begin to glow, and the process will repeat itself. You can either roll for the stones randomly or have them activate in a clockwise or counterclockwise order to make it easier for the players to predict where they will need to go next

When the second stone begins to glow, the ritual's energies will stop surging through the shaman, and he will no longer be invulnerable and incapacitated.

<br>

The ritual will continue even if the shaman is killed and only ends if there are no longer any prisoners tied to the rocks and all the beastmen in the area are dead (including any prisoners who've transformed into beastmen.)

### Freeing the Prisoners
There is a prisoner tied to each of the each of the four minor stones surrounding the central stone. A prisoner's restraints can be broken with a successful DC 15 Strength check or destroyed by dealing 10 damage to them. The restraints are a small object with an AC 13.

Any freed captive will attempt to flee from combat to the safest place they can find.

### Beastmen Tactics
The beastmen will prioritize stopping players from freeing the captives as they complete the ritual. Though beastmen are generally aggressive ambush fighters, the nature of this encounter keeps them from leveraging Bestial Ambush ability and puts them in a more reactionary role. 

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/fdSjS1K/heardstone-guide.png' style='position:absolute; top:70px; right:2px; width:415px;' />

\pagebreakNum




The beastmen fighters still have some traits they can leverage in this fight:

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### The Shaman's Tactics
**Savage Dominion:** This spell is cast as the shaman starts the ritual. While maintaining concentration on this spell (and not incapicated by the ritual), the shaman keeps its distance, remaining within 60 feet of the summoned monster. The type of summoned creature is typically random unless the shaman possesses prior knowledge about adversaries.

The choices are:

* **Giant:** Chosen if adversaries are adept at avoiding melee or are fighting at a distance

* **Jabberwocky:** Chosen when the objective is to hamper foes with the creature's Burble and other debilitating effects. (Remember that the Burble ability is indiscriminate, potentially affecting even the shaman if it gets too close.)

* **Behemoth:** A versatile monster, adept at singling out and consuming targets, as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

**Mad Rampage:** This should be cast on a unit with multiple attacks. Great Shamans might cast it on the creature summoned with *savage domain*.

**Vile Tide:** This should be used when it can target two or more opponents or disrupt a spell-concentrating foe, especially if *devolve* has already been used on them.

**Bray Scream:** This should be reserved for critical moments. It's typically cast on the shaman itself or on powerful allies like a Wargor or a creature summoned by *savage domain*. It's most effective when the targeted unit is at half-health and can affect at least two foes with the scream.

**Devolve:** This spell is saved for when the shaman can target an enemy spellcaster with it.


### Aftermath
The beastmen will fight to the death, protecting their herdstone, which they view as sacred. If the players flee, the beastmen will remain until the ritual is complete and all the captives have transformed. At this point, they will pursue the players through the woods, potentially leading to a chase encounter.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what the slain beastmen leave behind. Don't use these tables for any beastmen that were former captives.

Because this encounter is likely the final encounter of an adventure, you could also award the players with a treasure hoard of the appropriate level for the difficulty of the encounter. The loot would consist of wealth the beastmen accumulated throughout their raiding, along with magic items that may have caught the shaman's fancy.

#### XP Award
For every three captives the players save, award them 2,000 XP and an additional 4,000 XP if the slay the shaman.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty by using different beastmen mob tables and changing the XP award accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Levels 5-7).** Replace the **bray shaman** with a **lesser bray shaman**, and replace the initial 4 **longhorns** with **shorthorns**. Increase the time between a stone glowing and the transformation of its captive to 4 rounds, at which point the next stone begins glowing.

Change the XP award for every three captives saved to 1,000 XP and 2,000 XP for slaying the shaman.

**Harder Encounter (Levels 12-14).** Replace the **bray shaman** with a **great bray shaman**, and replace the initial 4 **longhorns** with **besthorns**. Reduce the time between a stone glowing and the transformation of its captive to 2 rounds, at which point the next stone begins glowing.

Change the XP award for every three captives saved to 4,000 XP and 8,000 XP for slaying the shaman.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Dark Pact:** The players uncover a plot involving a corrupt noble secretly allied with the bray shaman. The noble is providing captives for the shamanâ€™s ritual in exchange for power.  |
|  2  | **The Missing Villagers:** The players learn that beastman raiders have been snatching villagers away into the woods. The forest trail leads them through perilous beastman territory to where the bray shaman is performing his transformation ritual on the captives.|
|  3  |**The Lost Expedition:** An expedition team sent to study the flora and fauna of the forest has gone missing. The playersâ€™ search for the team leads them to the herdstone, where they find that the bray shaman has captured the team to transform them into beastmen. |
|  4  |**The Blood Moon Ritual:** A prophesied event known as the Blood Moon is approaching, during which the bray shaman plans to perform his transformation ritual. The players must race against time to locate the herdstone, battle through the beastmen guardians, and stop the ritual before the culmination of the Blood Moon, preventing a surge in beastmen forces. |

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A goat hair)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous

___

You or a willing creature of your choice within range is filled with primal vigor and releases a powerful howling roar in a 30-foot cone. If the target is prone, it can immediately stand up without using any movement. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Additionally, the creature releasing the roar regains 3d8 hit points. Constructs and undead cannot regain hit points from this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the damage and healing increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

* Cannot cast or concentrate on spells
* Cannot activate magic items
* Cannot speak or understand any language
* Is treated as a beast with an Intelligence score of 4 when targeted by spells and abilities that normally only target beasts, such as *dominate beast* or *beast bond* (This doesn't change its actual Intelligence score)

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, the affected creature takes 1d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns while under this spell's effects before it makes the saving throw. When cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

You plunge a willing creature within range that you can see into a frenzied state, making it reckless and heedless of danger.

* The creature becomes quickened.
* When the creature hits with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, it deals an additional die of its damage. If the creature moves at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making the attack, the attack deals two additional dice of its damage, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

If the creature is charmed or frightened, these effects are suspended for the duration of this spell.

#### Mystic Signal

*5th-level transmutation (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** self
- **Components:**  V, S, M (A focus worth at least 500 gp, such as a war horn, marble bird, or a gem encrusted jaw bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
___

This spell enables you to broadcast a brief message, no longer than four seconds in length, to each creature within 3 miles of your location. Recipients of the message hear it in their minds and, if they know you, recognize you as the sender. Additionally, they discern your distance and direction at the time of casting. The spell ensures that creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 1 can comprehend the message's meaning. 

A sleeping creature can hear the message and may choose to awaken upon hearing it.

You can tailor the spell to target specific types of creatures only, such as humans, giants, unicorns, etc.

The message cannot be received by any creature if there is any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocking a direct path between you and the creature.

#### Savage Dominion

*7th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Warlock
___

You call forth a formidable creature of your choice: a **Stone Hurling Giant**, a **Madding Jabberwocky**, or a **Hungering Behemoth** (stat blocks found on next two pages). It materializes in an unoccupied space within range and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

This primitive creature is allied with you and your companions. It acts on your initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. You can telepathically communicate with the creature while you are on the same plane, and you are both aware of each other's locations. It follows your telepathic commands without requiring an action from you. If not given any commands, it automatically moves toward and attacks the nearest creature it detects.

If the creature moves more than 100 feet from you, your concentration on the spell is broken. Additionally, at the start of its turn, if the creature has taken damage since its last turn, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn't disappear but becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and you lose control over it. The uncontrolled creature cannot be dismissed by you and will disappear 1 hour after it was summoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the summoned creature gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 7th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, the spell's duration extends to 8 hours.

#### Vile Tide
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M  (A few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
___

You cause a swarm of insects to erupt from the ground within a 10-foot square area at a point you choose within range. Each creature standing in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 piercing damage, and insects burrow into the creature, remaining there for the spell's duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage, and the insects do not burrow into it. 

While the insects are burrowed in a creature, the creature has disadvantage on checks, cannot regain hit points, and takes 2d4 piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. 

Any creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the insects from a creature. This check must be done using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, and it causes 1d4 damage of its damage type to the target. On a successful check, all the insects are destroyed, and the spell ends for that creature. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the insects, but if it does, the target takes 3d4 damage instead. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not set on fire.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the behemoth can't bite another target. If the target is a Large or smaller and already grappled by the behemoth, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behemoth, and it takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the behemoth's turns. If the behemoth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
