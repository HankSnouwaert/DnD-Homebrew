## The Herdstone Ritual <br> (Player Level: 8-9)
In this encounter, the players battle a beastman shaman before his massive herdstone deep in the forest as he performs a ritual that will soon transform his captive victims into savage beastmen minions.

### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as part of a rescue mission in which the players are trying to free captives taken by the bray shaman before he completes his ritual. It's also possible they have simply come to face the shaman from performing a ritual and only learn about the captives upon arrival. In either case, the prospect of the ritual being done at a certain time when the moon and heavens align could add time pressure to an adventure with this encounter as the climax.

### Lead Up
When the players arrive and can see the captives and the ritual being performed, anyone who wants to determine what the ritual will do can make a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to assess the symbols. If they succeed, they will understand that the captives will soon be transformed into beastmen if not freed in time.

If the beastmen detect the players' presence, they will begin the ritual early.

### Map Description
* **Forest Foliage.** These areas are non-magical difficult terrain that provide cover and heavily obscure creatures within them.
* **Rock Cliffs.** These land features can be climbed with a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.


### The Ritual
On initiative count of 20 on the first round of combat, the shaman will be 
involved with magical energy from the ritual, rendering him incapacitated and invulnerable (the temporary invulnerability should be made clear to the players.) At this point, one of the four stones with a prisoner tied to it will begin to glow. On initiative count 20, three turns later, any prisoner still tied to the stone will transform into a longhorn that is loyal to the shaman and hostile towards the players. At this point, another stone with a prisoner tied to it will begin to glow, and the process will repeat itself.

When the second stone begins to glow, the ritual's energies will stop surging through the shaman, and he will no longer be invulnerable and incapacitated. 

The ritual will continue even if the shaman is killed and only ends if there are no longer any prisoners tied to the rocks and all the beastmen in the area are dead (including any prisoners who've transformed into beastmen.)

### Freeing the Prisoners
There is a prisoner tied to each of the each of the four minor stones surrounding the central stone. A prisoner's rope restraints can be broken with a successful DC 15 Strength check or destroyed by dealing 10 damage to them. The rope is a small object with an AC 13. (NOTE: Should the damage types not be limited like for other rope?)

Any freed captive will attempt to flee from combat to the safest place they can find.

### Beastmen Tactics
The beastmen will prioritize stopping players from freeing the captives as they complete the ritual. Though beastmen are generally aggressive ambush fighters, the nature of this encounter keeps them from leveraging Bestial Ambush ability and puts them in a more reactionary role. 

The beastmen fighters still have some traits they can leverage in this fight:

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### The Shaman's Tactics
Unlike most spellcasters, the shaman is fairly durable and can engage in melee combat while using his spells. With his Primal Fury active, he can cast spells while also making attacks. 

##### Using The Shaman's Spells
The difficulty level you're using for the encounter will determine what spells the shaman will have access to. The following spells will prove the most useful for this fight:

**Amber Spear:** This should be cast when there's an opportunity to hit two or more targets.

**Aspect of the Beast:** This is typically cast on the shaman's most powerful ally. Ripping Jaws is generally the most useful for the Beastmen. With it, a beastman can use its Charge ability to topple a target and then bite with a higher chance of success. Additionally, the extra piercing damage from Primal Fury boosts the temporary hit points gained from the Ripping Jaws attack.

**Heroism:** This spell can be useful for either other beastmen or the shaman. It ensures the target isn't easily frightened, helping to mainain their Primal Fury. 

It's important to remember that this spell only benefits from the Wild Heart trait when cast at 1st level. For higher-level shamans, this often becomes their primary concentration spell.

**Monstrous Transformation:** This spell acts as a reset for the shaman. Upon transformation, the likelihood of reverting to their original form during combat is minimal. This spell is generally activated when the shaman's health drops below half or when it loses Primal Fury. While the transformed creature can't cast spells, any prior ongoing spells persist. 

Depending on the situation, the shaman might transform into a:

* **Manticore.** Preferable when adversaries have limited ranged capabilities

* **Hydra.** Chosen when foes have a lower damage output or can't focus their attacks on the transformed shaman

* **Dragon.** Optimal when opponents are grouped together, allowing the dragon's breath to hit multiple targets or when facing adversaries with high elemental damage output.


### Aftermath
The beastmen will fight to the death, protecting their herdstone, which they view as sacred. If the players flee, the beastmen will remain until the ritual is complete and all the captives have transformed. At this point, they will pursue the players through the woods, potentially leading to a chase encounter.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what the slain beastmen leave behind. Don't use these tables for any beastmen that were former captives.

Because this encounter is likely the final encounter of an adventure, you could also award the players with a treasure hoard of the appropriate level for the difficulty of the encounter. The loot would consist of wealth the beastmen accumulated throughout their raiding, along with magic items that may have caught the shaman's fancy.

#### XP Award
For each captive the players save, award them 2,000 XP. If they slay the shaman, award them an additional 4,000 XP.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty by using different beastmen mob tables and changing the XP award accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Levels 5-7).** Replace the Bray Shaman with a Lesser Bray Shaman, and replace the initial 4 longhorns with shorthorns. Increase the time between a stone glowing and the transformation of its captive to 4 rounds, at which point the next stone begins glowing.

Change the XP award for each captive saved to 1,000 XP and the XP award for slaying the shaman to 2,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Levels 12-14).** Replace the Bray Shaman with a Great Bray Shaman, and replace the initial 4 longhorns with besthorns. Reduce the time between a stone glowing and the transformation of its captive to 2 rounds, at which point the next stone begins glowing.

Change the XP award for each captive saved to 4,000 XP and the XP award for slaying the shaman to 8,000 XP.
