## The Megataur's Labyrinth <br> (Player Level: 15-17)
In this encounter, the players must navigate a labyrinth inhabited by savage minotaurs and confront the monstrous megataur who lies within.


### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as a standalone mini-dungeon or as part of a much larger dungeon crawl. All that is needed for context is that the players have a reason to reach the end of the maze, either to specifically slay the megataur or to retrieve something it is guarding.

### Labyrinth Encounters
The labyrinth map features several groups of monsters scattered across various locations. Though, in the setting, the monsters may be wandering throughout the labyrinth, for the purposes of running the game, you can treat them as though they are in these static locations and have them "find" the players whenever the party comes too close.

**Starting an Encounter.**  Whenever the players reach a location on the map marked with "Encounter Start," there's the potential for them to come into contact with the creatures there. As all the monsters in the labyrinth are actively being stealthy, have the creatures associated with that encounter make Dexterity (Stealth) checks against the players' passive Perception. If the players are attempting to move stealthily, you can do the same for the players. If one side notices the other without being noticed, they can surprise their opponents in combat.

If the players make an excessive amount of noise near one of the encounter locations, you may also opt to have the monsters there strike out and hunt down the players.

**Ending Encounters.** The labyrinth's monsters want nothing more than to slay and devour the players. Once they detect the players, they will pursue them until they've hunted down their quarry. If a group of monsters is badly losing a fight, it may opt to retreat and later ambush the players when they least suspect it.


### Labyrinth Loot
The locations marked with 'L' on the map contain spare loot the players can discover. This should generally come in the form of a consumable magic item or wealth. For example, each location could contain 1d6 1,000gp gems and a magic item from Magic Item Table C of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The final encounter could also contain a larger portion of an entire treasure hoard. You can adjust the value of this loot based on the difficulty level of the labyrinth.

### Running The Maze Without A Map
If you're playing using theater of the mind and do not wish to describe every turn and hallway in the labyrinth, you can instead have them make six different Wisdom (Survival) checks to attempt to reach the final chamber. For each check they pass, they choose the correct path and avoid an encounter. Every time they fail a check, they take a wrong turn, which leads them into an encounter.

### Minotaur Tactics
Below are some tips for running the minotaurs in the labyrinth.
#### Common Traits
* Formidable melee fighters.
* Lower health but higher damage output.
* Possess Blood Greed trait, increasing damage and appetite for flesh.
* After a kill, they may gorge on the prey rather than pursue other nearby enemies.

#### Minotaur Combat Style
* Favors a full gore attack, knocking targets back 10 feet.
* Typically backs up to charge again, unless blood greed is active.
* When blood greed is active, uses a greataxe or charges at an accessible enemy, risking opportunity attacks.

#### Minotaur Butcher
* Higher defense than regular Minotaurs.
* Blood Greed activation enhances Hewing Cleaver attack and triggers Blood Regeneration for better survivability.

#### Gorebull
* Capable of making two attacks per turn; first a gore to knock a target prone, then a greataxe attack with advantage.
* Can charge at two different targets if able.
* While under the effects of Blood Greed, prefers two Hewing Greataxe attacks for increased damage.
* Uses Slaughtererâ€™s Call before combat to rally minotaurs and gain tactical advantage.

#### Doombull
* Begins combat by charging to knock a target prone.
* Follows up with Barbed Fist to inflict wounds that can be exploited by fellow minotaurs.
* Coordinates attacks to keep the target prone, maximizing damage with Hewing Greataxe.
* Prioritizes reapplying wounds to maintain tactical advantage if the target recovers.

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.



**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.



\columnbreak

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

##### Besthorn Manrippers
These beastmen prioritize attacking targets with low Strength so they can best utilize their Hewing Greataxe attacks. However, if the enemies they can reach all have high AC or abilities that make them hard to hit, the manrippers will change their strategy to attacking foes that are grouped up so they can attempt to make use of their Arcing Swing ability.

### Megatuar Tactics
#### Combat Initiation
* Use Rushing Gore to close distance when enemies are out of reach.
* Once in melee range, target the physically strongest creature for blade arm attacks.
* Simultaneously attempt to grasp and swallow nearby, physically weaker creatures.

#### Rejuvenation Strategy
* The megataur requires creatures in its stomach to activate rejuvenation.
* If its health falls to half or less and there are no enemy creatures in its stomach or nearby, start swallowing weaker allied creatures to heal.

### XP Award
Because the goal of the labyrinth is to reach its end rather than clear it of enemies, you may opt not to award XP for players defeating groups of enemies because they took wrong turns. When the players reach the end of the labyrinth and defeat the chieftain, you can award them an extra XP determined by the difficulty of the labyrinth in addition to normal XP from defeating the monsters.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Beastmen's Fortress:** A labyrinth deep within the forest serves as a fortress for a coalition of beastmen tribes. The players must navigate the maze, defeat the various minotaur and beastmen guardians, and ultimately confront the megataur, who they keep sequestered in the final chamber.  |
|  2  | **The Blood Sacrifice:** The players learn of a dark ritual being performed within a labyrinth, where beastmen plan to sacrifice captives to empower a megataur. They must enter the labyrinth, rescue the captives, and stop the ritual by defeating the megataur before it can gain further power.|
|  3  |**The Labyrinth Arena:** The labyrinth is used as a gladiatorial arena by beastmen, where captured warriors are forced to fight for their lives. The players must navigate the maze, rescue the captives, and face the megataur that serves as the final challenge in the beastmen's brutal games. |
|  4  |**The Abyssal Gateway:** The labyrinth contains a gateway to the Abyss, guarded by beastmen who seek to unleash its horrors. The players must navigate the maze, close the gateway, and defeat the megataur in the final chamber to prevent an abyssal invasion. |

## Minotaur Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them. You may apply these mutations to creatures who don't have the beastman creature type, but some of the effects may require the creature to have the Primal Fury, Blood Greed or Charge abilities.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

### Gnarled Hide

*The beastman's hide has toughed up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The beastman gets +2 to its AC.

### Goregreed (Requires Blood Greed)

*The beastman's hunger for flesh can not be stated; the more blood it tastes, the greater it hungers.*

When the beastman's Blood Greed trait activates, it gets +2 to attack rolls. This ability can stack up to three times. It loses all stacks if it ends its turn without activating Blood Greed.





### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Beastman's Gore attack deals extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage in addition to it's normal damage if it moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit.

### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury or Blood Greed ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

> ***Swallow.*** The megataur makes one bite attack against each Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the megataur. At the start of each of the megataur's turns, each swallowed creature then takes 21 (4d6) acid damage. The megataur regains 5 hit points for each creature damaged this way. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by the acid damage, it dies, and its body is dissolved.

>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage.
>
> ***Blade Arm.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) slashing damage.
>
> ***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 23). The megataur has two Fists, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 33 (4d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the megataur moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 26 (4d12) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.
>
> ***Swallow.*** The megataur makes one bite attack against each Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the megataur. At the start of each of the megataur's turns, each swallowed creature gains a level of heat and then takes 14 (4d6) fire damage for each level of heat it has. The megataur regains 5 hit points for each creature damaged this way. A creature loses all stacks of heat once it is no longer restrained by the megataur. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by the fire damage, it dies, and its body is dissolved. The megataur dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regain hit points from this feature.
>

> ### Bonus Action

> ***Rushing Gore.*** When the megataur takes the Dash action, it can make a Gore attack.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The megataur can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The megataur regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Blood Call.** The megataur chooses a creature that just took its turn, which it can see within 120 feet of it, calling it into battle by having the creature's own blood turn on it. At the start of the creature's next turn, the target may move on its turn toward the megataur by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet of it. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal, except it can't move away from the megataur willingly and can't teleport. If it doesn't choose to move this way, it takes 27 (5d10) force damage instead.
>
> **Check.** The megataur makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Lunging Grasp.** The megataur moves up to 25 feet and then may make a Fist attack against a creature that just took its turn.
>
> **Swallow.** The megataur uses the Swallow action.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If the megataur is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Megataur Loot
The valuable items looted from rat ogres will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
