## Rat Labs <br> (Player Level: 8-10)
In this encounter, the players break into a lab where wicked ratfolk are mutating rat ogres in giant vats, which will soon awaken and unleash their wrath. 

### Encounter Context
The players will have likely arrived here to stop the creation of the rat ogres. Upon their arrival, the ratfolk creating these monsters will accelerate their development in an attempt to rush them into combat. The players should be aware of the rat ogres in the vats and the threat they will soon pose.

### Lead Up
The ratfolk packmasters will be moving around the lab as they work. The room is guarded by an *alarm* spell that will alert the ratfolk to any intruders. Once the ratfolk are aware of the players' presence, each packmaster will attempt to reach a control panel and use an object interaction to increase the rate at which the rat ogres begin growing and mutating. They will only do this once they know the players have arrived, as the process of rapidly mutating the rat ogre will shatter the vat.


### The Growing Tanks
The rat ogres each start in a growing tank where they are unconscious and have total cover from any effects outside the tank, though creatures can still see them through the tank's glass.

At the start of combat, rat ogres all roll for initiative. If a ratfolk has activated the tanks, then at the end of each rat ogre's turn, roll a d6 for it to select a mutation it gains from the list below. If the result is a mutation it already has, it wakes up. 

Rat ogres also wake up early if their tank is destroyed. Each tank is an object with an AC 19, 30 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to thunder and lightning damage.


### Ratfolk Packmasters Tactics
&emsp;**Positioning.** Pack masters are frontline commanders who lead beasts and monstrous creatures into battle, maintaining close proximity to activate their Pack Leader trait. They use their pets strategically to form a barrier between themselves and the enemy, ensuring they can command from a position of relative safety.

**Combat Style.** Pack masters employ reach weapons to keep enemies at a distance, making use of their Pack Tactics to gain advantages on attacks and ensuring they can strike effectively while minimizing personal risk.

**Things Catcher.** This weapon allows pack masters to disrupt enemy formations by pulling foes away from their allies, and then directing their minions to surround and isolate the target, effectively cutting them off from support.

##### Rat Ogre Vat Effect
| d6  | Mutation |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Regeneration.*** The rat ogre regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the rat ogre takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the rat ogre's next turn. |
|  2  | ***Blood Fury.***  The rat ogre has advantage on melee attack rolls while it is berserk or under the effect of any storm charges. |
|  3  | ***Accelerated Movement.*** The rat ogre’s base speed increases to 60 feet. Additionally, while it is berserk or has a charge, its speed increases by an additional 20 feet, its Dexterity score becomes 20, it gains a +3 bonus to its AC (in addition to the bonus from Dex?), and it has advantage on Dexterity checks and saving throws. |
|  4  | ***Blade Arm.*** The damage for the rat ogre’s Claw attack increases by 13 (3d8) points of damage on a hit. |
|  5  | ***Nothing Happens.*** |
|  6  | ***The Rat Ogre Awakens.*** |

**Whip.** The whip is primarily a tool for controlling their beasts, and pack masters can use it to direct and organize their creatures during combat. However, the beasts themselves are typically relied upon for dealing damage.

**Retreat.** Pack Masters are known for their cautious approach in combat, quickly using their Scurry Away ability to retreat behind the safety of their beasts if threatened. If no beasts are available, they will attempt to flee the battlefield to avoid direct confrontation.

#### Packlord Tactics (Harder Encounter)
Packlords mostly use the same tactics as packmasters, with the primary difference being their mutagens.

**Mutagen Use.** Packlords enhance their battlefield capabilities by using Mutagens on themselves and their minions. They typically prioritize their most powerful minion for mutagen injections to maximize combat effectiveness, resorting to self-injection only when extremely vulnerable or cornered due to the risk of adverse effects.

### Aftermath
If the players flee, the ratfolk will wait to pursue them until all the rat ogres have awakened. The ratfolk are unlikely to flee so long as they still have rat ogres in the process of awakening. The rat ogres will fight to the death.


### XP Award: 8,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players slay all the ratfolk and rat ogres without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the ratfolk and rat ogres, but lose significant resources and/or multiple ratfolk escape to potentially alert reinforcements. 
* **50% XP:** The players eliminate at least half the rat ogres but flee before defeating the remainder.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating even half the rat ogres.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-7).** Remove the packmasters and rat ogres highlighted in red on the encounter map.<br> Change the XP award to 5,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 15-17).** Replace the packmasters highlighted in red on the map with packlords and replace all the rat ogres with rat ogre bone crushers.<br> Change the XP award to 25,000XP.

**Hardest Encounter (Level 20).** Replace all the packmasters with packlords and replace the rat ogres with mutant rat ogres.<Br> Change the XP award to 50,000XP.
