## The Assassin's Trap <br> (Player Levels: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players are charged with protecting a dwarven lord during his journey to a dwarven keep. As the players and the dwarf arrive at the keep, a trap is sprung by a ratfolk assassin and his squad or ratfolk death runner minions as they attempt to assassinate the dwarf. 


### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players are escorting a dwarven lord back to his keep. He has somehow become separated from his kin and has accepted the players' aid as he attempts to make it home in one piece. His dwarven companions may have been killed by ratfolk, leaving him well aware that he has been marked for death.

### Lead Up
Before they reach the hold, the dwarf will inform the players that its walls are warded to prevent teleportation magic from breaching their perimeter. However, teleportation can still be used within the confines of any given room. The walls also cannot be affected by magic that shapes stone and prevents creatures from moving through them by magical means. Only spells of 4th level or higher can overcome these wards.

When the dwarf reaches the front gate and sees no guards on duty, he speaks a command word, causing the gate to magically crank itself open. If the players inquire about this, he tells them that the ability to command the gates open is a privilege privy only to dwarven lords.

The players and the dwarf enter the apparently empty antechamber, which is illuminated by torches around the dwarven statues. When the dwarf reaches the center of the room, the gate everyone came through slams shut, the lights go out, and the ratfolk attack.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The entire room is illuminated in bright light when the players enter. But once the ratfolk spring their trap, the magically put out all the lights.
* **Statues.** The  statues stand 20 feet tall and can be climbed with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Pillars.** The room's pillars reach up to the ceiling and are too smooth to be climbed by ordinary means.
* **Gates.**  The metal gates at either end of the chamber are closed and prevent the use of teleportation magic through them. The gates have an AC 19 and a damage threshold of 10 (meaning attacks and effects that deal less than 10 damage do nothing to them). Dealing 27 damage to a single section creates a hole large enough for a Small creature to squeeze through. Dealing an additional 27 damage increases the size to allow a Medium creature to squeeze through. 
* **Gate Crank.** The cranks normally obey the commands of the dwarf lord and can be operated manually. However, they have been sabotaged by the ratfolk to magically lock themselves at their command.

##### Map Legend
* **A:** Ratfolk Assassin
* **D:** Ratfolk Death Runner

<Br>

An Intelligence (Investigation) check of 20 or higher of a crank before the trap is sprung will reveal it has been tampered with.
Once the trap is sprung, the magic that disabled the cranks is no longer present, and someone within 5 feet of a crank can use an action to make a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to disable the locks. Once the crank is unlocked, a creature can use an action to make a DC 12 Strength check to open the gate 5 feet. The gate crank shown on the map operates the lower gate the players came through. Another gate crank on the other side of the northern gate operates that gate and has been sabotaged the same way.<Br> The ratfolk do not need to make a check to unlock the cranks and can use them as an action, which they will do in order to flee.

<br>

> ##### Preparing Spells In Advance
> As stated in the Lead Up, players cannot use spells lower than 4th level to teleport out of the room, shape the stone of the interior, or move through the walls or gate. It may be helpful for players who prepare their spells at the start of the day to know this well in advance, so they can pick their spells appropriately.

### Encounter Tactics
The top priority of the ratfolk is killing the dwarf and escaping. The top priority of the dwarf is not being killed.

#### The Dwarf Lord
The dwarf has the stats of a veteran. He carries an amulet that grants him a +1 bonus to his AC, along with 100 temporary hit points at the start of each day. He will take the Dodge action each turn unless the players ask him to do otherwise. If he is reduced to 0 hp, he makes death saving throws as a PC would.

#### Ratfolk Ninja Assassin
The assassin will leap out and use his Assassinate and Sneak Attack abilities to attempt to do as much damage to the dwarf as possible within the first round of combat. After one or two rounds of combat, if the dwarf and the players are still high on health and fighting strong, the assassin will call for a retreat. If the dwarf is low on health or making death saving throws, it will try to stick around long enough to finish the job before escaping. If the dwarf is higher on health, but the players aren't fairing well, it may switch tactics to bring down the players to leave the dwarf without defenders. However, if the assassin is being focused on by players and is reduced to 25% health or less, it will flee regardless of how well the fight is going.

#### Ratfolk Death Runners
The pair of death runners exist primarily to support the assassin in killing the dwarf. This may involve helping to deal extra damage to the dwarf if they get an opening. However, given that the players are likely to focus their attention on the assassin, the death runners may also attack and harass the players to interfere with their ability to protect the dwarf. If the assassin is slain or calls for a retreat, the death runners will flee unless it looks like they could feasibly kill the dwarf within one round.

### Aftermath
If the players manage to protect the dwarf, he will undoubtedly be grateful for their aid and likely task them with hunting down the rest of the ratfolk behind this assassination attempt. The reason the dwarf is being targeted could be part of a much larger web of intrigue that spans an entire adventure or campaign, or it could be a simple grudge a particular clan of ratfolk have against this dwarf. 

If the dwarf is slain, his kin may come to the players and ask them to exact vengeance on those responsible for the assassination. 

Within a minute of the attack, dwarf guards of the hold will appear and raise the gates. As it turns out, the guards keeping watch at this gate were quietly slain by the ratfolk, and their bodies were hidden out of sight while the ratfolk laid their trap.

\columnbreak

#### Loot
If the players protect the life of the dwarf lord, he will generously repay them in coin. How much he pays them is at your discretion, though 10,000gp worth of coins and gems would be reasonable. He may offer the players additional rewards if they track down those who arranged his attempted assassination.

#### XP Award: 15,000xp
The degree of success the players have in protecting the dwarf lord can effect their XP award. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **Increase XP by 1/3:** The players slay all the ratfolk, and the dwarf never drops to 0 hit points.
* **Basline XP:** The assassin or both of the death runners escape, OR the dwarf drops to 0 hit points but doesn't die.
* **Decrease XP by 1/3:** The assassin or both of the death runners escape, AND the dwarf drops to 0 hit points but doesn't die.
* **Change XP to 1/3 of Baseline:** The dwarf is killed, but the players slay all the ratfolk.
* **Change XP to 1/10 of Baseline:** The dwarf is killed, and the assassin or both of the death runners escape.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter (Level 9-11).** Replace the ratfolk death runners with ratfolk gutter runners, and dwarf's amulet gives him 50 temporary hit points rather than 100. Change the XP award to 9,000xp.

**Harder Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace the ratfolk ninja assassin with a ratfolk master assassin, the death runners with death runners of renown, and dwarf's amulet gives him 150 temporary hit points rather than 100. Change the XP award to 18,000xp.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The dwarf (or his family) puts a bounty on the head of the ratfolk chieftain who ordered the assassination. |
|  2  | The dwarf was on his way to this hold to try to broker a peace treaty between their clans. The assassination attempt has heightened tensions as it remains unclear who orchestrated it. |
|  3  | The assassination attempt was being made as part of a larger invasion being planned against the dwarf hold. |
|  4  | The ratfolk make another assassination attempt against the dwarf, this time with the aid of a demonic vermin lord deceiver. |

## Encounter Creatures

### Ratfolk Death Runner

These ratfolk are the elite minions of their clans. Death runners either lead squads of gutter runners or form squads of their own when faced with situations that require the best of the best their clan has to offer. They utilize the same tactics as their gutter runner subordinates, but with a near-supernatural level of mastery. Death runners are often sent deep into enemy territory on what would be suicide missions for any other ratfolk. Here they eliminate high-value targets, steal the most precious of information, and unleash any other forms of mayhem their masters desire. Most importantly, death runners perform these tasks without leaving any trace of their presence. 

Death runners are also privy to some of the finest equipment their clans have to offer. They wield deadly blades dripping with poisons that can rapidly subdue even the hardiest of foes. Victims who are repeatedly subjected to their attacks find the toxins to become progressively more devastating, and death runners are brutally relentless when assaulting high-priority targets.

### Ratfolk Gutter Runner

Ratfolk who survive their dangerous apprenticeships as night runners can rise through the ranks of their clan to become deadly gutter runners. These ratfolk serve as special operations forces, carrying out covert missions that require their level of subtlety and skill. Gutter runner missions may include sabotage, espionage, or guerilla warfare. A gutter runner strike is often a prelude to a larger ratfolk attack, as they remove key enemy assets, destroy equipment, and weaken defenses to pave the way for a larger strike force.

When engaged in combat, gutter runners excel in hit-and-run attacks. Their near-supernatural agility allows them to dodge most attacks with ease, negating the need for armor. This lack of armor allows them to move quickly and operate as effective skirmishers. Gutter runners excel at hit-and-run style attacks, utilizing throwing stars to harry their foes before closing in for deadly strikes the moment they see an opening. Enemies find that trying to engage gutter runners directly is like grabbing at smoke, and they never strike the same way twice, constantly leaving opponents disoriented.

### Ratfolk Ninja Assassin

Those few ratfolk who manage to ascend through the ranks of their shadowy clan may eventually become dreaded assassins, representing the pinnacle of their deadly art. These dreaded killers carry out the most vital missions of their clan and usually hire their services out to other clans and even non-ratfolk. Assassins usually operate alone, carrying out operations that would be impossible for multiple ratfolk to accomplish. Killing important figures in heavily guarded locations, tracking the whereabouts of elusive individuals, and pilfering priceless information or artifacts are all within the prevue of an assassin. 

<br><br>

In times of war, assassins will often disguise as rank-and-file ratfolk, joining their kin in battle until they come within range of a high-value target. At that moment, the assassin springs forth dispatching foes with a whirl of poisoned blades, appearing as a blurred shadow as they deal death to their unprepared victims. At other times, assassins are tasked with sneaking behind enemy lines to slay dangerous but fragile targets, such as commanders, spellcasters, or weapon crews. Their speed and agility allow them to perform such strikes and retreat before their enemies can react to the attack.

#### Master Assassins
The most skilled assassins are given the title of Master, and it is said only thirteen such masters exist at any one time. These assassins possess a level of agility that surpasses that of nearly any mortal creature, making it almost impossible to land a meaningful strike on them. And any who attempt to do so will be mercilessly cut down by a flurry of poisoned attacks in the process. 

The skill of these assassins is such that their clan almost never makes their services available to outsiders and they are only assigned the most vital of missions. On the rare occasions that their clan must wage open war, their nimble forces are led by master assassins able to expertly direct their clan members and maximize their deadly potential.

> ***Scurry and Dodge.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, or the ratfolk is hit by an attack from a creature it can see, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition. If the ratfolk used this reaction in response to being hit by an attack, it takes only half the damage of that attack.

### Ninja Ratfolk Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. 

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. In the case of a ninja sorcerer, you may use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check instead. 


#### Ninja Ratfolk Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
