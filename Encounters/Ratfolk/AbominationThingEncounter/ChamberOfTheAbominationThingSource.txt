## Chamber of <Br> The Abomination Thing  <br> (Player Level: 15-17)
In this encounter, the players break into a massive ratfolk generator room to shut it down, only to inadvertently summon a gargantuan mutant rat defender.


### Encounter Context
The players will have likely arrived here to shut down the generator in an attempt to foil the schemes of the ratfolk. They likely won't know what awaits them once they attempt to shut down the generator.

### Running the Encounter
#### Initial Scene
* The party enters what appears to be an unguarded generator room.
* A DC 22 Arcana or Investigation check reveals the generator is indestructible and has a magical trap. It can only be destroyed after being properly shut down.

#### Trap Activation
* Tampering with the generator or unauthorized attempts to shut it down triggers electrical barriers at each room entrance. These barriers deal 16 (3d10) lightning damage to any creature passing through for the first time each turn or ending its turn there. The barriers block all projectiles and spells.

#### The Abomination Thing
* The Abomination Thing is summoned when the generator is tampered with. It appears at the safest point within the room from a pocket dimension.
* The generator remains protected and indestructible until the Dread Pit Abomination is defeated.
* Once the abomination is defeated, shutting down the generator requires five minutes of uninterrupted work.

#### Hex Cannons
* On initiative count 20 of each round (losing to ties), two hex cannons (selected at random) on the wall begin to crackle with electricity.
* On initiative count 20 of the next round, a bolt of green lightning shoots from each selected cannon to the coil in the center of the room. This line is 5 feet wide and affects any creature in its path.
* Affected creatures must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
* The cannons cease firing once the Abomination Thing is defeated.

### The Abomination Thing Tactics
The Abomination Thing is virtually incapable of employing coherent tactics. Its chaotic nature makes it difficult for even the most skilled of handlers to control it, and it is generally just directed in the direction of whatever enemies need slaying. However, when using its Hex Spasm legendary action, The Abomination Thing will try to get as close to the largest group of foes as possible before unleashing this unpredictable ability.

### Ratfolk Packmasters Tactics
&emsp;**Positioning.** The packlords use The Abomination Thing to form a barrier between themselves and the enemy, ensuring they can work from a position of relative safety.

**Combat Style.** Packlords employ reach weapons to keep enemies at a distance, making use of their Pack Tactics to gain advantages on attacks and ensuring they can strike effectively while minimizing personal risk.





<img src='https://i.ibb.co/PzDR4W4/Thing-Thing-Guide.jpg' style='position:absolute; top:85px; right:2px; width:420px; ' />

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;**Things Catcher.** This weapon allows pack masters to disrupt enemy formations by pulling foes away from their allies, and then directing their minions to surround and isolate the target, effectively cutting them off from support.

**Mutagen Use.** The packlords will prioritize enhancing The Abomination Thing with their mutagens, resorting to self-injection only when extremely vulnerable or cornered due to the risk of adverse effects.

### Ending The Encounter
If the players flee the encounter, The Abomination Thing will be teleported back to its pocket dimension, and the trap will reset. The Abomination Thing will gain all the benefits of a long rest while in the pocket dimension.

### XP Award: 25,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players slay all the ratfolk and rat ogres without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the ratfolk and rat ogres, but lose significant resources and/or multiple ratfolk escape to potentially alert reinforcements. 
* **50% XP:** The players eliminate at least half the rat ogres but flee before defeating the remainder.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating even half the rat ogres.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 10-12).** Replace The Abomination Thing with a dread pit abomination. <br> Change the XP award to 12,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Add 2 ratfolk packlords which appear right next right next to The Abomination Thing. <br> Change the XP award to 45,000XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Power Vacuum:** Shutting down the generator destabilizes the power being provided to ratfolk, which triggers a civil war among different factions. |
|  2  | **The Escaped Experiments:** With the generator down, other mutant defenses around the area may begin to fail, releasing monsters into the wild. The adventurers could be hired to track down and neutralize these threats before they wreak havoc on nearby settlements. |
|  3  | **The Primordial Power Source:** The generator was powering more than just the ratfolk's city; it was also suppressing an ancient evil that it used as its power source. With the generator offline, this force is beginning to stir, and the adventurers must secure or destroy it before it becomes a greater threat.   |
|  4  | **Collapsing Complex:** The generator is beginning to self-destruct, forcing the players to make their escape to the surface. All through their escape, they must contend with unstable and collapsing structures, exploding machinery, panicking ratfolk, and rampaging monsters.  |

### Dread Pit Abomination Loot
The valuable items looted from dread pit abominations will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Dread Pit Abomination Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

### Ratfolk Packmasters Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. 

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. In the case of a ninja sorcerer, you may use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check instead. 


#### Ratfolk Packmasters Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
