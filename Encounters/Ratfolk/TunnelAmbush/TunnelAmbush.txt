## Drill Team Ambush<br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this encounter, the players are traveling through a tunnel where they are ambushed by teams of ratfolk bursting through the walls using their burrowing warp grinder weapons.

### Encounter Context
This encounter doesn't require much context and could even be a random encounter that occurs while the players are traveling underground. The players may or may not be aware of ratfolk in the area and may be on a mission related to combating them.



### Lead Up
The ratfolk are aware of the players' location as they move through the tunnel and are drilling through the rock to prepare their ambush. A creature with a Passive Perception of 19 or higher will hear or feel the ratfolk drilling and be aware of where they are about to burst through the wall one turn before they do so. A creature with a Passive Perception of 15 or higher will sense activity in the rock but not know exactly what or where it is.

### Map Description
* **Main Tunnel.** The tunnel the players are traveling through is 20 feet high and has no lighting beyond what the players provide.
* **Burrowed Tunnels.** The tunnels burrowed by the ratfolk are much smaller and just large enough for Medium creatures to squeeze through, though ratfolk can move through them unimpeded using their Crevise Crawler trait.


### Running the Encounter
The encounter will begin either when the players detect the ratfolk coming or the ratfolk burst through the walls can catch them by surprise. If the players detect the ratfolk early, they will have 1 turn to prepare and will not be surprised when the ratfolk attack.

Once the ratfolk make their attack, they will attempt to surround the players and come at them from all sides. Underground environments are familiar to them, and ambushes are their preferred form of attack, so the ratfolk will stick to their standard combat tactics, described in the reference material for this encounter.


### Aftermath
If the players manage to flee through the tunnels, the ratfolk will pursue them if possible. If the players manage to escape, the ratfolk will likely burrow back into the tunnels and try to track the players down to spring another ambush before they have the chance to rest and recover.

<br>

If the ratfolk are losing and attempt to flee, they do so through the tunnels they burrowed, where pursuit by the players will be more difficult. Once they get some distance, they will try to collapse the tunnel behind them if they have a warp grinder on hand, burying pursuers and preventing them from being followed.

#### Loot
If this is a random encounter that's part of the players' travels, there's no need to provide treasure beyond what they can loot from the ratfolk (see the loot guides in the reference material.) 

If this encounter is part of a larger underground adventure and you which to provide an extra treasure reward, you can have each warp grinder embedded with 1d4 warp gems worth 100gp each.

#### XP Award: 13,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players slay all the ratfolk without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the ratfolk, but lose significant resources and/or multiple ratfolk escape to potentially alert reinforcements. 
* **50% XP:** The players eliminate at least half the ratfolk but flee before defeating the remainder.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating even half the ratfolk.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 7-9).** Replace the clan rats with ratfolk slaves and the veteran weapon operators with standard weapon operators. Remove the Seismic Snare upgrade from the warp grinders. <br>If you're adding gems to the Warp Grinders to provide additional treasure, change them to each have 2d6 embedded Warp Stones worth 10gp each.<br> Change the XP award to 7,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 12-14).** Replace the clan rats with volcanic slashers and the warp grinders with earth rippers that don't have any upgrades.<br> If you're adding gems to the Warp Grinders to provide additional treasure, change them to each have 1d4 embedded Flawless Warp Gems worth 200gp each.<br> Change the XP award to 15,000XP.

**Hardest Encounter (Level 14-16).** Replace the clan rats with storm vermin and the warp grinders with earth rippers that still have the Seismic Snare upgrade.<Br> If you're adding gems to the Warp Grinders to provide additional treasure, change them to each have 1d4 embedded Warp Jewels worth 1,000gp each.<Br> Change the XP award to 20,000XP.

# Encounter Reference Material


## Two-Creature Weapon Rules
Two-creature weapons require at least two creatures to operate them, and they come with the following additional rules considerations:


### The Weapons Team
The two creatures operating a two-creature weapon are known as the weapons team. The weapons team consists of a leader and a follower. Only one creature can be assigned to each role, and they cannot switch roles once assigned, even if one of the roles becomes vacant, unless they leave the weapons team and rejoin.

#### Joining a Weapons Team

Joining a two-creature weapons team costs a creature's action and half of its movement as it equips its part of the weapon. If one creature is already part of the weapons team, it may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature joining the team. Leaving a weapon team requires no action as the creature drops its part of the weapon.

A creature must have both hands available to be on a weapons team and can't pick anything else up without dropping its part of the weapon.

The creatures within a weapons team must stay within 5 feet of each other and the weapon at all times. If one of them is ever more than 5 feet away from the weapon or the other team member, it is no longer part of the team. 

#### Moving Two-Creature Weapons
The follower can no longer move on its turn except to leave the weapons team. The leader's speed becomes equal to the lowest speed among the creatures on the weapons team. Whenever the leader moves, it can choose to move the follower along with it if the follower is willing, even when the leader is moved against its will. 

#### Stealth
While part of a weapons team, a creature has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Additionally, activating a two-creature weapon reveals the weapons team's location if they are hidden.



### Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Two-Creature <br> Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning two-creature weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Actions station
By default, weapons can have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by creatures on their weapons teams. The Load and Crank functions <br> can be activated by the follower, and the Fire <br> function can be activated by the leader. Each <br> function can only be activated once per round. 

#### Load
This function is used by the follower to reload <br> the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. <br> It requires the follower to have immediate <br> access to the weapon's ammunition, and <br> creatures can use their reaction to make <br> opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits <br> the follower this way, it drops the ammo and <br> wastes its action.

#### Crank
Not all weapons have this function. If a weapon <br> does, it must be activated by the follower before <br> each use of the Fire function to move the ammo <br> or fuel through the weapon.

\pagebreakNum





#### Fire
The function is activated by the leader to fire the <br> weapon. When this function is activated, but before <br> its effect occurs, roll to see if a Mishap occurs.

 If a Mishap occurs, its effects happen before the effects of the Fire. This function can't be used if the weapon is out of ammo or if the weapon has a Crank function that hasn't been used since the weapon was last loaded or fired.

### Mishaps
Mishaps represent the weapon experiencing a significant malfunction. There is always a risk of this when firing the weapon, and some weapons have other circumstances that risk a mishap. Whenever this risk occurs, roll a d6. On a result of 1, a Mishap occurs, and the creature who triggered it must roll on the weapon's Mishap Table to determine the nature of this malfunction (see the Mishap Table section).

If the weapon has less than half its hit points, roll 2d6 and take the lowest result when checking for a mishap. 

Unless stated otherwise, you must always check for a mishap when activating the Fire function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Most weapons have a Mishaps Table, which describes different ways their functionality can go awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishap Table.

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

\pagebreakNum

#### Warp Grinder Upgrades

You can apply any of the following upgrades to a warp grinder. Doing so increases its CR by 1 per upgrade applied.


**Seismic Snare.** When a creature fails the saving throw against the weapon's Fire function and is standing on earth or stone, it becomes buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature is restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a Strength check against the weapon's DC. This check has advantage if the creature making it has a burrow speed.

**Emboldening Fumes.** When the Fire function is used, each creature that is part of the weapons team gains 10 temporary hit points at the end of the turn. While a creature has these temporary hit points, it is poisoned and immune to being frightened or charmed. A creature immune to the poisoned condition cannot gain these temporary hit points. If the weapon's safety protocol has been overridden, the team gains 20 temporary hit points instead. If the weapon has a Mishap, they gain 30 temporary hit points instead.

**Warp-Quake.** Whenever a creature fails its saving throw against the weapon's Fire function while standing on difficult terrain created by any warp-grinder within the last minute, it takes an extra 13(2d12) plus 9(2d8) thunder damage.

#### Warp Grinder Tactics

The warp grinder weapons teams expertly lead ratfolk in subterranean ambushes and serve as formidable shock troopers.

The warp grinder should be part of preplanned ambush teams, bursting from the ground to surprise enemies. However, the emergence point might be slightly random due to the difficulty of pinpoint precision during emergence. Note that the tunnels may require Medium creatures to squeeze through for traversal, except for ratfolk, who can easily navigate them with their Crevice Crawler feature.




To determine if the warp grinder surprises enemies, have the weapons team carrying it perform Stealth checks. The team should override the safety protocol to move at maximum speed just before reaching the surface, preventing enemies from preparing for battle if they notice the incoming attack.

Upon surfacing, the team targets the nearest high-armor and low-dexterity enemy with the weapons Fire ability. If they can hit multiple targets without causing too much harm to friendly forces, they will override the safety protocol and use the area-of-effect version of the Fire ability. This will provide advantage to attacking allies if the targets are knocked prone. The difficult terrain created by this ability can also facilitate escape or hinder enemy reinforcements.

The burrowing ability remains useful even after surfacing. It allows the weapons team to move through the difficult terrain they create, avoid movement penalties, dig underground to dodge ranged attacks, and escape against Medium-sized creatures more easily.

\columnbreak

##### Warp Grinder Upgrade Tactics
&emsp;**Seismic Snare.** This upgrade enhances the warp grinder's debuffing capability, making it an excellent choice when teaming up with groups of ratfolk.

**Emboldening Fumes.** This upgrade empowers the warp grinder to be far more daring. Those affected by the fumes will never flee from battle.

**Warp-Quake.** This upgrade turns the team into masters of area denial. The safety protocol should be overridden whenever this feature is used. If there are no targets on difficult terrain, the team should spend its turn spreading as much difficult terrain as possible.






### Warp Grinder Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these weapons are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Warp Grinder Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Ratfolk Loot Guide
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying what goods are truly valuable items, not just trinkets they were trying to pretend were impressive status symbols.

#### Lootable Ratfolk Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Ratfolk Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Warlock Engineer Items |  Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence Check With Appropriate Tools |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. As ratfolk are quick to horde anything they might see as valuable, the difficulty in looting ratfolk often stems from sorting out actual valuables from items that have simply been made to appear valuable. 

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, a Monstrous Bone may be worth 10gp, but a Pristine Monstrous Bone would be worth 20gp, and a Cracked Monstrous Bone would be worth 5gp. Gems may be flawed, hide might be tattered, and metal corroded, cutting their value in half, and any item in pristine condition can be worth twice as much. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort.


##### Example Generic Ratfolk Item Names
| Value  | Bone | Gem | Hide | Metal |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1gp |  Rat Bone |  Green Quartz  | Leather Scraps | Blade Fragment |
|  10gp| Monstrous Bone |  Warp Stone  | Armored Leather | Intact Blade |

#### Loot Tables

### Ratfolk Tactics
Ratfolk rarely have the advantage over their foes in terms of individual power and must instead rely upon cunning and numbers. Grand strategic goals are pursued using deception, betrayal, and securing large numbers of allies. Ratfolk are opportunistic schemers by nature and can flip from cowering hesitation to brutal aggression the moment they see an opening to pursue their goals. Though ratfolk are quick to backstab one another to pursue their ends, they naturally unite into overwhelming verminous mobs when faced with an outside threat. These tactics carry over into how ratfolk engage the players in combat.




#### Engagement
Ratfolk rarely engage enemies on anything approaching even footing. They don’t start a fight unless they’ve caught the players off-guard, have overwhelming numbers, or have a terrain advantage. If they’re able, ratfolk will surround the players before making their presence known using their natural stealthiness. They will also try to fight in dark and claustrophobic environments where their darkvision and Crevice Crawler abilities allow them to sneak up from unexpected directions.


#### Combat

So long as they believe they have the upper hand, ratfolk are vicious combatants to the point of recklessness. They will dogpile an isolated or otherwise vulnerable opponent and utilize their Overwhelming Mass feature to rack up brutal amounts of damage. If the players manage to regroup to support whoever is being ganged up on, the ratfolk will scatter using their Scurry Away feature before rallying to reattempt the same tactic. Fighting in an environment with tight spaces the players can’t easily move through helps facilitate this fighting style.


#### Retreat
Ratfolk aren’t shy about retreating if a fight doesn’t appear to be going well. If ratfolk force as a whole is doing well, individual ratfolk will often fight to the death. However, their morale plummets once they no longer perceive themselves as having the upper hand. This may happen if the ratfolk lose more than half their fighting force or their leader is slain, and their enemies don’t appear to be near defeat. Under these circumstances, most ratfolk will flee if they have lost at least half their health, face a foe they don’t outnumber, or see multiple nearby allies flee.
