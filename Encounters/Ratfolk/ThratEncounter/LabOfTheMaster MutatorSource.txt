## Lab of The <Br> Master Mutator <br> (Player Level: 15-17)
In this encounter, the players break into the dread ratfolk laboratory of Thrat, The Foul, for a showdown against him and his horrific creations.

### Encounter Context
This encounter will work best as the final battle of an adventure. Thrat is a dangerous foe, and even more so in his lab. So, this will make for a good climactic finish to an adventure where he's the antagonist.

### Lead Up
Thrat will be moving around the lab as he works. The room is guarded by an *alarm* spell that will alert him to any intruders. Once he is aware of the players' presence, he will release a screech, awakening the creeping experiments in the vats throughout his lab.


### Experimental Vats

Each vat is a large magical object with an Armor Class (AC) of 16 and 60 hit points. On initiative count 20 (losing ties), each vat spawns a **creeping experiment** with a random Experimental Attack. These experiments take their turns immediately after spawning. Each vat can spawn a maximum number five experiments, enhancing the complexity and dynamics of the encounter.


### Thrat, The Foul Tactics

**Minion Dependency:** Thrat constantly requires a supply of minions to command and consume to stave off his Ravening Hunger.

#### Attacks
**Creature-Killer:** Used when not grappling a target. This attack grants advantage to Thrat and his minions for future attacks, and should target foes with large hit dice and low AC.
Ravening 

**Bite:** Employed at least once each round to prevent the activation of Ravening Hunger. Target restrained creatures or consume corpses with beneficial mutations.

**Whip of Domination:** Primarily used with his Surge of Cruelty legendary action unless he is consuming a corpse or restraining a target with Creature-Killer.

#### Creeping Experiments Tactics
**Target Selection:** Thrat uses his mutagen ability to enhance creatures in the best position to wreak havoc on the players.

**Acid Smear:** Used if the opponent has high AC or can impose disadvantage on attack rolls.

**Withering Touch:** Used if the opponent relies heavily on weapon attacks.

**Electrical Surge:** Employed against opponents who benefit significantly from bonus actions, such as monks or rogues.

**Flailing Limbs:** Used against opponents with lower than usual AC.

### Rat Ogre Tactics
Rat ogres are tormented and unnatural creatures with no tactical awareness or regard for their safety. Without the guidance of a pack master or other intelligent leaders, they mindlessly attack the nearest targets. When commanded by more intelligent masters, they serve as shock cavalry, overwhelming weaker foes with brute force.

#### Rat Ogre Mutant Tactics
Rat ogre mutants possess a Sweep attack that allows them to deal significant damage to clusters of enemies. If guided by more intelligent creatures, these mutants are directed toward groups to maximize their destructive potential.


### Ending The Encounter
If the players flee the encounter, Thrat will likely gather his forces and pursue them. If he realizes he's going to lose the fight, he may try to use his experiments to stall the players as he makes his escape. Alternatively, the contents of his lab may be so valuable to him that he dies fighting.

If the players defeat Thrat, award them 30,000 XP.

### New Magic Item: Mutagen
*Potion, rare, 400gp*

This crude syringe is filled with a thick green sludge, ready to be injected into those who dare to risk its potent effects.

As a bonus action, you can inject this mutagen into a willing or incapacitated creature, which gains one of the following random effects, determined by rolling a d4; these effects can stack if multiple doses are administered, and each lasts for 1 minute:

##### Mutagen Effect
| d4  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------:|
 |  1  | ***Rapid Healing.***  The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. Additionally, it has advantage on Constitution saving throws. |
 |  2  | ***Rapid Grow.***  The creature becomes one size larger. If there isn’t enough space to grow, its size doesn't change. While one size larger, it has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and its attacks with weapons or unarmed strikes deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage.|
 |  3  | ***Rapid Acceleration.*** The creature's speed increases by 30 feet, and its movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. It also has advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. |
|  4  | ***Rapid Degeneration.*** At the end of each of its turns, the creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the creature dies from this effect, it explodes, and each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. |


\columnbreak

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 12-14).** Change the experimental tanks so they each only create a creeping experiment on the 1st and 3rd rounds of combat.<br> Change the XP award to 14,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Add 2 mutant rat ogres to the encounter.<br> Change the XP award to 60,000XP.


### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Escapee from the Depths:** The adventurers encounter a creature that has escaped from Thrat’s lab. This creature, although dangerous, possesses intelligence and memories of the horrors within the lab. It begs the adventurers to stop Thrat before he can finalize his most terrifying creation yet.  |
|  2  | **Unnatural Disturbances:** Local wildlife has begun exhibiting strange and aggressive behaviors, attacking nearby settlements. Investigation reveals that these mutations are the result of Thrat’s experiments leaking into the environment, pointing the adventurers toward his lab for answers.
|  3  | **An Unlikely Alliance:** The players are approached by a rival ratfolk packlord Thrat, offering an alliance. This uneasy cooperation could provide additional resources and information but at the cost of trusting a dubious ally who has their own motives.   |
|  4  | **The Collector’s Request:** A mysterious collector who specializes in oddities and forbidden knowledge hires the adventurers to retrieve a unique specimen from Thrat’s latest batch of creations. This mission could serve as a cover for the adventurers to infiltrate the lab and confront Thrat directly.  |

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
> * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.

### Thrat, The Foul Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. 

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. In the case of a ninja sorcerer, you may use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check instead. 


#### Thrat, The Foul Loot Tables
The following table describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Rat Ogre Loot
The valuable items looted from rat ogres will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Rat Ogre Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.
