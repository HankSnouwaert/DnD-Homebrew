## Dr. Skitterboom's <br>Rocket of Doom <br> (Player Level: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players delve into the lair of a mad ratfolk scientist who's about to launch an arcane rocket capable of untold destruction. The players must overcome the ratfolk and his minions to disable the rocket before its launch countdown reaches zero. 


### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players know of Skitterboom's plans and have made their way to his lair to stop the rocket launch. This encounter makes for a good finale to a dungeon where the players make their way through his hideout to reach the chamber where the rocket is being launched.


### Lead Up
There is only one entrance into the chamber, and there is no cover for the players to hide behind to try to enter stealthily without the aid of magic. As soon as the ratfolk realize the players have arrived, they will rush to launch the rocket earlier than planned, and the first one able to reach the rocket's control panel with its movement will do so and use an action to start the launch sequence. 

### Map Description
* **The Rocket.** The rocket has an AC 21 and 250 HP. The rocket launches 5 rounds after the launch sequence is activated. Once it launches, it travels at a speed of 300 ft. per round along the rails and through the tunnel off the right side of the map before eventually leaving the lair and flying toward its target. It is a magical object and ignores all magical barriers when it launches.<br>
If the rocket detonates, every creature within 500 feet of it must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 20d6 radiant damage and 20d6 fire damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a success.

* **The Control Panel** Ratfolk within 5 feet of the control panel can activate the rocket's launch sequence as an action, which will cause it to launch 5 rounds later. Creatures within 5 feet of the control panel can use an action to attempt to abort the launch by making a DC 16 Intelligence (Tinker's Tools) check. Players who have attempted this check once before have advantage on it. <br>
If the launch is aborted, it can be started again using the control panel, though the sequence will start back at 5 rounds.<br>
A creature can rush the check, making it as a bonus action. When making the skill check while rushing, the creature must roll a d6. On a result of 1 or 2, the rocket's launch will be aborted, but it will also begin a self-destruct sequence and detonate after 5 rounds unless a creature succeeds on the same control panel skill check to stop it (ratfolk automatically succeed this check.)

<Br>


* **The Power Core.** The rocket's power core is a metallic orb of an unknown substance and provides the energy that activates its thrusters and is the source of its explosive power. It is a Small object with AC 12 and 30 hit points, and any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of it while it is not in the rocket takes 2d6 (7) radiant damage. If it is reduced to 0 hit points, or the rocket is reduced to 0 hit points while the power core is embedded in it, the power core begins collapsing in on itself and will detonate after 1 minute creating the same effect as the rocket's detonation.<Br>
The power core sits atop the rocket, embedded in its chassis, and a creature able to reach it can make a DC 16 Strength check to attempt to pull it out. Alternatively, a creature holding it can use an action to lock it back into the rocket. If removed, any ongoing launch sequence is canceled and can't be started again until it is returned to the rocket.

### Running the Encounter
When the battle starts, it should be made clear to the players that the control panel activated the rocket's launch and seems to control its operation. The power core also gives off an eerie glow that will be obvious to the players and potentially clue them to its importance. The players should also be aware of how much time there is to the rocket's launch, either via a dramatic automated voice doing the countdown or a launch clock ticking down.

The ratfolk will fight using most of the general tactics described later in this document. Skitterboom will target creatures that seem most likely to disable the rocket with his heavy firepower. The bombardiers will do their best to make approaching the rocket difficult, using poison gas clouds to make movement hazardous, and the infantry will try to body-block players. 

### Aftermath
If the players flee the lair, the ratfolk won't pursue them and will focus on ensuring the launch continues unless the rocket has been rendered inoperable or the power core is about to self-destruct and is still in the lair, in which case, the ratfolk will pursue the players.

The ratfolk won't flee unless it is clear they can't achieve a launch and are losing the battle.


#### Loot
After the battle, the players will be able to loot Skitterboom's chamber for all its valuable materials. Because this battle is likely to be the final encounter of an adventure, it would be a good time to award the players one or two treasure hoards of the appropriate level.

#### XP Award: 13,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players stop the rocket launch and slay or capture Skitterboom.
* **100% XP:** The players stop the rocket launch, but Skitterboom escapes. 
* **50% XP:** The players fail to stop the rocket launch but manage to slay or capture Skitterboom.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without stopping the rocket or slaying Skitterboom.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 7-9).** Replace the death globe bombardiers with poisoned wind globadiers and the storm vermin with clan rants. Reduce the DCs of encounter's skill checks to 16. Change the XP award to 6,000 XP.

\columnbreak



**Harder Encounter (Level 15-17).** Change Skitterdoom to a warlock master and give him a Brass Orb in addition to his existing weapons. Increase the DCs of encounter's skill checks to 20. Give the death globe bombardiers the Acid Blast upgrade. Change the XP award to 22,000 XP.ddtion to his existing weapons. Give the death globe bombardiers the Acid Blast upgrade. Change the XP award to 22,000 XP.






### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Merely a Pawn:** With Dr. Skitterboom defeated, the players discover cryptic documents and plans in his lair that hint at a larger conspiracy. It becomes apparent that the rocket of doom was just one piece of a grander scheme orchestrated by a secretive and malevolent force. The adventurers must delve deeper into the mysterious plot, piecing together clues, and following the trail of corruption to unveil the true mastermind behind Dr. Skitterboom's actions. |
|  2  | **Skitterboom's Pact:** The defeat of Dr. Skitterboom reveals his affiliation with a dark and powerful demonic entity that provided him with the knowledge needed for the rocket's construction. The players become entangled in a dangerous web of contracts and forbidden pacts, discovering that the rocket of doom was meant to fulfill a dark bargain.  |
|  3  | **The Lost Laboratory:** The defeat of Dr. Skitterboom leads the players to discover an abandoned laboratory hidden deep within the underground. Here, they uncover the remnants of the warlock engineer's experiments, including forbidden research on warp technology and the rocket of doom. As they investigate further, they stumble upon a dormant, highly advanced prototype of the rocket, which poses a new threat. The players must decide whether to dismantle the prototype, safeguard it from falling into the wrong hands, or potentially repurpose it for good, all while dealing with the laboratory's defenses and unexpected experiments which have activated. |
|  4  | **Warp Secrets:** The thwarted rocket launch piques the interest of various factions seeking to gain knowledge of warp technology and its applications. The players find themselves at the center of a race to secure this coveted knowledge, with powerful entities offering rewards or threats to obtain it. The adventurers must carefully navigate the treacherous waters of political intrigue and espionage, all while making critical decisions about the fate of the powerful secrets they possess. |

### Forbidden Devices

Ratfolk warlock engineers possess a unique arsenal of magic items specifically designed for use against their adversaries. A warlock engineer can select two items, while a Warlock Master can select three from the list below. They can choose the same device more than once. Each device requires an action to use and can't be used again until the warlock has had time to rebuild it using Smith's Tools during a long rest.


#### Brass Orb (Warlock Master Only)
This fist-sized metal orb made of interlocking whirling cogs is a dangerous device capable of causing a momentary tear in reality.

If the ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can throw the device at a point it can see within 30 feet. The brass orb detonates at this point, and each creature within 15 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) force damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) force damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If this damage reduces a target to 20 hit points or fewer and it failed the saving throw, it is banished to another plane of existence of the DM's choice.

When the ratfolk attempts to throw the brass orb, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the ratfolk this way, it drops the brass orb, which detonates at its location.


#### Doom Rocket
When launched, this missile shrieks through the air before striking the ground and unleashing a wave of bright, glowing green light that irradiates anything near the impact site.

The ratfolk cannot use this device if it is restrained or grappled. When the ratfolk uses the Doom Rocket, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and launches it at a point it can see within 120 feet. 

<br>

> ##### Alternate Weapon: Warpmusket
>You can replace the Warlock Pistol and Warp Blade of any warlock engineer or warlock master with a Warpmusket, which it can use with the following action.
>
> **Warpmusket.** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, (range 150/450), one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) radiant damage. If the ratfolk rolls a 3 or lower on the attack roll, the attack automatically misses as the musket malfunctions and the ratfolk takes the attack damage. A fired musket must be reloaded using an action before it can be fired again. 
>
> If a warlock master is using the weapon, it instead gets +9 to hit and deals 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) radiant damage on hit.


\columnbreak

The rocket detonates at this point, and each creature within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) radiant damage plus an additional 5 (1d10) radiant damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When the ratfolk attempts to launch the rocket, creatures can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it. If a creature hits the ratfolk in this way, the rocket misfires and detonates at its location.

#### Earth Render

This mechanized spike jackhammers into the ground, creating a localized earthquake capable of reducing the structures of surface dwellers into rubble.

When the ratfolk uses the Earth Render, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and rams the device into the ground, creating violent tremors. Each creature in a 25-foot cube originating from the ratfolk must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage plus an additional 3 (1d6) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. Structures in the area take double damage from the effect.


#### Warp Lighting Generator
This strange metallic device hums with power before emitting a tremendous bolt of green lightning.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Lightning Generator, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and hurls a magical green lightning bolt at a point it can see within 100 feet. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) lightning damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become unable to take reactions until the start of its next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its reaction.
 


 
#### Warp Fume Sprayer
This device's canister contains toxic gases that can be expelled in a wave through a large, rusty nozzle. 

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Fume Sprayer, it expends all its eldritch energy levels and sprays toxic fumes in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 9 (2d8) poison damage plus an additional 5 (1d8) poison damage for each eldritch energy level the ratfolk expended and become poisoned until the start of the ratfolk's next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned.


#### Warp Scorcher
This arm-mounted flamethrower spews lines of flames that cling to anything in their path.

When the ratfolk uses the Warp Scorcher, it expends all its eldritch energy levels to unleash a gout of flame 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in the direction of its choice. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (3d8) fire damage plus an additional 4 (1d8) for each energy level the ratfolk expended and be set on fire. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't set on fire. A creature that's been set on fire this way takes 9 (2d8) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until a creature uses an action to douse the fire.

>
> When ratfolk attempts to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against it as though ratfolk moved out of their reach. If a creature hits the ratfolk this way, it drops the globe, and it shatters at it's location.

> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn.

This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

#### Poisoned Wind Globes
___
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Poisoned wind globes are orbs made of glass or crystal and filled with deadly gas. When shattered, the spheres release billowing toxic clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.

>
> ***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage.
>
> ***Death Globe (3/day).*** If ratfolk is not restrained or grappled, it can hurl the globe at a point it can see within 30 feet. The globe shatters at this point, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 10-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
>
> When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 16 (3d8 + 3) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

#### Death Globes
___
- **Cost:** 100 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Death globes are built with the same function as poisoned wind globes, but the gasses they carry are far more potent and capable of enveloping a much larger area.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 10-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.

#### Poisoned Wind Globe & Death Globe Upgrades

These effects can be added to poisoned wind globes or death globes to enhance their lethality. The cost of the globe is increased by 100 gold per upgrade added. If they're added to the globes used ratfolk poisoned wind globadiers or ratfolk death globe bombardiers, their CR goes up by 1 per <br>upgrade applied to their globes.

* **Acid Blast.** When the orb shatters at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the orb's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (This orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

\pagebreakNum

* **Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the orb deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

* **Warp Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the orb, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

### Ratfolk Loot Guide
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying what goods are truly valuable items, not just trinkets they were trying to pretend were impressive status symbols.

#### Lootable Ratfolk Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Ratfolk Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Warlock Engineer Items |  Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence Check With Appropriate Tools |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. As ratfolk are quick to horde anything they might see as valuable, the difficulty in looting ratfolk often stems from sorting out actual valuables from items that have simply been made to appear valuable. 

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, a Monstrous Bone may be worth 10gp, but a Pristine Monstrous Bone would be worth 20gp, and a Cracked Monstrous Bone would be worth 5gp. Gems may be flawed, hide might be tattered, and metal corroded, cutting their value in half, and any item in pristine condition can be worth twice as much. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort.


##### Example Generic Ratfolk Item Names
| Value  | Bone | Gem | Hide | Metal |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1gp |  Rat Bone |  Green Quartz  | Leather Scraps | Blade Fragment |
|  10gp| Monstrous Bone |  Warp Stone  | Armored Leather | Intact Blade |

### Ratfolk Tactics
Ratfolk rarely have the advantage over their foes in terms of individual power and must instead rely upon cunning and numbers. Grand strategic goals are pursued using deception, betrayal, and securing large numbers of allies. Ratfolk are opportunistic schemers by nature and can flip from cowering hesitation to brutal aggression the moment they see an opening to pursue their goals. Though ratfolk are quick to backstab one another to pursue their ends, they naturally unite into overwhelming verminous mobs when faced with an outside threat. These tactics carry over into how ratfolk engage the players in combat.




#### Engagement
Ratfolk rarely engage enemies on anything approaching even footing. They don’t start a fight unless they’ve caught the players off-guard, have overwhelming numbers, or have a terrain advantage. If they’re able, ratfolk will surround the players before making their presence known using their natural stealthiness. They will also try to fight in dark and claustrophobic environments where their darkvision and Crevice Crawler abilities allow them to sneak up from unexpected directions.


#### Combat

So long as they believe they have the upper hand, ratfolk are vicious combatants to the point of recklessness. They will dogpile an isolated or otherwise vulnerable opponent and utilize their Overwhelming Mass feature to rack up brutal amounts of damage. If the players manage to regroup to support whoever is being ganged up on, the ratfolk will scatter using their Scurry Away feature before rallying to reattempt the same tactic. Fighting in an environment with tight spaces the players can’t easily move through helps facilitate this fighting style.


#### Retreat
Ratfolk aren’t shy about retreating if a fight doesn’t appear to be going well. If ratfolk force as a whole is doing well, individual ratfolk will often fight to the death. However, their morale plummets once they no longer perceive themselves as having the upper hand. This may happen if the ratfolk lose more than half their fighting force or their leader is slain, and their enemies don’t appear to be near defeat. Under these circumstances, most ratfolk will flee if they have lost at least half their health, face a foe they don’t outnumber, or see multiple nearby allies flee.

#### Poisoned Wind Globadier Tactics  
The poisoned wind globadiers play a crucial role in disrupting enemy groups by acting as debuffers and providing cover for their army. They achieve this by deploying poison gas clouds to blind their opponents. While they are resistant effects of the poison wind orbs they handle, they still exercise caution. Close combat is avoided, as any melee attack could accidentally shatter the orbs before they are thrown. To prevent such mishaps, they prefer to keep at least 30 feet from their targets while hurling the orbs, employing the Devious Globadier ability to maintain this distance effectively.

When an opponent is severely injured and poisoned, and the globadiers have numerical superiority, they may decide to move in and switch to dagger attacks.

It's important that other ratfolk avoid close proximity to poisoned wind globadiers due to the fear of a globe accidentally shattering. Even when fighting in a group, multiple poisoned wind globadiers spread out from each other, converging only when preparing to engage in melee combat.


#### Warlock Engineer Tactics
Warlock engineers, along with master engineers, are extremely intelligent ratfolk who delight in testing their diabolical weaponry on players. In combat, their primary objective is to eliminate as many targets as possible using their advanced artillery, often disregarding the casualties of their own minions caught in the crossfire.

Warlock engineers possess a versatile arsenal, including ranged attacks, area of effect damage, and some melee capabilities. When using a vehicle, they can also serve as cavalry units, making their tactical approach highly adaptable. Their power output each turn depends on their eldritch power level.

**Initiation.** At the start of combat, the engineer will attempt to fire its pistol, reload as a bonus action, and fire again, maximizing damage against a target surrounded by minions.

**Closing In.** The warlock engineer can also utilize its warp blade, which consumes eldritch power levels for amplified damage. When opting for this strategy, the warlock engineer will usually first shoot with the pistol, then engage in melee combat with the warp blade. This attack option is best used when an enemy is lower on health or when the ratfolk and its allies greatly outnumber their opponents.

**Warpmuskets.** If equipped with a musket, the engineer maintains a greater distance from enemies while firing at surrounded foes to use its Overwhelming Mass feature.

\columnbreak

##### Forbidden Devices

When deciding whether to use Forbidden Devices, the engineer considers the available eldritch power levels and the number of potential targets. A handy trick when trying to decide if the engineer will use a device on any given turn is to consider each power level it has and the number of targets it could hit as individual incentives. At the start of its turn, if there are 4 or more "incentives," it will likely use the device.



The engineer does not hesitate to sacrifice its own minions when using its devices unless the minions hold significant value. Lesser ratfolk soldiers are generally considered disposable.



##### Retreat 
Warlocks retreat from combat when they're outnumbered two to one in melee, their health drops below one-third, or they run out of Forbidden Devices or minions. During a retreat, they can still reload their weapon, enabling the engineer with a musket to keep its distance from melee opponents while taking pot shots at their pursuers.
