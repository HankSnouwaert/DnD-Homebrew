## The Wolf Rat Pits <br> (Player Level: 8-10)
In this encounter, the players enter the holding chamber of a ratfolk laboratory where vicious packs of wolf rats are being contained. As soon as the players arrive, the packmasters spring open the cell grates and unleash the verminous hounds.

### Encounter Context
The players will have likely arrived here to put a stop to the ratfolk before they can unleash their monsters upon the world. Upon the players' arrival, the ratfolk will rush to release the wolf rats from their cells. The players should quickly be made aware of the overwhelming number of wolf rats in these cells.

### Lead Up
Once the ratfolk are aware of the players' presence, each packmaster will attempt to reach the closest grate and use an object interaction to spring it open and release the wolf rats within. 


### The Caged Wolf Rats
There are two cell pits, each with an entrance covered by a grate and containing a different type of wolf rat.

**Opening and Closing the Grates.** The grate over the entrance to the underground cell is springloaded and can be opened with an object interaction. Closing it takes an action from a creature with a free hand. A creature can make a DC 20 Strength check to force the pen open if it's closed.

**When The Wolf Rats Appear.** On initiative count 1 of each round (losing ties), a wolf rat comes out of each open pen and immediately takes its turn. There are 20 wolf rats in each pen.

**Targeting the Pit With Effects.** If the players launch any kind of area of effect damage or crowd control spell down into a cell, you can make a saving throw against it using a wolf rat's modifier. On a failed save, don't have any wolf rat appear from that cell on the next round, as the effect successfully slows their advance.



### Ratfolk Packmasters Tactics
&emsp;**Positioning.** Packmasters are frontline commanders who maintain close proximity to the wolf rats to activate their Pack Leader trait. They use the wolf rats to form a barrier between themselves and the players, ensuring they can command from a position of relative safety.

**Combat Style.** Packmasters employ reach weapons to keep enemies at a distance, making use of their Pack Tactics to gain advantages on attacks and ensuring they can strike effectively while minimizing personal risk.

**Things Catcher.** This weapon allows packmasters to disrupt enemy formations by pulling foes away from their allies, and then directing their minions to surround and isolate the target, effectively cutting them off from support.

* <font color="Purple">**Purple Areas:** Clutter creating difficult terrain for Medium or larger creatures (ratfolk and wolf rats are uneffected thanks to their Crevice Crawler trait) </font>
* <font color="Blue">**Blue Outlines & Areas:** Cages or Gates which can't be passed through, but can be seen through and provide half cover against attacks through them </font>

**Whip.** The whip is primarily a tool for controlling the wolf rats, and packmasters can use it to direct and organize these creatures during combat. However, the wolf rats themselves are typically relied upon for dealing damage.

#### Packlord Tactics
Packlords mostly use the same tactics as packmasters, with the primary difference being their mutagens.

**Mutagen Use.** Packlords enhance their battlefield capabilities by using Mutagens on themselves and their minions. They typically prioritize their most powerful minion for mutagen injections to maximize combat effectiveness, resorting to self-injection only when extremely vulnerable or cornered due to the risk of adverse effects.

#### Gnawfang Tactics
&emsp;**Minion Creation.** Gnawfang can generate rat swarm minions, which can be useful when he's in danger.

**Combat Objectives.** Gnawfang aims to dominate the battlefield by focusing attacks on less agile enemies. He uses his Command bonus action and Maneuver legendary action to coordinate uses of his Overwhelming Strikes legendary actions.


### Aftermath
If the players flee, the ratfolk will wait to pursue them until they have a sufficiently large pack of wolf rats at their disposal. The ratfolk are unlikely to flee so long as they still have open pens with wolf rats streaming out. The wolf rats will fight so long as they have a numbers advantage over the players.

### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what can be harvested from the remains of the iron dogs. As the purpose of the encounter is to collect the sacred wood planks, this could serve as an additional form of treasure.

### XP Award: 8,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players slay all the ratfolk, along with any wolf rats that escape, without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players slay all the ratfolk, along with any wolf rats that escape, but lose significant resources and/or multiple ratfolk escape to potentially alert reinforcements. 
* **50% XP:** The players eliminate at least half the ratfolk but flee before defeating the remainder.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating even half the ratfolk.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-7).** Remove the packlord and the Acidic Saliva and Rabid mutations from the wolf rats. Change the XP award to 5,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 11-13).** Replace the packmasters with packlords, the packlord with Gnawtooth, and the wolf rats with trained wolf rats (with the same mutations). Change the XP award to 14,000 XP per item collected.


### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to make this part of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Renegade Wolf Rats:** After the initial chaos, some of the wolf rats escape into the surrounding area, threatening nearby settlements. The adventurers are hired to track and capture or eliminate these dangerous creatures before they can harm more innocents. |
|  2  | **The Master Mutator:** The mastermind behind the wolf rats—a deranged ratfolk alchemist—is still on the loose. The adventurers must track this individual, who is intent on creating even more dangerous creatures. |
|  3  | **Shut Down the Operation:** Discovering that this lab is just one part of a broader network that breeds and experiments on monstrous creatures, the adventurers embark on a mission to dismantle this network. |
|  4  | **The Alchemist’s Ledger:** Amidst the chaos, the players discover a ledger containing not only the formulae for the mutations but also a list of clients and scheduled deliveries of these beasts.

### Ratfolk Packmasters Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. 

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. In the case of a ninja sorcerer, you may use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check instead. 


#### Ratfolk Packmasters Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.

### Wolf Rat Loot
The valuable items looted from wolf rats will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Wolf Rats Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.
