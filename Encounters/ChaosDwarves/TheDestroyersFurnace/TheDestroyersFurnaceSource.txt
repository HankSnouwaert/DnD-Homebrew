## The Destroyer's Furnace <br> (Player Level: 16-18)
In this encounter, the players battle chaos dwarves within a giant furnace chamber with engineers working the room’s giant bellows to launch blasts of flame at the intruders. Not long into the fight, they manage to lower a dormant infernal destroyer into the chamber, which awakens and joins the battle. 

### Encounter Context
The encounter fits well within a larger dungeon-crawl-style adventure through a chaos dwarf hold or manufacturing facility. The titanic nature of the infernal destroyer means it could even serve as the adventure’s final battle. 

### Lead Up
The players can arrive through any of the room’s four entrances. It’s possible they could burst through the door and catch the furnace’s occupants by surprise. The feasibility of this will depend on the larger context of the adventure and whether the chaos dwarves know they’re coming.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The furnace’s fires light the whole room in bright light.
* **Furnaces.** There are eight furnaces throughout the room, each one with a bellows next to it that can be operated as an action to unleash a 30-foot long, 15-foot wide line of fire. Each creature caught in the fire must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 22(5d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. Each bellows can only be used once per round.
* **Walls.** The furnace’s walls are 30 feet high.


### Running the Encounter
Once the fight starts, the infernal ironsworn will engage the players, and the engineers will start working the room’s bellows to blast the players with fire.

#### The Infernal Destroyer
After two rounds of combat, on initiative count 20, the ceiling will open and lower a dormant infernal destroyer from an alcove above into the center of the room. The destroyer is incapacitated with a speed of 0. On the next round of combat, roll initiative for the destroyer and have it awaken at the start of its turn. The destroyer should have one enhancement of your choice from the list of enhancements found later in this document.

#### Dwarven Reinforcements
On the round the destroyer awakens, and every two rounds afterward, until the destroyer is destroyed, another chaos dwarf engineer will appear at one of the room’s entrances at random.

#### Chaos Dwarf Tactics
The infernal ironsworn will do their best to control the player’s ability to move and set them up for getting blasted by the furnace fires the engineers are unleashing. Because the infernal ironsworn are immune to fire, they can stand wherever they need to hamper the movement of the players.

Once the infernal destroyer arrives, it will work in tandem with the dwarves to dominate the map’s space and make sure it gets caught in the flames to it can use them to heal itself using its Fire Absorption trait.

Beyond this, the dwarves and destroyer will use the general tactics described at the end of the document. Note that some of the destroyer's tactics will depend on the enhancement you chose for it.

### Aftermath
If the players defeat the destroyer, no more dwarves will join the fight, and any remaining dwarves will attempt to retreat. 

If the players retreat, the destroyer and the dwarves give chase if they feel they can press their advantage. Otherwise, fleeing players will most likely be tracked down and cornered by a coordinated force of chaos dwarves.

Assuming the players defeat the destroyer and there are no more remaining dwarves in the chamber, the players should have at least enough time to loot the area before having to deal with other threats.

#### Loot
Guidelines for looting an infernal destroyer and chaos dwarf soldiers can be found at the end of the document. If this is the final encounter in a dungeon adventure, it would be a good time to award one or two treasure hoards worth of treasure from the Treasue Hord: Challenge 17+ table in the DMG. If this is something akin to a “mini-boss” battle partway into a dungeon, award about half as much. 

This treasure can be found in a nearby workshop or storage area and take the form of rare materials and magic items being used to create the constructs and war machines of the chaos dwarves. 

#### XP Award: 25,000xp
The degree of success the players have in overcoming the chaos dwarves and their infernal destroyer can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the dwarves and the infernal destroyer using excellent tactics and without any players being dropped to 0 HP.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the infernal destroyer, but one or more players drop to 0 HP through the fight, or they are pressured into fleeing from any remaining dwarves.
* **50% XP:** The players reduce the infernal destroyer to less than half its HP but then retreat. 
* **10% XP:** The players retreat without reducing the infernal destroyer to less than half its HP.

### Adjusting the Difficulty 
**Easier Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace the infernal ironsworn with infernal guards and remove the enhancement from the infernal destroyer. Change the XP award to 18,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 19-20).** Replace the infernal ironsworn with immortals and add a second enhancement of your choice to the infernal destroyer. After the destroyer awakens, have a new chaos dwarf engineer appear every round instead of every other round. Change the XP award to 41,000 XP.

### Adventure Context
This encounter is likely part of a larger adventure in which the players are adventuring through a chaos dwarf manufacturing facility. The following adventure hooks can provide inspiration as to why the players are there. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Iron Citadel:** The party is tasked with infiltrating a chaos dwarf hold known as the Iron Citadel, which is rumored to be manufacturing a new breed of infernal destroyers. They must find a way to sneak into the fortified stronghold, locate the production facilities, and put an end to the construction of these terrifying machines of war. Along the way, they may uncover the intricate workings of the chaos dwarf society and potentially encounter other dangerous constructs and weapons in development.|
|  2  | **The Laborers' Plea:** A group of slaves have managed to send out a desperate message from within a chaos dwarf manufacturing facility. They speak of being forced to work on creating infernal destroyers and other lethal weapons. The party's mission is to infiltrate the facility, free the slaves, and halt the production of these deadly devices. However, the facility is heavily guarded and the slaves are held under harsh conditions, making this rescue mission a challenging endeavor. |
|  3  | **Infernal Genesis:** A wealthy benefactor tasks the adventurers with stealing the design schematics of the infernal destroyers from a chaos dwarf hold. The party must delve into the heart of the fortress, navigating its labyrinthine tunnels filled with traps, guards, and potentially active infernal destroyers. The adventure could become more complex if the party discovers the moral implications of their benefactor's desire to build their own infernal destroyer. |
|  4  | **The Demon's Heart:** A chaos dwarf facility is rumored to hold a powerful demonic entity that the dwarves intend to bind into the most powerful infernal destroyer ever built. The party's objective is to destroy the Demon's Heart, an artifact used in the binding process, before this unstoppable engine of destruction comes to life. |

\pagebreakNum

### Destroyer Enhancements
If you wish to create a more powerful version of the infernal destroyer, you can give it one of the following enhancements. Doing so increases its CR to 18.

#### Bovine Horns

*This destroyer has been forged in the likeness of a great bull, and if it picks up enough momentum, its horns can shatter mountains.*

When the destroyer makes a Slam attack, it deals extra 13 (2d12) piercing damage on hit for every 20 feet it moved straight toward the target before it hit. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 16), it can't stand up until the start of the destroyer's next turn.

#### Blazing Wings

*The destroyer has been equipped with flaming wings capable of unleashing waves of fire when it lands on the ground.*

The destroyer has a fly speed of 60.

Additionally, if the destroyer is flying and dives at least 20 feet in a straight line before landing on the ground, each other creature standing on the ground within 10 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. 

For each additional 20 feet the destroyer dove before landing, the area of the effect increases by 10 feet, and the damage increases by 9 (2d8).

#### Colossal Plating

*The destroyer has been fitted with large black iron plates welded on either side of its body and etched with unholy runes, which render it nearly indestructible unless they can be removed.*

The destroyer starts with two iron plates attached to it. For each plate attached, it gets +3 to all saving throws and its AC (+6 while both are attached). A creature within 5 feet of the destroyer can use its action to make a DC 21 Strength check to detach one of the plates. It may add its proficiency bonus if it is proficient with Smith's Tools. The creature takes 10(3d6) fire damage when it makes the check if the destroyer's Blazing Body trait is active.

#### Gore Blades

*The destroyer’s body has been covered in razor-sharp blades capable of slicing apart any who draw near.*.

The destroyer's Slam now deals 29 (6d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6) fire damage on hit.

When a creature misses with a melee attack against the destroyer while within 5 feet of it, attempts to grapple it, or starts its turn grappling it, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage. 

Additionally, when a creature moves into or within the area the destroyer is occupying, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

## Chaos Dwarf Tactics

### Chaos Dwarf Solider Tactics
Chaos dwarfs are twisted versions of regular dwarves who possess perverted versions of traditional dwarven traits. Dwarven stubbornness has turned to unrelenting hatred, their love of crafting has been channeled into the creation of weapons of destruction, and their pride now causes them to see all others as beneath them. 

Despite these grotesque changes in attitude, the combat tactics of chaos dwarfs differ little from those of their standard kin. They are most effective when occupying a fortified position and using ranged weaponry to batter their enemies from afar while their unyielding melee forces hold the line.

One significant difference in combat strategy stems from their reliance on acquiring forced labor, as chaos dwarf society runs on the backs of captured prisoners who are relentlessly worked to death. This means chaos dwarves will not be content to drive an enemy off. If an enemy force flees, and the chaos dwarves believe they have an overwhelming combat advantage, they will chase down their foes to capture them. 

There are two abilities common to all chaos dwarves:

#### Resolute Stance

Dwarves can best use this ability when fighting in confined spaces that don’t require much movement. The optimal scenario involves a mix of ranged and melee dwarf combatants. The ranged dwarves will hunker down behind cover with this ability, making it very difficult to counter them with ranged attacks. They will then have melee dwarfs stand about 5 or 10 feet in front of them to stop anyone who approaches with readied attacks. Dwarves are patient and resilient, so they will tolerate taking fire from enemies this way if it seems like their own ranged attacks are outpacing their enemies’.

If the players bombard chaos dwarves with area-of-effect attacks or effects that force saving throws, this may force dwarves out of their defensive position and cause them to charge the players or even flee if they’ve taken heavy damage. Though, many chaos dwarves can resist common damage types such as poison and fire, which may allow them to better endure such abilities.

When dwarves use this ability, be sure to communicate it to the players. You can say something to the effect of “the dwarf plants his feet firmly and stares you down, ready for anything that comes at him.”

#### Debilitating Strike

The primary purpose of this ability is to allow chaos dwarves to take prisoners of war to serve as forced labor. They will do non-lethal damage when bringing creatures down to 0 hit points, even if they’re fighting a group with a healer. 

\pagebreakNum

#### Infernal Guards
These are elite dwarven soldiers that fight with unflinching resolve. Their tactics will depend on what they’re armed with.

##### Axemen
These infernal guards are just a stronger version of chaos dwarf warriors, with the only mechanical difference being that their attacks made with advantage hit even harder. Their tactics are essentially the same as normal chaos dwarf warriors. 

#### Infernal Ironsworn
The main difference between infernal ironsworn and other chaos dwarf infantry is their blasting charges. They will usually use their blasting charges when they are being charged, when charging toward an enemy, or if they can hit three or more targets. However, there are two things they must watch out for:

* Enemies within their reach can interrupt the grenade and cause it to detonate on top of the dwarf.
* When throwing the grenade, the dwarf must consider that other dwarves may be hit by the blast. Some dwarves are resistant to fire or outright immune in the case of the infernal ironguard. However, if dwarves caught in the blast are in a resolute stance, they will have disadvantage on the saving throw and likely take the full piercing damage from the blast. Depending on the circumstances, the infernal ironsworn may still opt to use the bombs even if they hit allies.

##### The Immortals
The signature ability of The Immortals is their Undying Will. It's important to note that they start the fight with extra temporary hit points granted by this ability. The Immortals typically begin the fight clustered together and try to bait out area-of-effect spells from the enemy, hoping that it won't deal enough damage to break their Undying Will, and they'll simply regain their lost temporary hit points. They may avoid this tactic if they know the enemy has area-of-effect spells that deal damage other than fire. Once The Immortals have spread out, they use their Undying Will to keep themselves safe while moving into prime positions. They prefer to fight one-on-one, as facing multiple enemies poses a greater risk of damage overcoming their Undying Will.

#### Dwarves With Polearms
The variant rule that allows dwarves to use halberds does not change their tactics but improves the already listed tactics, as having reach enables them to use their Resolute Stance more frequently. If you’re using this rule, keep in mind that it does remove the dwarves’ weakness to reach weapons. This is a more realistic tactical choice on their part, but it also gives players few options to counter them.

\columnbreak

### Infernal Destroyer Tactics

Infernal destroyers are mindless monsters, driven solely by their destructive instincts, with little regard for their own survival. They never flee from a fight and will fight to the death. However, their creators can guide their actions and may direct them to execute more complex tactics. If these creators are killed or incapacitated, the destroyer will revert back to its base instincts.

Infernal destroyers serve as hard-hitting shock troopers. Because their Burning Bright feature causes them to become unstable over time and lose attacks as they take damage, their best defense is their offense, hitting with such force that opponents struggle to properly retaliate from the brutal attacks. 

When guided by a more intelligent mind, they may attempt to engage the largest group of enemies to set them ablaze with their Blazing Body feature, focusing all attacks on any targets they believe will resist being burned away by their aura. They may unleash a 'Burning Barrage' to target backline foes, especially those casting dangerous spells. 

Armies with one or more infernal destroyers will follow similar tactics, aiming to hit hard at the beginning of the fight to break their enemies, utilizing all available resources and their strongest spells early in combat before their destroyers run the risk of destabilizing.

Infernal destroyers can be equipped with one of four upgrades that slightly alter their tactics:
* **Brazen Wings:** Allows them to disrupt backline foes by flying past sturdy front liners and slamming into groups of ranged combatants and spellcasters.

* **Colossal Plating:** Turns them into juggernauts, helping them stay alive. Their dwarven allies will focus on impeding whoever is most likely to remove the plating.

* **Gore Blades:** Enables them to shred through swarms of melee enemies, staying in the front line and serving as a blockade to protect more vulnerable creatures fighting alongside the destroyer.

* **Razer Horns:** Enhances their ability to destroy single targets. Fragile damage dealers, such as lightly armored wizards, will be decimated if the destroyer reaches them, and the destroyer is not afraid to take opportunity attacks if it means getting a charge against its intended target.

## Chaos Dwarf Loot
### Chaos Dwarf Soldier Loot
Because chaos dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Chaos Dwarf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Infernal Destroyer Loot
Because infernal destroyers are constructs, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
