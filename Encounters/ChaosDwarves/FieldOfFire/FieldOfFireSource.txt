## Field of Fire <br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this encounter, the party must cross a lava field that heats up at random intervals while a squad of chaos dwarf riflemen on the other side try to gun them down.

### Encounter Context
The players’ goal is to cross the field in one piece. They will most likely need to defeat the chaos dwarves to do so.

Their reasons for being here don’t matter much to the encounter, and it can be used in a variety of contexts. This could be the players’ first encounter with chaos dwarves, or they could be trying to flee chaos dwarf territory across the lava fields when they encounter a patrol. The player should have some understanding of the lava field’s hazards by the time this encounter begins.



### Lead Up
The players arrive from the bottom of the map. Because there isn’t much to provide cover in the lava fields, it is unlikely they will be arriving stealthily. Once the players come up over the lower slope and appear on the map, they will spot the dwarves, who will also see them and begin the encounter.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** If it is nighttime, all of the lighting will be provided by the glowing heat of the volcanic earth, which provides dim light to the whole map.
* **Super-Heated Surface.** The lowest surface of the map burns with magmatic heat that shines through the cracks in its surface. Each time a creature enters a 5-foot square on this surface or starts its turn there, it takes 17 (5d6) fire damage. 
* **Elevated Surfaces.** These are not scalding hot and can be walked across without taking damage. 
* **Rock Formations.** These areas have varying heights and can be climbed at half-speed.


### Running the Encounter
Once the fight starts, it will be a race for the player to move across their hazardous environment and neutralize the dwarfs while trying to survive the environment’s head and the ranged attacks of the chaos dwarves.
#### Erupting Flames
The flames just beneath the ground’s surface will erupt at random, momentarily bathing the lower levels of the map in fire. On initiative count 20 each turn roll a d4. On a 1 or 2, the fire erupts. Each creature on the super-heated surface or the areas 10 feet above it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 15d6 fire damage if it’s on the super-heated surface or 10d6 fire damage if it's on a surface 10 feet above. A creature takes half as much damage on a successful save. Creatures higher than 10 feet above the super-heated surfaces are unaffected.

<br>



#### The Chaos Dwarves
The chaos dwarves will move to positions where they can avoid the erupting flames and get a clear shot at the players. Beyond these priorities, they will avoid moving whenever they can help it and use their Resolute Stance ability to hunker down and fire upon the players. When running the chaos dwarves, you may need to balance the tactical decisions of moving to get a shot at a more important target or just shooting at the best targets currently available without moving so you can use Resolute Stance. 

Unless reinforcements are nearby, the chaos dwarves are unlikely to flee, even if they’re losing. With their low speed, they would be unlikely to escape, and so they will likely fight to the death.

### Aftermath
If the players defeat the chaos dwarves, they will be able to continue their journey across the lava fields. If they flee the dwarves, the dwarves may pursue them or call in reinforcements if they are ill-equipped to do so. 

If there are other chaos dwarves nearby, one or more of the dwarves from this encounter may have fled from a losing battle to alert their allies. In this case, the players may need to chase down and stop the dwarf before he gets backup.


#### Loot
The players can loot the individual chaos dwarves they’ve slain for any valuables they’re carrying. You can use the loot tables described later in this document as a guide for what they might find.

If you wish to provide the players with additional treasure, the castellan could be carrying an uncommon magic item or 2d4 100gp gems socketed into his armaments. 


#### XP Award: 10,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in overcoming the chaos dwarves can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the dwarves and cross the field of fire without party members dropping to 0 hit points.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the dwarves and cross the field of fire, but one or more party members dropped to 0 hit points, or one or more of the dwarves escaped. 
* **50% XP:** The players escape across the lava without defeating the dwarves and are now being pursued.
* **10% XP:** The players retreat back the way they came without defeating the dwarves.



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 8-10).** Replace the fireglaivadiers with bluderbussiers. Change the damage dealt by walking on the super-heated surface to 4d6 fire damage. Change the damage dealt by the erupting flames to 8d6 fire damage for creatures on the 10-foot high surfaces and 12d6 fire damage for creatures on the super-heated surface. Change the XP award to 8,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace the fireglaivadiers with Granite Gaurd. Change the damage dealt by walking on the super-heated surface to 6d6 fire damage. Change the damage dealt by the erupting flames to 12d6 fire damage for creatures on the 10-foot high surfaces and 18d6 fire damage for creatures on the super-heated surface. Change the XP award to 17,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Unstable Core:** The party discovers that the area’s volcanic activity is not natural. The chaos dwarves have been drilling into the planet's core, threatening to cause a cataclysmic eruption that could decimate the entire continent. The party must infiltrate the chaos dwarf stronghold and halt their operations before it's too late.|
|  2  | **The Emberforged Weapon:** The chaos dwarves are utilizing the volcanic environment to forge a weapon of immense destructive power, capable of incinerating towns and armies in an instant. The party must track down the weapon's location and neutralize it before it can be used. |
|  3  | **The Molten Legion:** The volcanic environment is merely a defensive perimeter for a large chaos dwarf fortress. From there, an army of chaos dwarves, known as the Molten Legion, prepares to march against the free realms. The party must infiltrate the fortress, disrupt the army's organization, and slow its inevitable advance.  |
|  4  | **The Shattered Chains:** The volcanic field is actually a horrific penal colony where the chaos dwarves send their slaves to harvest rare minerals. The conditions are unbearable, and many perish from the heat and toxic fumes. Upon learning this, the party might commit to dismantling this inhumane operation and liberating the countless souls chained within it. |

## Chaos Dwarf Soldier Loot
Because chaos dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### Chaos Dwarf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Chaos Dwarf Solider Tactics
Chaos dwarfs are twisted versions of regular dwarves who possess perverted versions of traditional dwarven traits. Dwarven stubbornness has turned to unrelenting hatred, their love of crafting has been channeled into the creation of weapons of destruction, and their pride now causes them to see all others as beneath them. 

Despite these grotesque changes in attitude, the combat tactics of chaos dwarfs differ little from those of their standard kin. They are most effective when occupying a fortified position and using ranged weaponry to batter their enemies from afar while their unyielding melee forces hold the line.

One significant difference in combat strategy stems from their reliance on acquiring forced labor, as chaos dwarf society runs on the backs of captured prisoners who are relentlessly worked to death. This means chaos dwarves will not be content to drive an enemy off. If an enemy force flees, and the chaos dwarves believe they have an overwhelming combat advantage, they will chase down their foes to capture them. 

There are two abilities common to all chaos dwarves:

### Resolute Stance

Dwarves can best use this ability when fighting in confined spaces that don’t require much movement. The optimal scenario involves a mix of ranged and melee dwarf combatants. The ranged dwarves will hunker down behind cover with this ability, making it very difficult to counter them with ranged attacks. They will then have melee dwarfs stand about 5 or 10 feet in front of them to stop anyone who approaches with readied attacks. Dwarves are patient and resilient, so they will tolerate taking fire from enemies this way if it seems like their own ranged attacks are outpacing their enemies’.

If the players bombard chaos dwarves with area-of-effect attacks or effects that force saving throws, this may force dwarves out of their defensive position and cause them to charge the players or even flee if they’ve taken heavy damage. Though, many chaos dwarves can resist common damage types such as poison and fire, which may allow them to better endure such abilities.

When dwarves use this ability, be sure to communicate it to the players. You can say something to the effect of “the dwarf plants his feet firmly and stares you down, ready for anything that comes at him.”

### Debilitating Strike

The primary purpose of this ability is to allow chaos dwarves to take prisoners of war to serve as forced labor. They will do non-lethal damage when bringing creatures down to 0 hit points, even if they’re fighting a group with a healer. 

\pagebreakNum



###  Blunderbussiers
Blunderbussier tactics are simpler than those of melee chaos dwarf infantry, as they only need to find a good vantage point from which to enter a Resolute Srance and start blasting their foes. There are a few factors to keep in mind:
* The blunderbuss is a two-handed weapon, so the dwarf cannot hold a shield while using it.
* The Piercing Rounds ability means that the dwarf will prioritize targets with high AC but low health.
* After each attack with a blunderbuss, the dwarf must either use up its next action to reload it or enter a Resolute Stance at the start of its next turn, which will prevent it from moving. 
* If the dwarf cannot reload its blunderbuss effectively and is caught in melee combat, it will not hesitate to switch to a shield and axe to fight.

#### The Granite Guard
These soldiers are even more effective snipers than normal blunderbussiers, though they have no qualms about engaging isolated creatures in melee combat if need be.

### Infernal Guards
These are elite dwarven soldiers that fight with unflinching resolve. Their tactics will depend on what they’re armed with.

#### Fireglaivadiers
Fireglaivadiers are unique in that they have a ranged attack but are more effective in melee combat. There are several attack sequences they can use:

When in a Resolute Stance with an enemy in melee range, they can make both a ranged attack and a melee attack. Since they don't suffer disadvantage from using ranged attacks in melee combat, this is the most effective attack pattern.

When in a Resolute Stance with no enemies nearby, they can only make a single ranged attack. This is useful when defending a position and waiting for enemies to come to them.

If the dwarf is close to a pursuing enemy or slowly retreating, they can make two melee attacks.

When trying to finish off fleeing targets, they can fire their weapon and use their other attack to reload. This is not an optimal attack pattern and should be avoided as possible.

### Chaos Dwarf Castellans
Chaos dwarf castellans share most of the techniques used by fireglaivadiers, with a couple of new abilities added to their arsenal:

#### Infusion of Hatred
This enhancement is placed on the most deadly dwarf under the castellan’s command who is not already benefiting from it, and it will use this bonus action every turn during combat. 

#### Specialized Ammunition
The castellan has two specialized bullets that it can fire from its fire glaive and will use them in different ways depending on the spacing of its opponents.

If its enemies are grouped up, it will use Infernal Slugs if it can affect three or more targets with the slug’s blast. Otherwise, it will use Molten Bullets on creatures that are either the most isolated from their allies or concentrating on spells. This can set up a deadly combo as party members attempt to assist each other with pulling out the Molten Bullets, while the castellan can take full advantage of them being near each other to pelt them with Infernal Slugs.
