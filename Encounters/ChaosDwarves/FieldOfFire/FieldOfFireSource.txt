## Field of Fire <br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this encounter, the party must cross a lava field that heats up at random intervals while a squad of chaos dwarf riflemen on the other side try to gun them down.

### Encounter Context
The players’ goal is to cross the field in one piece. They will most likely need to defeat the chaos dwarves to do so.

Their reasons for being here don’t matter much to the encounter, and it can be used in a variety of contexts. This could be the players’ first encounter with chaos dwarves, or they could be trying to flee chaos dwarf territory across the lava fields when they encounter a patrol. The player should have some understanding of the lava field’s hazards by the time this encounter begins.



### Lead Up
The players arrive from the bottom of the map. Because there isn’t much to provide cover in the lava fields, it is unlikely they will be arriving stealthily. Once the players come up over the lower slope and appear on the map, they will spot the dwarves, who will also see them and begin the encounter.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** If it is nighttime, all of the lighting will be provided by the glowing heat of the volcanic earth, which provides dim light to the whole map.
* **Super-Heated Surface.** The lowest surface of the map burns with magmatic heat that shines through the cracks in its surface. Each time a creature enters a 5-foot square on this surface or starts its turn there, it takes 17 (5d6) fire damage. 
* **Elevated Surfaces.** These are not scalding hot and can be walked across without taking damage. 
* **Rock Formations.** These areas have varying heights and can be climbed at half-speed.


### Running the Encounter
Once the fight starts, it will be a race for the player to move across their hazardous environment and neutralize the dwarfs while trying to survive the environment’s head and the ranged attacks of the chaos dwarves.
#### Erupting Flames
The flames just beneath the ground’s surface will erupt at random, momentarily bathing the lower levels of the map in fire. On initiative count 20 each turn roll a d4. On a 1 or 2, the fire erupts. Each creature on the super-heated surface or the areas 10 feet above it must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 15d6 fire damage if it’s on the super-heated surface or 10d6 fire damage if it's on a surface 10 feet above. A creature takes half as much damage on a successful save. Creatures higher than 10 feet above the super-heated surfaces are unaffected.

#### The Chaos Dwarves
The chaos dwarves will move to positions where they can avoid the erupting flames and get a clear shot at the players. Beyond these priorities, they will avoid moving whenever they can help it and use their Resolute Stance ability to hunker down and fire upon the players. When running the chaos dwarves, you may need to balance the tactical decisions of moving to get a shot at a more important target or just shooting at the best targets currently available without moving so you can use Resolute Stance. 

Unless reinforcements are nearby, the chaos dwarves are unlikely to flee, even if they’re losing. With their low speed, they would be unlikely to escape, and so they will likely fight to the death.

### Aftermath
If the players defeat the chaos dwarves, they will be able to continue their journey across the lava fields. If they flee the dwarves, the dwarves may pursue them or call in reinforcements if they are ill-equipped to do so. 

If there are other chaos dwarves nearby, one or more of the dwarves from this encounter may have fled from a losing battle to alert their allies. In this case, the players may need to chase down and stop the dwarf before he gets backup.


#### Loot
The players can loot the individual chaos dwarves they’ve slain for any valuables they’re carrying. You can use the loot tables described later in this document as a guide for what they might find.

If you wish to provide the players with additional treasure, the castellan could be carrying an uncommon magic item or 2d4 100gp gems socketed into his armaments. 


#### XP Award: 10,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in overcoming the chaos dwarves can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the dwarves and cross the field of fire without party members dropping to 0 hit points.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the dwarves and cross the field of fire, but one or more party members dropped to 0 hit points, or one or more of the dwarves escaped. 
* **50% XP:** The players escape across the lava without defeating the dwarves and are now being pursued.
* **10% XP:** The players retreat back the way they came without defeating the dwarves.



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 8-10).** Replace the fireglaivadiers with bluderbussiers. Change the damage dealt by walking on the super-heated surface to 4d6 fire damage. Change the damage dealt by the erupting flames to 8d6 fire damage for creatures on the 10-foot high surfaces and 12d6 fire damage for creatures on the super-heated surface. Change the XP award to 8,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace the fireglaivadiers with Granite Gaurd. Change the damage dealt by walking on the super-heated surface to 6d6 fire damage. Change the damage dealt by the erupting flames to 12d6 fire damage for creatures on the 10-foot high surfaces and 18d6 fire damage for creatures on the super-heated surface. Change the XP award to 17,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Unstable Core:** The party discovers that the area’s volcanic activity is not natural. The chaos dwarves have been drilling into the planet's core, threatening to cause a cataclysmic eruption that could decimate the entire continent. The party must infiltrate the chaos dwarf stronghold and halt their operations before it's too late.|
|  2  | **The Emberforged Weapon:** The chaos dwarves are utilizing the volcanic environment to forge a weapon of immense destructive power, capable of incinerating towns and armies in an instant. The party must track down the weapon's location and neutralize it before it can be used. |
|  3  | **The Molten Legion:** The volcanic environment is merely a defensive perimeter for a large chaos dwarf fortress. From there, an army of chaos dwarves, known as the Molten Legion, prepares to march against the free realms. The party must infiltrate the fortress, disrupt the army's organization, and slow its inevitable advance.  |
|  4  | **The Shattered Chains:** The volcanic field is actually a horrific penal colony where the chaos dwarves send their slaves to harvest rare minerals. The conditions are unbearable, and many perish from the heat and toxic fumes. Upon learning this, the party might commit to dismantling this inhumane operation and liberating the countless souls chained within it. |
