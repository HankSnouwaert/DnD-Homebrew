## The Dwarven Taskmasters <br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this encounter, the players are attempting to free workers being held prisoners by chaos dwarf taskmasters within a mine. 

### Encounter Context
The players' goal is to free as many workers as possible. They may have been sent on a mission to do this, or they may be doing it of their own volition because it’s the right thing to do. In any case, the success of the encounter is measured by how many workers are freed. 

It should also be assumed that there is somewhere that at least provides temporary safety to fleeing workers not far from the map’s exit in the top right corner, where they can hide until the encounter is over.


### Lead Up
The map’s top right exit leads to the surface, while the top exit leads deeper into the mines. The players could be approaching from either passage, depending on whether they're just entering the mines or are on their way out. This may be the first room of the mine where they are freeing prisoners before continuing onwards, or this may be one of the final encounters of their journey as they flee and attempt to bring some workers with them. These circumstances will also determine whether the players have the opportunity to sneak in and attempt a surprise attack on the chaos dwarf overseers in the room.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** All of the lighting is provided by the torches shown on the map and will vary between dim and bright light depending on how close to a torch someone is.
* **The Mine.** 
* **Stone Debris.** The mines are littered with rocks that are rough terrain and can provide half-cover against ranged attacks.




### Running the Encounter

Once the fight starts, it will become a struggle for the players to free as many workers as possible while the chaos dwarves attempt to cow the workers into submission and kill any attempting to escape. 

#### The Dwarf Taskmasters

The dwarves fight using most of the general tactics described later in this document. The main difference with this encounter is the presence of the laborers attempting to escape. The dwarves will prioritize preventing a laborer's escape, as one escaping could inspire others to do the same. The overseer will use his brutal motivation against any worker in danger of escaping whenever possible.

<br>

If combat lasts for more than six rounds, another infernal guard and chaos dwarf with a blunderbuss should appear at the top of the map to serve as reinforcements.

#### The Laborers

Use the commoner stat block from the Monster Manual for the laborers. 

At the end of a player's turn, they can attempt to convince any workers within 30 feet to attempt to escape by making a DC 13 Persuasion (Charisma) check. This check does not require an action. The player has advantage on this check if a dwarf has been reduced to zero hit points since the start of that player's last turn. If one of the workers has been reduced to zero hit points since the last turn, the check will have disadvantage. If the check is successful, the workers are persuaded to run and will begin dashing away in an attempt to escape. 

A worker will automatically start making an escape attempt if there are no dwarves within 30 feet of it at the start of its turn.

### Aftermath
Once the players have made their escape, they will most likely be responsible for escorting the freed workers out of chaos dwarf territory and back to safety. There will likely be more chaos dwarves in hot pursuit, which could lead to a small adventure in itself. Alternatively, there may be other friendly NPCs nearby who can pick up the workers and make sure they get to safety. 

#### Loot
The players can loot the individual chaos dwarves they’ve slain for any valuables they’re carrying. You can use the loot tables described later in this document as a guide for what they might find.

If you wish to provide the players with treasure based on how many workers they freed, you can award them 1d4 100gp gems per freed worker. This could be compensation provided by someone who hired them, or it could be gems the workers dug up or stole before being freed that they give the players out of gratitude. 


#### XP Award
For each worker the players successfully free, award them 1,500 XP.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 6-8).** Replace the Dread Shredder with a normal dread saurian. Change the XP award per freed worker to 500 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace the Dread Shredder with a normal dread saurian. Equip it with an artifact and a howdah with two weapons of your choice that’s crewed by 8 skink behemoth keepers. Change the XP award per freed worker to 2,000 XP.

**Hardest Encounter (Level 16-18).** Equip the Dread Shredder with an artifact and a howdah with two weapons of your choice that’s crewed by 8 skink behemoth keepers. Change the XP award per freed worker to 3,500 XP. Increase the value of the gems awarded for freeing workers from 100gp to 1,000gp.
