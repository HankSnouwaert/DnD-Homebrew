## The Dwarven Taskmasters <br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this encounter, the players are attempting to free workers being held prisoners by chaos dwarf taskmasters within a mining quarry. 

### Encounter Context
The players' goal is to free as many workers as possible. They may have been sent on a mission to do this, or they may be doing it of their own volition because it’s the right thing to do. In any case, the success of the encounter is measured by how many workers are freed. 

It should also be assumed that there is somewhere that at least provides temporary safety to fleeing workers not far from the map’s exit in the top right corner, where they can hide until the encounter is over.


### Lead Up
The map’s top right exit leads to freedom, while the top exit leads further into the quarry. The players could be approaching from either passage, depending on whether they're just entering the quarries or are on their way out. This may be the first area of the quarry where they are freeing prisoners before continuing onwards, or this may be one of the final encounters of their journey as they flee and attempt to bring some workers with them. These circumstances will also determine whether the players have the opportunity to sneak in and attempt a surprise attack on the chaos dwarf overseers in this area.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** If it is nighttime, all of the lighting will be provided by the torches shown on the map and will vary between dim and bright light depending on how close to a torch someone is.
* **Stone Debris.** These rocks are rough terrain and provide half-cover against ranged attacks.




### Running the Encounter

Once the fight starts, it will become a struggle for the players to free as many workers as possible while the chaos dwarves attempt to cow the workers into submission and kill any attempting to escape. 

#### The Dwarf Taskmasters

The dwarves fight using most of the general tactics described later in this document. The main difference with this encounter is the presence of the workers attempting to escape. The dwarves will prioritize preventing a worker's escape, as one escaping could inspire others to do the same. The overseer will use his brutal motivation against any worker in danger of escaping whenever possible. 

If combat lasts for more than six rounds, another infernal guard and chaos dwarf with a blunderbuss should appear at the top of the map to serve as reinforcements.

<br>



#### The Workers

Use the commoner stat block from the Monster Manual for the workers. 

At the end of a player's turn, they can attempt to convince any workers within 30 feet to attempt to escape by making a DC 13 Persuasion (Charisma) check. This check does not require an action. The player has advantage on this check if a dwarf has been reduced to zero hit points since the start of that player's last turn. If one of the workers has been reduced to zero hit points since the last turn, the check will have disadvantage. If the check is successful, the workers are persuaded to run and will begin dashing away in an attempt to escape. 

A worker will automatically start making an escape attempt if there are no dwarves within 30 feet of it at the start of its turn.

### Aftermath
Once the players have made their escape, they will most likely be responsible for escorting the freed workers out of chaos dwarf territory and back to safety. There will likely be more chaos dwarves in hot pursuit, which could lead to a small adventure in itself. Alternatively, there may be other friendly NPCs nearby who can pick up the workers and make sure they get to safety. 

#### Loot
The players can loot the individual chaos dwarves they’ve slain for any valuables they’re carrying. You can use the loot tables described later in this document as a guide for what they might find.

If you wish to provide the players with treasure based on how many workers they freed, you can award them 1d4 100gp gems per freed worker. This could be compensation provided by someone who hired them, or it could be gems the workers dug up or stole before being freed that they give the players out of gratitude. 


#### XP Award
For each worker the players successfully free, award them 1,500 XP.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 6-8).** Replace the blazing beards with normal chaos dwarf warriors and the infernal ironsworn with an infernal guard (axeman). Change the XP award per freed worker to 500 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace the blazing beards with infernal guards (axemen) and the infernal ironsworn with an overseer. Change the XP award per freed worker to 2,000 XP.

**Hardest Encounter (Level 16-18).** Replace the blazing beards with infernal ironsworn, the blunderbussiers with Granite Guard, and the infernal ironsworn with an overseer. Change the XP award per freed worker to 3,500 XP. Increase the value of the gems awarded for freeing workers from 100gp to 1,000gp.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Heart of the Mountain:** The slaves have been forced to work in a mine that reaches deep into the earth. The chaos dwarves are searching for the Heart of the Mountain, a powerful gemstone said to amplify the destructive powers of their sorcery. The party must delve into the mines and secure the Heart before the chaos dwarves can find it.|
|  2  | **The Slave King's Uprising:** One of the slaves the party frees is a charismatic and tactical-minded individual who proposes a rebellion. He convinces the party to aid him in rallying the slaves across multiple chaos dwarf work camps to rise against their oppressors, leading to a larger campaign against the chaos dwarves. |
|  3  | **The Infernal Artifacts:** The slaves have been working on crafting artifacts imbued with the essence of fire, which the chaos dwarves intend to use to awaken a long-dormant volcano, turning the entire region into a molten wasteland. The party must gather these artifacts and find a way to neutralize them before it's too late.  |
|  4  | **The Ironworn's Debt:** During the rescue, the party saves a former Infernal Ironsworn, disgraced and demoted to slave labor. In gratitude, he offers vital information about chaos dwarves, including their weaknesses, and seeks the party's help in his personal quest for vengeance against his former masters. |

## Chaos Dwarf Solider Tactics
Chaos dwarfs are twisted versions of regular dwarves who possess perverted versions of traditional dwarven traits. Dwarven stubbornness has turned to unrelenting hatred, their love of crafting has been channeled into the creation of weapons of destruction, and their pride now causes them to see all others as beneath them. 

Despite these grotesque changes in attitude, the combat tactics of chaos dwarfs differ little from those of their standard kin. They are most effective when occupying a fortified position and using ranged weaponry to batter their enemies from afar while their unyielding melee forces hold the line.

One significant difference in combat strategy stems from their reliance on acquiring forced labor, as chaos dwarf society runs on the backs of captured prisoners who are relentlessly worked to death. This means chaos dwarves will not be content to drive an enemy off. If an enemy force flees, and the chaos dwarves believe they have an overwhelming combat advantage, they will chase down their foes to capture them. 

There are two abilities common to all chaos dwarves:

### Resolute Stance

Dwarves can best use this ability when fighting in confined spaces that don’t require much movement. The optimal scenario involves a mix of ranged and melee dwarf combatants. The ranged dwarves will hunker down behind cover with this ability, making it very difficult to counter them with ranged attacks. They will then have melee dwarfs stand about 5 or 10 feet in front of them to stop anyone who approaches with readied attacks. Dwarves are patient and resilient, so they will tolerate taking fire from enemies this way if it seems like their own ranged attacks are outpacing their enemies’.

If the players bombard chaos dwarves with area-of-effect attacks or effects that force saving throws, this may force dwarves out of their defensive position and cause them to charge the players or even flee if they’ve taken heavy damage. Though, many chaos dwarves can resist common damage types such as poison and fire, which may allow them to better endure such abilities.

When dwarves use this ability, be sure to communicate it to the players. You can say something to the effect of “the dwarf plants his feet firmly and stares you down, ready for anything that comes at him.”

### Debilitating Strike

The primary purpose of this ability is to allow chaos dwarves to take prisoners of war to serve as forced labor. They will do non-lethal damage when bringing creatures down to 0 hit points, even if they’re fighting a group with a healer.

### Chaos Dwarf Warriors

Chaos Dwarf warriors act as the frontline in battle. When part of a well-balanced army, they generally use the standard chaos dwarf tactics described earlier. However, if they are the only type of soldier on the battlefield, they will take one of two tactics depending on the situation.
* If the enemy can attack from range, the dwarfs charge into melee combat, taking the Dash action if needed to get within range. On their next turn, they will take a Resolute stance and fight, forcing their opponent to either fight them in melee with disadvantage or take an opportunity attack to withdraw.
* If the enemy charges the chaos dwarf warriors, they will merely hold their position with Resolute Stance and ready attacks for when the enemy comes within reach.

Chaos dwarf warriors prioritize attacking targets they can reach while in a Resolute Stance.

#### Blazing Beard Warriors

When blazing beards are on fire, their attacks deal more damage. Moreover, when they attack an enemy that is already on fire, it causes even more damage. Their main priority is to set as many enemies and other blazing beards on fire. There are several ways to achieve this, including:
* If a blazing beard is moving towards an enemy and can't quite reach them, they can throw a naphtha bomb that hits the enemy and themselves on the opposite edge of the blast radius.
* If a blazing beard is in a resolute stance and doesn't want to move, it may use its naphtha bomb as described above.
* Running into a group of creatures using their burning resolve ability is also quite effective.

###  Blunderbussiers
Blunderbussier tactics are simpler than those of melee chaos dwarf infantry, as they only need to find a good vantage point from which to enter a Resolute Srance and start blasting their foes. There are a few factors to keep in mind:
* The blunderbuss is a two-handed weapon, so the dwarf cannot hold a shield while using it.
* The Piercing Rounds ability means that the dwarf will prioritize targets with high AC but low health.
* After each attack with a blunderbuss, the dwarf must either use up its next action to reload it or enter a Resolute Stance at the start of its next turn, which will prevent it from moving. 
* If the dwarf cannot reload its blunderbuss effectively and is caught in melee combat, it will not hesitate to switch to a shield and axe to fight.

#### The Granite Guard
These soldiers are even more effective snipers than normal blunderbussiers, though they have no qualms about engaging isolated creatures in melee combat if need be.

One difference in their tactics stems from their Suppressing Fire ability, which makes them more likely to shoot targets that rely on speed, such as rogues.

### Infernal Guards
These are elite dwarven soldiers that fight with unflinching resolve. Their tactics will depend on what they’re armed with.

#### Axemen
These infernal guards are just a stronger version of chaos dwarf warriors, with the only mechanical difference being that their attacks made with advantage hit even harder. Their tactics are essentially the same as normal chaos dwarf warriors. 




### Infernal Ironsworn
The main difference between infernal ironsworn and other chaos dwarf infantry is their blasting charges. They will usually use their blasting charges when they are being charged, when charging toward an enemy, or if they can hit three or more targets. However, there are two things they must watch out for:

* Enemies within their reach can interrupt the grenade and cause it to detonate on top of the dwarf.
* When throwing the grenade, the dwarf must consider that other dwarves may be hit by the blast. Some dwarves are resistant to fire or outright immune in the case of the infernal ironguard. However, if dwarves caught in the blast are in a resolute stance, they will have disadvantage on the saving throw and likely take the full piercing damage from the blast. Depending on the circumstances, the infernal ironsworn may still opt to use the bombs even if they hit allies.


### Chaos Dwarf Overseers
Chaos dwarf overseers can make their allies more aggressive. They are most effective when the overseer has a mix of cheap expendable units, such as forced workers and more elite dwarves and warriors.

#### Brutal Motivation
The overseer can use one of his attacks to kill one of his workers to activate this ability. As long as at least two of his dwarves benefit from it, he will consider it a worthwhile tradeoff. The overseer can also trigger the ability by reducing an enemy to zero hit points, but this is a risky move and should only be done if he’s sure to bring the enemy down.

#### Harsh Discipline
The overseer sends non-dwarf workers to slow down the enemy before using this ability on his dwarves and any workers within range. This allows the workers to better hold their ground and the dwarves to march forward and fight more effectively.


### Dwarves With Polearms
The variant rule that allows dwarves to use halberds does not change their tactics but improves the already listed tactics, as having reach enables them to use their Resolute Stance more frequently. If you’re using this rule, keep in mind that it does remove the dwarves’ weakness to reach weapons. This is a more realistic tactical choice on their part, but it also gives players few options to counter them.

## Chaos Dwarf Soldier Loot
Because chaos dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### Chaos Dwarf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
