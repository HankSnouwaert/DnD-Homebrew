## The Charred Den  <br> (Player Level: 9-11)
In this encounter, the players find the charred corpse of a frost worm in a frozen tundra and soon find themselves facing the fiery elemental wolverine dwelling within.

### Encounter Context
The players may have been sent to harvest valuable remains from the frost worm, or they may have stumbled upon it while traveling the tundra looking for shelter. In any case, the players should have good reason to claim the remains of the frost worm for themselves.

### Lead Up
The players arrive from the forest entrance on the right side of the map. They can attempt to stealthily approach Grandmother in her hut by using the trees as cover, but she will be on the lookout for them.

### The Frost Worm Corpse
Large or smaller creatures can enter the corpse, with Large creatures having to squeeze to fit unless they have a burrow speed. Creatures inside the corpse have three-quarters cover from effects outside the corpse.

### The Wolverine's Tactics
The burning rage wolverine relies on sheer ferocity to defeat their opponents. While in one-on-one combat, it will always employ its Reckless attack feature, so long as it is outnumbered, it will avoid using this option.

It will use its legendary Move actions to close the distance with opponents. Once in range, it relies on its Slash legendary action to initiate melee combat. If its opponents prove to be evasive or are out of reach, the wolverine will prioritize recharging its Sulfur Spray ability.

### Aftermath
The wolverine is extremely protective of the corpse as it is a high-value food source, and will fight to the death to protect it. If the players flee, it won't chase them beyond the area shown in the map. 

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be harvested from the wolverine's remains. If the players are after valuable remains left by the worm, you can have them harvest 1d4(2) items worth 1000gp each or 3d6(10) items worth 200gp each (your choice.) These items could range from choice bones to intact pieces of hide or rare organs.

#### XP Award: 10,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the wolverine can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players find an especially clever way of accomplishing their goal without having to engage in a prolonged fight with the wolverine.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the wolverine without taking much damage or expending many resources, and none of the players drop to 0 hit points.
* **50% XP:** The players defeat the wolverine, but one or more of their party members was dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating the wolverine or accomplishing their goal.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-7).** Replace the burning rage wolverine alpha with a burning rage wolverine. Change the XP award to 5,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 12-14).** Replace the burning rage wolverine alpha with a pair of burning rage wolverines (each starting at one of the W marks on the encounter map.) Change the XP award to 15,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Worm's Harvest:** If the players are there to harvest parts of the frost worm, they may find that the worm's remains are coveted by various factions. This could lead to encounters with rival hunters, black market dealers, or even a cult that reveres such creatures. |
|  2  | **The Corpse Shelter:** If the players are taking shelter within the remains, they might have to defend their holdout from other predators or elemental creatures attracted to the site. This could lead to a series of defensive battles as they fortify a temporary base.|
|  3  | **The Worm's Last Meal:** Inside the worm, the players find clues about its last meal â€“ such as a unique creature or object that points them towards a new adventure, like a map to a hidden location or a key to a forgotten dungeon. |
|  4  | **Chasing the Flames:** The elemental wolverine is part of a larger phenomenon of fiery creatures appearing in cold environments. The players are tasked with investigating these occurrences, leading them to an unstable rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire, which continues to grow. |

> ***Choking Smog.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the one more creatures with this ability must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) fire damage and is poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 12), the creature is stunned until the poison ends. A creature that has resistance to fire damage has advantage on the saving throw, and a creature that is immune to fire damage automatically succeeds. A creature that has vulnerability to fire damage has disadvantage on the saving throw.
>
> ***Implacable.*** The wolverine has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, stunned, paralyzed, or incapacitated.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The wolverine has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Reckless.*** At the start of its turn, the wolverine can gain advantage on all melee weapon attack rolls during that turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start of its next turn.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The wolverine makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 13 (2d12) fire damage.
>
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage plus 6 (1d12) fire damage.
>
> ***Sulfur Spray (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** The wolverine releases a spray of burning fumes from its rear in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and 14 (4d6) fire damage and is covered in the toxic spray for the next minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't covered in spray. Until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the spray off itself or another creature, it has the wolverine's Choking Smog ability (the creature is subjected to its own Choking Smog at the start of each of its turns).

### Burning Rage Wolverine Loot
Being elementals, most of a burning rage wolverine's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the burnt stone and ashes it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Burning Rage Wolverine Loot Table
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
