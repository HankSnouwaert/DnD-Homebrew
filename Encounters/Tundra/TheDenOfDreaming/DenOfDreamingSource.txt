## The Den of Dreaming  <br> (Player Level: 7-9)
In this encounter, the players must attempt to wake a hibernating werebear trapped in a nightmare whose tormented psychic projections assail any that approach. 

### Encounter Context
The players may have stumbled upon the dreaming werebear or have been sent to awaken him by someone who has sensed his peril. Regardless of the circumstances, the players should be made aware of their objective of awakening the werebear before the encounter begins.

Depending on the circumstances of the werebear's nightmare state, the players may be tasked with killing him to end his suffering if he is too far gone, or they may simply need to reduce him to 0 hit points to jar him from the nightmare.

### Lead Up
The den possesses enchantments that alert those sleeping within to the presence of intruders. However, those within will not automatically learn the intruders' location and number. The confused inhabitants of the den will immediately attack any intruders they can find.

### The Bear's Tactics
During the fight, the werebear dream walker will be unconscious and using his Dream Walk ability. His projections and the other creatures in the den will prioritize keeping the players from attacking the dream walker.

Below are some quick tips to keep in mind.

#### Bear & Werebear Tactics
Bears and werebears have fairly straightforward tactics that mostly involve charging straight at their prey. Werebears will prioritize neutralizing foes that can negate their regeneration and avoid using their bite to prevent their curse from spreading.

#### Dream Walker Projection Tactics
&emsp;**Human Projection:** This avatar focuses on utilizing dream spears against backline spellcasters to prevent them from casting spells.

**Bear Projection:** This avatar concentrates on repelling melee combatants attempting to approach the sleeping werebear.

### Aftermath
The projections, along with the other creatures in the den, will fight to the death trying to stop the players from awakening the dream walker. If the dream walker is reduced to 0 hit points, they will be pacified and may fall unconscious, flee, or become friendly to the players (your choice.)


If the players flee, the creatures that were sleeping in the den will return to their slumber, but the dream walker's projects will continue to pursue the players. The dream walker will continue to send his projects every day to chase after the players if they remain near the den.

#### Loot 
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be looted or harvested from the remains of any slain creatures. 

If this is a major encounter part of a larger adventure, you can also award the players part of, if not an entire treasure hoard of the appropriate level. This treasure hoard could be made up of valuables the werebears have stored in the den over the long years.

#### XP Award: 6,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the stopping the dream walker can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the dream walker while sparing the other creatures within the den.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the dream walker and slay the other creatures in the den.
* **50% XP:** The players manage to slay the other creatures in the den but flee the dream walker's projections.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating any of the creatures in the den.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-6).** Remove the brown bears. Change the XP award to 4,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 10-12).** Replace the brown bears with werebears. Change the XP award to 13,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Spreading Nightmare:** The dream walker has gone mad and is communing with other bears in his hibernated state, causing them to become more violent. |
|  2  | **The Dream Curse:** The dream walker has been ensnared in an eternal dream state by a vindictive hag, casting a sleeping curse over a nearby town as well. Only by defeating the dream walker can they awaken him and lift the curse enveloping the town. |
|  3  | **Gateway of Nightmares:** Nightmarish creatures from other realms are infiltrating the mortal world through the dreams of the dream walker. As these horrors begin to overrun the area, the adventurers must defeat the dream walker to sever this connection.  |
|  4  | **The Champion's Slumber:** The dream walker is an ancient champion who is awakened in times of need to protect the land. However, he's been asleep so long that he has become lost in a dream world, unable to completely wake up, and hostile to anyone who tries to wake him. The players must defeat him so that he can truly awaken.|

If a creature is already drowsy and it fails the save, it falls unconscious until the drowsiness ends. If it takes any non-psychic damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the drowsy creature, the effect ends.
>
> ***Dream Walk (1/Day).*** The werebear falls unconscious for 8 hours and gains 75 temporary hit points that last until it wakes up. While asleep, its Regeneration feature can't be stopped by psychic or silvered weapons. It wakes up once it loses the temporary hit points, or it can choose to end the sleep at the start of its turn. When the werebear falls asleep, it creates two psychic projections of itself in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of it, one in its bear form and one in its humanoid form. The projections have statistics like those of a werebear in either form, except it lacks this action, the Shapechanger bonus action, and the Regeneration ability. In combat, the projections share the werebear's initiative count, going after the werebear on each round one after another. Each projection remains until it is destroyed or the werebear dies or wakes up. When destroyed, they vanish, leaving no physical trace.
> 
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Shapechanger.*** The werebear can use its action to polymorph into a Large bear-humanoid hybrid or into a Large bear, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.


> ##### Projections Without The Werebear
>It is possible that the players may encounter the psychic projections of the werebear before ever seeing the actual werebear itself.  If they do, each projection is a CR 5 creature when not with the werebear.

\columnbreak

> ##### The Drowsy Condition
> This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
> &#8226; It moves at half speed.<br>
> &#8226; It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
> &#8226; It can't concentrate. <br>
> &#8226; Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
> &#8226; The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

### Bear Loot

The valuable items looted from bears will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Because lycanthropes revert to their humanoid form when they are slain, most of the valuable items players can collect from werebears will be worn items or items dropped nearby. These valuables may include standard coinage. These items can be found using a **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
