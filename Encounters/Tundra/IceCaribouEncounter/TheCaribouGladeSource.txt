## The Caribou Glade  <br> (Player Level: 11-12)
In this encounter, the players enter a winter glade populated by icy caribou under the thrall of a wicked crone. Can they defeat the crone and free the hostile caribou without harming them?

### Encounter Context
The players may have been tasked with freeing the caribou under the crone's control, or they may have stumbled across the glade with the enslaved caribou while traveling. Even if they didn't arrive with prior knowledge about the caribou, it should be clear to them the caribou are under the crone's control. You could show this by showing glowing magical chains around each of the caribou's necks and describing their unnaturally vacant expressions. 

### Lead Up
The players will have a chance to sneak up to the woodline at the edge of the glade, but there is not sufficient cover for them to sneak out into the glade. The crone will command her caribou to attack as soon as the players are detected.

### Running the Encounter
The caribou will remain hostile to the players until both the crone and her sled are destroyed. Until then, they will work in tandem to bring down the players.

Alternatively, if the players use a 4th level or higher *dispel magic* spell on a caribou, it will be freed of its mind control.

#### The Crone's Tactics
While riding her sled, the crone employs hit-and-run strategies, utilizing the caribou pulling it to ram into vulnerable targets.

The sled's Hexed Cauldron ability allows it to maintain concentration on a spell for the crone. This enables her to maintain two spells that require concentration at once. Typically, the crone assigns her most powerful spell to her sled as it retains concentration unless destroyed.

**Wild Heart Trait.** This trait, when coupled with the crone riding on a sled, enables her to maintain concentration on three spells simultaneously, with the harts being prime targets for her spells. 

**Craven Scent Curse.** This curse is best targeted at frontline fighters.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Impenetrable Pelt.** The crone casts this defensive spell on herself to bolster her survivability.

**Bestial Spirit.** The summoned spirit should be positioned next to melee fighters possessing low Dexterity or targets slow enough that they can't outrun the Bestial Spirit.

<br>

&emsp;**Wild Surge.** This spell works well with the Wild Heart trait and should target the crone's most formidable minion or herself while she is in Ancient Widow Form and has lost concentration on Impenetrable Pelt.

**Summon Flock.** This spell is generally a lower priority among the crone's concentration spells. It's mostly useful when the crone doesn't have access to Impenetrable Pelt or she's scouting for enemies within her forest domain. The spell inflicts minimal damage, and its primary utility lies in disrupting the concentration of opposing spell casters.

**Amber Spear.** This spell is particularly effective when it can hit three targets simultaneously (or at least two targets with low Dexterity).


#### Caribou Tactics
The caribou will utilize hit-and-run tactics. They charge in with their horns before running out of reach to repeat the process on their next turn, using their Back Kick against anyone who makes an opportunity attack against them.

Ice Caribou will focus on bringing down anyone capable of dealing fire damage. Their ice attacks help enable their hit-and-run tactics by slowing down their targets.

\pagebreakNum

### Aftermath
If the players flee the encounter, the crone will likely pursue them if her sled is intact. This could lead to a chase encounter through the woods. If the crone is losing the fight, she may choose to flee with her herd or use them to slow the players down as she attempts to make her escape. This could also lead to a chase encounter.

If the players kill the crone or knock her unconscious and destroy her sled, the caribou will be freed.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be looted from the crone and any slain caribou. If the players are able to defeat the crone without sleighing any of the caribou, you can have them be friendly towards the players. If the players have a means of communicating with the caribou, they can disclose the location of the crone's secret stash of jewelry nearby. This jewelry can include 2d6(7) 500gp gems.


#### XP Award: 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the crone and freeing the caribou can affect their XP reward. The players earn 8,000xp by defeating the crone (or half as much if they only destroy her sled. The players earn 2,000xp for each caribou they free.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easiest Encounter (Level 5-7).** Replace the crone witch with a crone apprentice and each of the ice caribou with a moose. Additionally, a caribou can be freed of its mind control with a 3rd level *dispel magic* spell. <br> Change the XP award for defeating the crone to 3,500 XP, and the award for each moose freed is 500 XP. Additionally, change the value of the crone's gems to 50 gp each.

**Easier Encounter (Level 8-10).** Replace each of the ice caribou with a megaloceros. Additionally, a megaloceros can only be freed of its mind control with a 4th level or higher *dispel magic* spell. <br> Change the XP award for defeating the crone to 6,500 XP, and the award for each moose freed is 1,500 XP. Additionally, change the value of the crone's gems to 100 gp each.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Purging The Curse:** The wicked crone contributed to a larger curse afflicting the entire forest. Freeing the caribou is just the first step in a larger quest to lift the curse, which could involve hunting down other crones and purging more creatures and forest areas of their curse. |
|  2  | **The Winter Master:** The crone is the servant or disciple of a more powerful entity, such as a frost giant, a crone mother, or an ice dragon. Defeating her leads to clues about her master's identity and plans, drawing the players into a larger plot regarding the fate of the forest.|
|  3  | **The Caribou Curse:** The ice caribou are actually former villagers who were transformed by the crone. The players must not only defeat the crone but also find a way to reverse the transformation. |
|  4  | **The Winter Migration:** The caribou were taking part in a great migration before being enslaved by the crone. Now the players must follow them along their migratory route, protecting them from further threats. |

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.

\pagebreakNum

#### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, chariots are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The chariot may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by steeds.

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.



#### Bestial Spirit

*4th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.


\pagebreakNum

#### Summon Flock

*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V, S, M (A worm or bug)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon casting, you summon three crows that circle above you for the duration of the spell. As a bonus action, you can direct one of the crows to dive at a creature or object within 120 feet.

## Crone Witch Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from crone witches come in the form of items they wear or carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### Crone Witch Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Caribou Loot
The valuable items looted from caribou will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Most of an ice caribou's form will melt away when it is destroyed. Players can loot the insolvable bits of ice and melt water it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Caribou Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
