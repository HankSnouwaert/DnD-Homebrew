## Caribou Encounter  <br> (Player Level: 11-12)
In this encounter, the players are given the chance to free a herd of ice caribou under the thrall of a wicked crone.

### Encounter Context
The players may have been tasked with freeing the caribou under the crone's control, or they may have stumbled across the glade with the enslaved caribou while traveling. Even if they didn't arrive with prior knowledge about the caribou, it should be clear to them the caribou are under the crone's control. You could show this by showing glowing magical chains around each of the caribou's necks and describing their unnaturally vacant expressions. (NOTE: Dispel magic should be able to free them)

### Lead Up
The players will have a chance to sneak up to the woodline at the edge of the glade, but there is not sufficient cover for them to sneak out into the glade. The crone will command her caribou to attack as soon as the players are detected.

### Running the Encounter
The caribou will remain hostile to the players until both the crone and her sled are destroyed. Until then, they will work in tandem to bring down the players.

#### The Crone's Tactics
While riding her sled, the crone employs hit-and-run strategies, utilizing the caribou pulling it to ram into vulnerable targets.

The sled's Hexed Cauldron ability allows it to maintain concentration on a spell for the crone. This enables her to maintain two spells that require concentration at once. Typically, the crone assigns her most powerful spell to her sled as it retains concentration unless destroyed.

**Wild Heart Trait.** This trait, when coupled with the crone riding on a sled, enables her to maintain concentration on three spells simultaneously, with the harts being prime targets for her spells. 

**Craven Scent Curse.** This curse is best targeted at frontline fighters.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Impenetrable Pelt.** The crone casts this defensive spell on herself to bolster her survivability.

**Bestial Spirit.** The summoned spirit should be positioned next to melee fighters possessing low Dexterity or targets slow enough that they can't outrun the Bestial Spirit.

**Wild Surge.** This spell works well with the Wild Heart trait and should target the crone's most formidable minion or herself while she is in Ancient Widow Form and has lost concentration on Impenetrable Pelt.

**Summon Flock.** This spell is generally a lower priority among the crone's concentration spells. It's mostly useful when the crone doesn't have access to Impenetrable Pelt or she's scouting for enemies within her forest domain. The spell inflicts minimal damage, and its primary utility lies in disrupting the concentration of opposing spell casters.

**Amber Spear.** This spell is particularly effective when it can hit three targets simultaneously (or at least two targets with low Dexterity).


#### Caribou Tactics
The caribou will utilize hit-and-run tactics. They charge in with their horns before running out of reach to repeat the process on their next turn, using their Back Kick against anyone who makes an opportunity attack against them.

Ice Caribou will focus on bringing down anyone capable of dealing fire damage. Their ice attacks help enable their hit-and-run tactics by slowing down their targets.

### Aftermath
If the players flee the encounter, the crone will likely pursue them if her sled is intact. This could lead to a chase encounter through the woods. If the crone is losing the fight, she may choose to flee with her herd or use them to slow the players down as she attempts to make her escape. This could also lead to a chase encounter.

If the players kill the crone or knock her unconscious and destroy her sled, the caribou will be freed.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be looted from the crone and any slain caribou. If the players are able to defeat the crone without sleighing any of the caribou, you can have them be friendly towards the players. If the players have a means of communicating with the caribou, they can disclose the location of the crone's secret stash of jewelry nearby. This jewelry can include 2d6(7) 500gp gems.


#### XP Award: 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the crone and freeing the caribou can affect their XP reward. The players earn 8,000xp by defeating the crone (or half as much if they only destroy her sled.) The players earn 2,000xp for each caribou they free.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easiest Encounter (Level 5-7).** Replace the crone witch with a crone apprentice and each of the ice caribou with a moose. Change the XP award for defeating the crone to 3,500 XP, and the award for each moose freed is 500 XP. Additionally, change the value of the crone's gems to 50 gp each.

**Easier Encounter (Level 8-10).** Replace each of the ice caribou with a megaloceros. Change the XP award for defeating the crone to 6,500 XP, and the award for each moose freed is 1,500 XP. Additionally, change the value of the crone's gems to 100 gp each.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Worm's Harvest:** If the players are there to harvest parts of the purple worm, they may find that the worm's remains are coveted by various factions. This could lead to encounters with rival hunters, black market dealers, or even a cult that reveres such creatures. |
|  2  | **The Corpse Shelter:** If the players are taking shelter within the remains, they might have to defend their holdout from other predators or elemental creatures attracted to the site. This could lead to a series of defensive battles as they fortify a temporary base.|
|  3  | **The Worm's Last Meal:** Inside the worm, the players find clues about its last meal â€“ such as a unique creature or object that points them towards a new adventure, like a map to a hidden location or a key to a forgotten dungeon. |
|  4  | **Chasing the Flames:** The elemental wolverine is part of a larger phenomenon of fiery creatures appearing in cold environments. The players are tasked with investigating these occurrences, leading them to an unstable rift to the Elemental Plane of Fire, which continues to grow. |

On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) fire damage and is poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 12), the creature is stunned until the poison ends. A creature that has resistance to fire damage has advantage on the saving throw, and a creature that is immune to fire damage automatically succeeds. A creature that has vulnerability to fire damage has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and 14 (4d6) fire damage and is covered in the toxic spray for the next minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't covered in spray. Until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the spray off itself or another creature, it has the wolverine's Choking Smog ability (the creature is subjected to its own Choking Smog at the start of each of its turns).

### Burning Rage Wolverine Loot
Being elementals, most of a burning rage wolverine's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the burnt stone and ashes it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Burning Rage Wolverine Loot Table
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
