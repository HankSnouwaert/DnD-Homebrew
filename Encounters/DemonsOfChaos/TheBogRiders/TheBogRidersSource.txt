## The Bog Riders <br> (Player Level: 9-11)
In this encounter, the players find themselves traveling through a blighted swamp where they attract the attention of a trio of fester toads, each being ridden by a plaguebringer.

### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players are traveling through a bog currently home to demons of decay. The players may be aware of the demonic presence in the swamp, or they may be blissfully unaware and simply trying to pass to the other side. 

### Lead Up
This encounter begins with the players making their way through a fetid swamp. They will notice the bog riders just before they hop into the locations shown on the map. Because the bog riders will move in as quickly as possible rather than using stealth, none of the player characters should be surprised. The players should start the encounter roughly in the center of the map.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** This depends on the time of day, but the bog riders will most likely attack at dusk or night when there is low light or total darkness.
* **Bog Rider Starting Areas (TR).** The bog riders should start the encounter at roughly these locations.
* **Water’s Edge (Light Green Border).** These lines represent the threshold between land that can be walked on and water deep enough to require characters to swim.
* **Swamp Debris (Orange Border).** This area is difficult terrain.
* **Reeds (Purple Border).** This area is difficult terrain, and creatures within it are lightly obscured.  The reeds also provide half-cover against ranged attacks.
* **Rotting Trees (Red Border.** These trees provide total cover and can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.



### The Battle
The plaguebringers and fester toad steeds will use the swampy terrain to their advantage and attempt to outmaneuver the players, separating and picking them off, using tongue and bite attacks to grapple and pull players into unfavorable terrain. Separating players in this way also makes it harder for them to free anyone who has been swallowed. 

### Aftermath
The attacking demons have no sense of self-preservation; their only goal is to slay all the players. A toad controlled by a plaguebringer will only flee if it has swallowed a player and wants to separate that character from the rest of the group. Otherwise, the plaguebringers and the toads under their control will fight to the death.

Fester toads that lose their rider will become interested in escaping with the easiest meal possible. If the players flee, the demons will pursue them until they escape the swamp. 

#### Loot
As a stand-alone fight in the wilderness, this encounter doesn't need to yield loot beyond what the players can get by harvesting items using the guidelines found later in the document. If you wish to provide additional treasure, you can have each toad carry 1d6 x 100 GP in its belly from previously devoured travelers. 

#### XP Award: 8,500xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the demons can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.
 
* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the demons using excellent tactics that prevent them from wasting resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the demons, but with some amount of struggle.
* **50% XP:** The players defeat at least half the demons, but then flee.
* **10% XP:** The players flee after defeating less than half the demons.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.
 
**Easier Encounter (Levels 6-8).** The players are attacked by fester toads without any riders. Change the XP award to 6,000xp.
 
**Harder Encounter (Levels 12-14).** Replace the fester toads with bog barons.  Change the XP award to 10,000xp, and double the gold carried by the toads.




### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The demons the players encountered were a scouting party leading the way for a larger demonic force traveling through the bog. |
|  2  | A demonic infestation has taken hold in the swamp, spawning demons of decay who seek to spread the infection.|
|  3  | A group of mad cultists has taken refuge in the swamp and summoned demons to deter intruders. |
|  4  | A great unclean one has created a lair within the swamp and sends its minions to collect living samples to aid in its unholy experiments.|

## New Creatures
### Plaguebringers


These fiends are created from the souls of mortals who have succumbed  to demonic diseases. Their shambling humanoid bodies are bloated, rotten, and nearly zombie-like in appearance. Each of these fiends wields a rusted plaguesword, which carries the same disease that originally birthed it and is used to continue the proliferation of its kind. Those wounded by the sword risk contracting Abyssal Rot, a fiendish disease that transforms those who succumb to it into other plaguebringers.

Plaguebringers feel the responsibility not just to spread disease but to count and catalog all diseases they encounter in hopes of establishing a complete record of every pathogen in existence. Despite the impossible nature of this task, these neurotic fiends can often be heard counting illnesses they spot on the battlefield, groaning in frustration every time a distraction causes them to lose count.   

<br>

> ##### The Dazed Condition & Abyssal Rot
> Several of the abilities of these demons inflict the Dazed condition. A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.<br> Additionally, many of these creatures can inflict the Abyssal Rot disease, whose description is found in the Disease Mechanics section of this document.

> ***Fetid Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the plaguebringer must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the plaguebringer’s next turn.

The save DC equals the highest save DC among the demons of decay plus 1 per saving throw that was forgone.

### Fester Toads
These wretched fiends appear as giant, mutant, <br> disease-ridden toads with one or more boney horns protruding from their bulbous heads. Their rotting <br> skin is always sloughing off of them and spreads <br> terrible diseases to those who come in contact with it.

Fester toads spawn in the vilest swamps of the <br> demon realms. There, they lazily waddle and hop <br> about, looking for the next easy meal while avoiding <br> the attention of more powerful demons. The desire <br> to avoid the wrath of other demons while finding <br> easy prey leads fester toads to leap at any chance to <br> cross into the mortal realm. Here they take up residence <br>  in foul sewers and fetid swamps, feeding on humanoids <br> at every opportunity while spreading filth and disease in <br>  their wake.

Demonic cultists of decay will often summon plague <br> toads to serve as guardians in their lairs, and when  other demons of decay launch large-scale attacks, they will often herd knots of fester toads into battle alongside them. <br>  Some plaguebringer demons even catch fester toads for themselves and put them to use as combat mounts. Though they aren't the fastest of steeds, fester toads can leap over obstacles and ram foes with their boney horns, knocking prey off their feet before quickly gobbling them up.

***Swamp Sires.*** Though all fester toads are bloated bags of disease, these toads have been blessed with a particularly potent disease that radiates from the toad's rotting skin in a vile miasma. This disease is commonly referred to as "wasting sickness" and withers away the muscle mass of its victims, eventually weakening them to the point where they can no longer breath or beat their heart.

\columnbreak

Carrying this disease marks these fester toads with a higher status in their swamp homes, thus earning them the nickname of swamp sires. Plaguebringers see the swamp sires as particularly valuable mounts, and those who have successfully captured them will form elite gangs of fetid shock cavalry.

### Demon of Decay Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Demon of Decay Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
