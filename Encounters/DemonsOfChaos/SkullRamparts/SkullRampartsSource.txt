## The Skull Rampart  <br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this encounter, the players assist a group of soldiers in assaulting a fiendish citadel guarded by bloodrender demons and their hellish skull cannons.

### Encounter Context
This encounter could occur on another fiendish plane of existence or the Material Plane. Additionally, the players have been assigned to aid the group of soldiers assaulting the citadel, or they may have found the soldiers by chance while investigating the citadel themselves. In any case, it is clear to the players that the soldiers, though stubborn and stalwart, are outmatched and will need help if they are to have any chance of surviving their assault. 

Examples of reasons the soldiers are assaulting the citadel can be found in the Adventure Tie-Ins section on the next page.

### The Soldiers
The soldiers use the stats of veterans. When the players arrive, the soldiers will allow the players to take charge and are open to following their tactical advice. However, they are very reluctant to retreat so long as they think they have a chance. If they find themselves without backup, are outnumbered, or witness one of their comrades eaten and digested by a skull cannon, you can have them make a DC 15 Wisdom save. On a failure, they become frightened and attempt to flee the encounter in the most tactically sound way possible.

### The Demons
Below are some tactics to keep in mind when running the demons.

### Bloodrender Tactics
Bloodrenders are nimble melee shock troops. Below are some tips for using them most effectively:
* Keep them in groups to maximize the effectiveness of their Murderous Tide ability. 
* They are fragile, so strike hard and fast. 
* They have high attack bonuses, so you can use them to bring down tanky targets with high AC.
* Make sure the bloodrenders give the skull cannons space to move in and charge the players.

#### Exalted & Hellforged Bloodrenders
* Try to trigger Hungering Blade by attacking whoever is the closest to 0 hit points.
* Have the bloodthirsters work together to trigger Hungering Blade with their Merciless Tide ability.

### Skull Cannon Tactics
Below are the general attack sequences the skull cannon will follow. 

**While the skull cannon has Burning Skull available:**
1. Fire Burning Skull at the largest group of opponents; if there are no opponents grouped together, fire at the opponent that appears the least dexterous.
2. Charge at a nearby enemy that appears to have low Strength and Dexterity and attempt to swallow it (the soldiers are usually the highest priority).
3. Repeat the above steps until Burning Skull is no longer available.

**While Burning Skull is not available:**
1. Use Reckless Drift at the largest group of enemies the skull cannon can reach.
2. Follow this up with an attempt to swallow a soldier. 
3. Repeat the above steps until Burning Skull is available.

### Aftermath
The encounter will only end when all the participants of one side have been slain, or the players have fled. The demons will fight to the death and relentlessly pursue the players if they flee. (NOTE: Should they stay to guard the rampart?)

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be harvested from the demons' remains. Because the goal of this encounter is to make it up the ramparts in one piece, there likely won't be much opportunity to provide additional immediate treasure. However, you could have the players stumble upon an armory with valuables soon after this encounter, which could contain a treasure hoard's worth of goods.

#### XP Award: 12,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the demons can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the demons and make it up the ramparts without taking much damage or expending many resources and without any of the soldiers dying.
* **100% XP:** The players make it up the ramparts, but they end up taking heavy damage during the fight, or one or two of the soldiers are killed.
* **50% XP:** Either the players defeat all the bloodrenders or the skull cannon, but they retreat back the way they came rather than cross the bridge, or they defeat all the demons, but every soldier dies. 
* **10% XP:** The players retreat back the way they came without defeating all the bloodrenders or the skull cannon.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. <br><br>

**Easier Encounter (Level 7-9).** Replace the exalted bloodrenders with bloodrenders. Change the XP award to 6,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace the exalted bloodrenders with hellforged bloodrenders. Change the XP award to 20,000 XP.



### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Prisoners of War:** The soldiers are on a rescue mission to release their comrades who have been taken prisoner. The players must help them get to the prisoners of war before they become victims of a blood sacrifice. |
|  2  | **Planar Beachhead:** The ramparts are part of a demonic beachhead on the Material Plane, and inside, the demons are opening a planar rift that will allow reinforcements through. The players must help the soldiers destroy the ramparts before demons overwhelm their position. |
|  3  | **Ramparts Capture:** The assault on the ramparts is part of an invasion against demon-held territory (possibly on their home plan.) The players and the soldiers must capture the ramparts so they can be used as a staging point for future attacks.  |
|  4  | **Trading One Dark Master For Another:** The soldiers are secretly cultists worshiping a rival demon lord. Once the players help them secure the ramparts, they turn it to the service of a new demonic horde.|

>
> ***Burning Skull (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The skull cannon targets a point 30 to 300 feet away from it that it or a creature mounted on it can see, and fires a burning skull. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage plus 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
>
> If the Skull Cannon uses this action, creatures outside the Skull Cannon can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach.
>
> ***Reckless Drift.*** The skull cannon makes a Ram attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of it that are not mounted on it, with a separate attack roll for each target. Its speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn, and all attack rolls against the skull cannon have advantage until the start of its next turn. (NOTE: Can it move before using this?)
>
> ***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the skull cannon moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, it can make a Bite attack against the same target as a bonus action, whether it hit or missed.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the skull cannon. A swallowed creature is Blinded and Restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the skull cannon, and it takes 7 (2d6) fire damage plus 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the skull cannon's turns. The skull cannon regains hit points equal to the damage dealt (NOTE: From the bite, or from creatures inside it?). If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and is turned to ash, and the skull cannon regains a use of its Burning Skull ability if the creature was Small or larger and had a skull.
>
> The Skull Cannon can have up to three targets swallowed at a time. A creature trapped inside the skull cannon can make a DC 17 Strength check as an action. On a success, one swallowed creature of their choice is freed, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the skull cannon. If the skull cannon dies, a swallowed creature is no longer Restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

### Demon Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Demon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
