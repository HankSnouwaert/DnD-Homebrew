## Archive of Infinite Doors <br> (Player Level: 15-20)
In this encounter, the players enter a fiendish library chamber with large arcane tomes whose pages are portals that spawn waves of attacking demons of change.

### Encounter Context
The encounter takes place in a demonic library, located either in an alternate plane of existence or within the inner sanctum of a demonic cult. It serves as an excellent final fight for a larger dungeon crawl.

### Lead Up
The library contains three massive books with constantly flipping pages that display glimpses of other worlds. If players investigate the books, demons begin to pour out of their pages.

### The Demon Waves
The encounter features three waves of demons. Demons can enter through any of the portal-tomes in the room. They have knowledge of the current room conditions and choose their points of entry strategically. Each subsequent wave enters two rounds after the previous one, on initiative count 1, and rolls for initiative in the next combat round.

#### Wave Compositions (Player Level:15-17)
* **Wave 1:** 4 Pink Terrors of Change and 1 Iridescent Terror
* **Wave 2:** 4 Screechers of Change
* **Wave 3:** 1 Master of Change

**XP Award:** 25,000 XP

#### Wave Compositions (Player Level:17-19)
* **Wave 1:** 4 Exalted Pink Terrors of Change and 1 Iridescent Terror
* **Wave 2:** 6 Screechers of Change
* **Wave 3:** 1 Exalted Master of Change

**XP Award:** 40,000 XP

#### Wave Compositions (Player Level:20)
* **Wave 1:** 4 Iridescent Terrors of Change and 1 Herald of Change
* **Wave 2:** 6 Thunderous Screechers
* **Wave 3:** The Golden Griffin

**XP Award:** 65,000 XP

### Aftermath
The demons will fight to the death and will happily chase the players if they flee the chamber. If the players defeat all the demons, this would be a good situation for them to uncover an arcane treasure hoard of the appropriate level.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Worlds Within Pages.** The players are exploring the library for means to travel to another world, and tomes in this chamber possess the means to do so. |
|  2  | **Demonic Recruits.** The portals in this chamber are providing demonic reinforcements to a fiendish army, and the players have been sent to shut it down. |
|  3  | **Forbidden Prize.** A fiendish warlock or demon seeks the tomes in this chamber, and the players have arrived to attempt to take them before they can fall into sinister hands. |
|  4  | **Beacon of Madness.** A wizard's library has inadvertently become an inter-planar beacon for demons who've begun using the texts within as a means of crossing into the Material Plane, and it's up to the players to stop the madness. |

### Demon Tactics
The following are tips on using different types of demons to their full potential in combat.

#### Terror of Change Tactics
Pink terrors should group together to maximize their Growing Flames trait, slowly advancing toward the enemy as they become wounded. When they split, the blue and brimstone terrors will move into melee range. Even unwounded pink terrors should move closer to keep benefitting from Growing Flames, as blue and brimstone terrors will still trigger this ability.

##### Exalted Pink Terrors of Change
Exalted terrors can use the Arcane Mirth ability instead of attacking to empower a more powerful ally, such as an iridescent terror, or to reposition enemies away from advantageous spots.

##### Blazing Terrors of Change
Blazing terrors can use both Conduit of Infinity and Greater Arcane Mirth to create devastating, high-accuracy attacks. If other blazing terrors or stronger demons are present, they will use these abilities to empower the stronger demon. Blazing terrors will only empower themselves if they have 40 or more hit points, as they likely won’t survive long enough to benefit otherwise.

##### Iridescent Terrors and Heralds of Change
These demons should be accompanied by other Demons of Change to benefit from their Locus ability. You can use the following guidelines when determining how to use their spells:

**Glean Magic:** Used immediately on the first full caster they see.

**Fireball/Fire Storm:** Cast if two targets with low Dexterity saves can be hit, or if three or more such targets can be hit (in which case this should be used before Glean Magic).

**Bolt of Change:** Targets creatures with low Charisma saving throws. The odds of hitting should be boosted by weaker minions (e.g., Blue or Brimstone Terrors) using the Help action or an Exalted Terror using Arcane Mirth.


##### *Locus of Change Abilities*
&emsp;**Locus of Abjuration.**  The terror and its minions within the locus should use hit-and-run tactics, attempting to make sure they do not take too much damage in one turn. 

**Locus of Evocation.** Does not greatly affect the terror's tactics

**Locus of Transmogrification.** This locus is most dangerous when paired with swarms of other demons. The brimstone terrors spawned from this ability can be used to boost the terror's Growing Flames ability.

\columnbreak

#### Screecher of Change Tactics
Screechers will disengage if they can move past three or more targets. They will attack if they can avoid effective opportunity attacks, targeting creatures with high AC or large size.

##### Thunderous Screecher
Thunderous Screechers follow similar tactics but prioritize flying past melee fighters when disengaging. They may save their bite attack for creatures capable of making effective opportunity attacks. They will use *thunderwave* if it can hit three or more targets or help it avoid opportunity attacks.

### Masters of Change Tactics

Masters of Change make decisions with near-perfect knowledge of the enemy's capabilities. They cast the following spells based on situational need:

**Banishment**: Use if Dominate Monster has already been used.

**Bolt of Change:** Cast when AoE options are limited, and concentration is already used. Prioritized over Banishment if it has advantage on the attack roll.

**Counterspell:** Reactions are reserved to use this to disrupt enemy spells.

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when wounded (below 50 HP).

**Dispel Magic:** Cast when a high-level spell prevents it from acting.

**Dominate Monster:** Cast when there aren’t enough targets for AoE spells, and concentration is free.

**Fireball:** Cast when two or more low-Dexterity targets or three total targets are present, and concentration is already used.

**Firestorm:** Cast when three or more low-Dexterity targets or four total targets can be hit.

**Firewall:** Cast when two or more low-Dexterity targets or three total targets can be hit.

**Glean Magic:** Cast when no AoE spells are viable, and it’s concentrating on another spell.

**Invisibility:** Used for ambushes or if unable to teleport to safety.

**Prismatic Spray:** Same conditions as Firestorm.

#### Exalted Masters of Change Tactics

Exalted masters of change have access to the Lore Strike legendary action and can use the following guidelines when deciding which lore to use:

**Fire:** The strongest option, especially with Warp Flame.

**Light:** Used on targets it plans to attack next turn.

**Beast:** Used when forced into melee and unable to escape.

**Metal and Life:** Pushes or pulls creatures into a *firewall* spell.

**Heavens:** Used on spellcasters concentrating on 4th-level or higher spells.

**Shadow:** Targets creatures more than 60 feet away.

**Death:** Targets low-HP creatures for potential knockouts on the next turn.

\pagebreakNum

#### The Golden Master Tactics
The Golden Master has different spells compared to other Masters of Change and uses them with the following strategies in mind:

**Bolt of Change:** Cast when AoE spells aren’t effective, and the Master is already concentrating on other spells. This spell is prioritized over Banishment if it has advantage on the attack roll.

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when the Master is badly wounded (below 50 HP).

**Dispel Magic:** Used when a spell is preventing the Master from taking its full action.

**Dominate Monster:** Cast when there aren't enough targets for AoE spells, and the Master is not concentrating on the maximum number of spells. It will attempt to hit the creature with its staff before casting this spell.

**Final Transformation:** Targeted at spellcasters, preferably those who can cast Greater Restoration.

**Firestorm:** Cast when it can hit three or more targets with low Dexterity or four targets overall.

**Fire Wall:** Cast when it can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity or three targets overall.

**Glean Magic:** Cast when there are not enough AoE targets, and the Master is already concentrating on a spell. Targets for Bolt of Change may also be selected.

**Molten Silver:** Used when it can hit two or more low-Dexterity targets or three targets overall, and the Master is already concentrating on the maximum number of spells.

**Plague of Rust:** Used to target the weapons of martial classes when there aren't enough AoE targets and the Master is concentrating on spells.

**Invisibility:** Utilized for ambushing, or when the Master cannot teleport away to safety.

##### Legendary Actions
The Golden Master uses its Golden Bolt as frequently as possible. It uses Searing Gold whenever there are multiple targets covered in gold.

### New Spells


#### Bolt of Change
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation (condition described at end of document).


#### Final Transmutation
*9th-level transmutation*


- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bar of lead)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

You speak a word of power that transforms a creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is petrified, turning to gold until the spell ends. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

**Ending The Effect.** A petrified target can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell, it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed* with the petrified creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

**Damaging A Petrified Creature.** If a petrified creature is physically damaged or broken during this state, it will manifest the same damage upon being reverted to its original form.



#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

#### Molten Silver
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A small piece of sliver)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Artificer
___

A line of searing liquid silver up to 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. At the end of the line, the silver spreads out into a 30-foot cone emanating in the direction of the line. Each creature in the line or cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

#### Plague of Rust
*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of gold thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\columnbreak

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
