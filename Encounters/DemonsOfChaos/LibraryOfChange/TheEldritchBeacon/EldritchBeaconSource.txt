##### Encounter Map: Beacon Platform


<br><br><br><br>

## The Eldritch Beacon  <br> (Player Level: 6-8)
In this encounter, the players enter an extradimensional chamber housing a beacon drawing in demons of change from across the Multiverse. The players must destroy the beacon with a sacred dagger while fighting off waves of incoming demons across two mirrored versions of the beacon chamber.

### Encounter Setup
The players know that their mission is to destroy the beacon using the sacred holy dagger in their possession. They may have been given this mission by a holy order or taken it upon themselves. Likewise, a holy order may have provided them with the holy dagger, or perhaps the players had to seek it out beforehand. 

In any case, the players should have the following knowledge before entering the chamber to destroy the beacon:

**Beacon Vulnerability.** The demonic beacon is invulnerable to all damage except from the holy dagger. To destroy the beacon, the dagger must be stabbed into it as an action and left there for six rounds. The rounds do not need to be consecutive but must occur within the same hour.

##### Encounter Map: Beacon Platform Mirror Realm


##### Chamber Features
* <font color="Blue">**Blue Area:** This is the platform holding the beacon as it drifts through an extradimensional space between the layers of The Abyss </font>
* <font color="Teal">**Teal Areas:** These represent elevation changes. </font>
* <font color="red">**Red Area:** This is the bottomless extradimensional space between the layers of Abyss. Falling into it will cause a creature to eventually end up in a random location in the Abyss. </font>
* <font color="918007">**Yellow Line:** This is the threshold of the gate leading into and out of the chamber. Once a player uses it to enter the chamber, they can't reenter the chamber through it for 10 minutes. </font>
* <font color="Purple">**Purple Area:** The beacon </font>


<br>


&emsp;**Demonic Interference.** Demons will invade through portals and attempt to remove the dagger. A demon can spend its action to begin pulling it out. If the demon is still alive at the start of its next turn, it can use its action again to successfully remove the dagger. (You can frame this as the dagger being difficult for the demons to handle and tell the players it will likely take a demon a little bit of time to pull out the dagger. Added). Any Demons that get their hands on the dagger will attempt to throw it into the Abyss.

**Mirrored Realm.** The beacon and its chamber exist simultaneously in two demonic planes, and so does the dagger while embedded in the beacon. Demons will invade both planes in an attempt to remove the dagger. If the dagger is removed from the beacon in one plane, the version embedded within the beacon in the other plane will disappear.

&emsp;**Optional Information: What Happens When the Beacon is Destroyed.** If the beacon is destroyed, all demons summoned by it die instantly, and the plane begins collapsing in on itself over the course of 1 minute. Any creatures that are still present afterward are cast into the Abyss. It's up to you how much of this information the players know beforehand.

### The Demonic Waves
After the players enter the beacon chamber through the portal, they should be made aware that the beacon is actively drawing in demons, who will begin arriving any second. Give them one round of combat to stab the dagger into the beacon and position themselves.

#### Determining The Attackers
At the start of each round, roll two pairs of 2d6.
* For each pair, use the first die to determine the type of demon using the appropriate Demon Table and the second to determine the numbered spawn location on the map.
* The two sets of demons will appear in two different versions of the chamber (you can choose which one appears where or determine it randomly)

#### The Demon Portals
A portal appears at each spawn location through which the demons appear, and the portals last until the start of the next round.

* Creatures can move through the portal in one version of the chamber to come out through the portal in the other. (Players should be able to tell at a glance that the portals lead to the mirrored version of the chamber.)
* Any of the invading demons can move through the portal up to once per turn.
* Non-demonic creatures take 2d6 force damage each time they use a portal.

### The Demons
If you're running the normal version of the encounter for players in the 6-8 level range, use the Normal Demon Table. If you're running this encounter for players in the 14-16 level range, use the Hard Demon Table.

##### Normal Demon Table
| 1d6  | Demon | 
|:---:|:-----------:
|  1 | Warp Fish | 
|  2 | Chaos Maw |  
|  3 | Kindle Dancer  |
|  4 | Flame Spooler |
|  5-6 | Chromatic Terror of Change | 

\columnbreak

##### Hard Demon Table
| 1d6  | Demon | 
|:---:|:-----------:
|  1 | Exalted Warp Fish | 
|  2 | Exalted Chaos Maw |  
|  3 | Exalted Kindle Dancer  |
|  4 | Exalted Flame Spooler |
|  5-6 | Sour Pink Terror of Change | 

### Aftermath
As stated earlier, if the beacon is destroyed, all demons summoned by it die instantly, and the plane begins collapsing in on itself over the course of 1 minute. Any creatures that are still present afterward are cast into the Abyss. 

At your discretion, if the players leave the chamber before destroying the beacon, they may be able to return later to make another attempt at destroying the beacon (assuming they have the dagger or can acquire another one.)

**Treasure.** If the players have been hired to destroy the beacon, those who hired them might award them a treasure hoard of the appropriate level if this was the final battle of a larger adventure. Alternatively, the destruction of the beacon might reveal a valuable magic item the players can grab before making their escape.

**XP Award.** If you're running the normal version of this encounter, award the players 6,000 XP for destroying the beacon. If you're running the hard version, award them 25,000 XP for destroying the beacon.

### New Condition: Mutated
Many creatures throughout these encounters inflict the mutated condition. When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|

### Demon Tactics
The following are tips on using different types of demons to their full potential in combat.

#### Terror of Change Tactics
Pink terrors should group together to maximize their Growing Flames trait, slowly advancing toward the enemy as they become wounded. When they split, the blue and brimstone terrors will move into melee range. Even unwounded pink terrors should move closer to keep benefitting from Growing Flames, as blue and brimstone terrors will still trigger this ability.

##### Sour and Bursting Terrors
Sour terrors follow the same tactics as pink and blue terrors, but will use Death Rush when they have 26 or fewer hit points, aiming to explode within the largest enemy group. Bursting terrors will use Death Rush if they can hit two or more targets.

##### Chromatic and Prismatic Terrors
With high resistance to elemental damage and the Chromatic Spawning ability, chromatic and prismatic terrors will typically target non-spellcasters, who pose a greater threat.

\columnbreak

#### Kindle Dancers Tactics
Kindle Dancers act as demonic rogues, prioritizing targets they can afflict with their Warp Touch ability. They avoid ending their turns in melee combat with opponents.

#### Chaos Maws Tactics
Chaos maws are straightforward in combat, targeting enemies with the lowest armor class or the largest foes they can find.

#### Flame Spoolers Tactics
Flame spoolers function as artillery, staying in the back lines and targeting the largest groups of enemies they can.

#### Warp Fish Tactics
Warp fish prioritize locking down targets, using their hypnotic gaze on backline enemies with low wisdom and grappling them once they draw close.

### Adventure Tie Ins
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure or provide more context for why the players are here, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Beacon of Madness.** A reckless wizard was experimenting with the beacon while studying the Multiverse and inadvertently ripped it into a location between planes where it now draws in demons from the Abyss. The players may have to deal with the now-mad wizard before or after destroying the beacon. |
|  2  | **Fracturing Reality.** The players have been stumbling across locations containing portals to mirrored versions of themselves housing demons of change. They trace the cause of these phenomena to the beacon, which is fracturing reality and drawing in eldrich horrors from other worlds.  |
|  3  | **Eldritch Reinforcements.** The beacon was created by a powerful demon of change to draw in reinforcements during its assault on the Material Plane. The players must destroy the beacon to stem the flow of demons before dealing with the commander. |
|  4  | **Warlocks' Gambit.** The beacon was created by mad warlocks as a means to draw demons to the Material Plane for enslavement. The players must first put a stop to the warlocks and then destroy the beacon before it can draw in more demons. |
