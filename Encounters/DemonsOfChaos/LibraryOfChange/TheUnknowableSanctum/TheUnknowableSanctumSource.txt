## The Unknowable Sanctum  <br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this adventure, the players venture through the otherworldly realm of a demonic summoner of change. 

### The Sanctum
This realm is the sanctum of the demon summoner known as Ephelym, The Unknowable. Ephelym is an inscrutable demon who travels the multiverse cataloging information on every fiendish being in existence. The information is stored in this sanctum, making it a sought-after repository of untold amounts of demonic lore. If the players can successfully navigate it, they can reach the inner sanctum where the demon known as Ephelym resides. 

More lore on Ephelym and the demons that reside here can be found in the Sanctum Denizens section.

### Resting
If the players take a short or long rest in the sanctum, you can use the following guidelines.

**Short Rest.**
If the players take a short rest in the sanctum, roll 3d8 after they finish. For each number rolled, if the corresponding encounter has not already been defeated by the players, those creatures become aware of the players' presence and move to their location to attack together.
If one or more 8s are rolled, Ephilim the Unknowable will not leave its position but will gain a realm variation (described in the Realm Variations table) of its choice. The players should sense powerful magic gathering throughout the sanctum as a warning.

**Long Rest.**
If the players take a long rest, follow the same procedure as above. However, if an encounter has already been defeated, the creatures from that encounter immediately return to life and come through the portal at the start of the sanctum.

### Encounters
Groups of demons lurk throughout the library and will attack the players on sight. The dungeon map shows where these encounters are located, and the following list describes what demons make up each encounter.

### Loot
The players should be able to find 1 or 2 level 11-16 treasure hoards spread throughout the labyrinth. This treasure can be distributed across many rooms, but a large portion should be stashed in Ephelym's chamber to be collected after it is defeated. 

### Adventure Tie Ins
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure or provide more context for why the players are here, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Fiendish Live Trials.** Ephelym has been unleashing different types of experimental demons across the Material Plane to test their capabilities, and after tracing their source, the players have come to put a stop to Ephelym's experiments. |
|  2  | **Plumbing The Unknowable.** The players find themselves facing powerful demons about which little is known. They've come to Ephelym's sanctum to defeat the demon and hopefully gather information on their fiendish foes. |
|  3  | **Forbidden Knowledge Broker.** After defeating powerful cultists with an unusually powerful command over their fiendish minions, the players learn Ephelym has been making pacts with these cultists, granting them forbidden demonic knowledge. The players must put a stop to Ephelym before it can spread this knowledge further.|
|  4  | **The Stolen Foe.** A fiendish foe fleeing the players after its defeat is captured by Ephelym and brought to the sanctum for study and cataloging. The players must enter the sanctum to defeat Ephelym and slay the captured fiend before it is released back into the Multiverse. |

### New Spells

#### Bolt of Change
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation (see Mutated condition).

\columnbreak


#### Scorching Stream
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

A line of roaring flame 50 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and you may increases line's length by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.


### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|

### Sanctum Denizens
Below are descriptions and tactics relating to the various demons that dwell within Ephelym's sanctum (and Ephelym itself).

#### Thin Summoners 
Mysterious and rare are the demons simply known as Thin Summoners: tall, spindly creatures garbed in sorcerer's robes with silver armor engraved with unthinkable patterns that boggle the minds of mortals. They possess four bony arms, each clutching esoteric implements such as tomes, trinkets, and staves, which work in conjunction to draw great currents of arcane power for the summoner to manipulate. However, the most jarring aspect of their form is their head. No two Thin Summoners share even a remotely similar visage; their heads appear as flesh twisted into living demonic symbols, with skin, eyes, and mouths grotesquely strewn across them.

***The Crystalline Towers.*** Each Thin Summoner has stewardship over a personal stronghold within the demonic realms of chaos. These strongholds, known collectively as the Crystalline Towers, are vitreous structures that drift through the ever-changing realms. They serve as fortresses and eldritch laboratories for their spellcasting masters. Anyone foolish or ill-fated enough to find themselves within one of these unholy sanctuaries must contend with endless, incomprehensible passageways alongside lesser demons collected and personally twisted by the towers' masters.

A summoner's link to their tower is so strong that, regardless of the realm they currently inhabit, they can draw demons forth from its depths. They can also imprison foes within their crystalline fortresses, making their towers both a prison and a source of power.

***Twisted Practitioners.*** Little is known about the origins of Thin Summoners, though many rumors suggest they were once human practitioners of the arcane arts. Accounts tell of an arrogant cabal that believed they could carve out their own dynasties within the realms of chaos, subjugating the demons that resided there. Ultimately, they fell victim to what any sane-minded individual would have foreseen: becoming slaves to the very power they sought to dominate.

***Spawn of Crystalline Towers.*** Though the demons within the Crystalline Towers are endless in number and highly variable in form and abilities, there are common traits among them. One might encounter a group of fish-like demons sporting a single eye and a multitude of tentacles, only to find vast differences in their capabilities. One creature might regrow its severed tentacles within seconds, while another could mutate enemies with a single glare.

Although many demons remain bound to the Thin Summoners' will, others escape their crystalline prisons, pouring out into the chaotic realms and beyond.

\columnbreak

##### Thin Summoner Tactics
Thin Summoners are fragile and rely heavily on their minions for protection, casting devastating spells from afar. When combat begins, they immediately use their bonus action to open a portal, targeting the most vulnerable opponent with low dexterity. Through this portal, demons swarm and assault the unfortunate target. The summoners then open additional portals to dispatch any foes who manage to close the distance and engage them in melee. Strategically placed portals also allow the summoners to reposition themselves easily during combat.



#### Ephelym, The Unknowable

Greatest among the cabal of thin summoners stands a sorcerer of immense power, known only as Ephelym, The Unknowable. This towering figure is always accompanied by a grotesque retinue of twisted demons. Tasked by the greater lords of change, Ephelym pursues an impossible mission: cataloging every variation of demonspawn within the lower planes.

For countless years, Ephelym has wandered the infinite realms of chaos, tirelessly chasing this futile goal. It only returns to its crystalline tower to document its findings within vast archives or to deposit particularly exotic fiends that have captured its curiosity. The fortress itself is a labyrinth of endless shelves, brimming with millions of journals, each filled with vivid descriptions of nightmares beyond mortal comprehension. Roaming the tower's halls are unspeakable abominations, birthed from the lower planes.

Demonic princes and unholy warlords often seek out Ephelym, drawn to its expertise in demonic classification. The summoner has struck many bargains with such entities, allowing them to peruse its menagerie in search of the perfect horrid creatures to suit their dark designs.

##### Ephelym Tactics

The Ephelym relies heavily on its minions and portals to avoid direct combat. It uses Power Leech on a minion that is either completely disabled (e.g., by Hold Monster or other long-term conditions) or the one with the least health.

It utilizes its legendary actions as follows:

* **Summon Abomination:** Activated whenever Ephelym has two or fewer minions. The empowered version is used if it has no minions.

* **Warp Torrent:** Deployed when it can hit three or more targets. The empowered version is used if it can hit two or more targets on the Material Plane.

* **Fires of Transformation:** Used when it has enough minions and can only hit two targets with Warp Torrent.

* **Tenacious Will**, **Teleport**, and **Check** are reserved for escaping immediate danger. Empowered versions of these abilities are used only if no other action can be safely performed.

#### Kindle Dancers
Kindle dancers are erratic fiends, their bodies consisting of a fleshy orb with a single blue eye surrounded by a ring of fangs. Numerous wiry limbs protrude from their center, each ending in large hands with multi-jointed fingers that can contort in any direction. These fiends use their limbs to move unpredictably across the battlefield, confounding enemies as they pass. All the while, their fingers execute a bewildering array of gestures to summon magical warp fire. Any foe foolish enough to allow these flame-wreathed fingers to touch them will see their flesh twist and warp before their very eyes.

##### Kindle Dancers Tactics
Kindle Dancers act as demonic rogues, prioritizing targets they can afflict with their Warp Touch ability. They avoid ending their turns in melee combat with opponents.

#### Chaos Maws
Chaos Maws embody savage disorder. These demons appear as fleshy orbs supported by several arms and legs. The center of their bodies constantly shifts as skin splits open to reveal rows of eclectic teeth lining cruel, lipless mouths. Each tooth differs wildly in shape and size from its neighbor, and sinewy ligaments emerging from these wounds act as tongues. These new mouths snap at anything nearby, while older mouths seal shut as the flesh knits itself back together. This constant shifting makes combat with chaos maws a harrowing endeavor, as an ever-changing array of jaws may erupt to devour unwary foes.

##### Chaos Maws Tactics
Chaos maws are straightforward in combat, targeting enemies with the lowest armor class or the largest foes they can find.

\columnbreak

#### Flame Spoolers
A truly perplexing demon, the flame spooler mocks natural conventions. It has a humanoid build with blue skin and an avian head. However, its arms are overly muscular and used for locomotion, while its short, thin legs dangle off the ground. At first glance, this demon may appear ungainly or even comical. Yet, it defies logic, propelling itself at incredible speeds with its oversized arms. Meanwhile, its small feet twist and weave the winds of magic into a ball of chaotic energy, which it hurls at enemies, exploding into demonic fire upon impact.

##### Flame Spoolers Tactics
Flame spoolers function as artillery, staying in the back lines and targeting the largest groups of enemies they can.



#### Warp Fish
Warp fish are ichthyic demons that "swim" through imperceptible magical currents. They possess a single large, luminous eye and a cluster of tentacles that sway as they move. Those caught in the warp fish’s gaze are compelled to stumble helplessly toward it. Once within range, the tentacles lash out, ensnaring the victim and inducing a torrent of grotesque mutations. The prey is ultimately compressed into a gelatinous stream of twisted flesh.

##### Warp Fish Tactics
Warp fish prioritize locking down targets, using their hypnotic gaze on backline enemies with low wisdom and grappling them once they draw close.

Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can't perceive it. It ignores all objects and effects that aren't on the Ethereal Plane, allowing it to move through such objects. |

|  3  | ***Architect of Change.*** Whenever the Flame Spooler chooses a point with its Flame Splash attack, any ground within a 10-foot radius of the point becomes warped until the end of the Flame Spooler's next turn. Non-demons of change treat the area as difficult terrain, and when a non-demon of change moves into or within the area, it takes 4 (1d8) force damage for every 5 feet it travels.|
