## The Infinite Library Ver.1 <br> (Player Level: 8-13)
The players delve into an endless demonic library, gathering as much arcane knowledge as possible before retreating.


### Choosing The Level Range
There are two difficulty levels for this library you can use: an **Easier** one for players in the **8-10 level range** and a **Harder** one for players in the **11-13 level range**. The difficulty you're using will determine which tables you use throughout this document.

### The Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players enter the demonic library in search of the knowledge and treasure known to lie within. The library exists in another plane of existence, and the players should be made aware that once they leave, they won't be able to come back. They can leave any time they find the portal again.



### Navigating The Library

The library's shifting nature prevents the players from navigating meaningfully and makes backtracking futile. When they move between rooms, the DM rolls to determine the next room. Players may choose to search each room or continue onward.

#### Random Encounters
Every 3 rooms, roll a 1d6. On a roll of 1, two random encounters are present in the room, determined using the demon encounter tables found in the Encounters section.

### Searching A Room
The process of searching a room takes approximately 10 minutes and involves the following steps:

#### Arcana Check
Each searching player makes an Intelligence (Arcana) check to find lore within the room. Combine the rolls of all the searching players to determine the amount of treasure (books, scrolls) found using the tables in the Treasure Tables section.

#### Madness Check
After making the search checks, each player who searched must make a Wisdom (Insight) check to resist drawing the attention of demons with their curiosity. Combine the rolls to determine how many demons are summoned using the Encounter Tables section. Summoned demons appear in unoccupied spaces chosen by the DM. 


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Room Effects
Some rooms have special features the players can interact with:

**Rooms 1-3:** Contain a portal allowing the players to leave the plane. (The players enter through one of these rooms.)

**Rooms 4-6:** None

**Rooms 7-9:** None

**Rooms 10-12:** None

**Rooms 13-15:** None

**Room 16:** The room is filled with deformed statues that appear to communicate with players who observe them. Any player who accepts the statues' aid while searching the room gains advantage on their their Intelligence (Arcana) checks but has disadvantage on their Wisdom (Insight) check. If any demons appear, the player also suffers a Mutation (Mutation Save DC 17)

**Room 17:** Contains scrolls of foresight. Players who search the room roll a d20, recording the result. At any point within the next 8 hours, they may replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature they can see with this foretold roll (chosen before making a roll), after which they can't use the roll again. 

**Room 18:** The room's table holds scrolls detailing secrets the players desire. Instead of making an Intelligence (Arcana) check, players may cast the *legend lore* spell or open a portal that allows them to leave the plane. They must then all make a Wisdom (Insight) check as though they all searched the room.

**Room 19:** Within the room, a pink and teal flame each whisper to the players. The teal flame offers protection from madness, granting players advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks while in the room if they place their hands within it. The pink flame promises arcane knowledge, granting players advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks if they place their hands in its flame. Players cannot benefit from both flames.

**Room 20:** An **exalted pink terror of change** frantically searches the library shelves. It informs the players that it will help them search the library and allow them to keep anything they find if they assist it in locating its tome. The terror will aid the players by making its own Intelligence (Arcana) and Wisdom (Insight) checks to find loot or summon demons. However, it will not assist in combat and remains indifferent to any fighting.

If any player rolls a natural 20 on their Arcana check, they will locate the tome. The terror will demand the book immediately, even if demons are attacking. If the players give it the book, it will teleport away. If they refuse, it will attack them without hesitation.

The book can be a rare tome the players can turn in for gp, or it could be a spellbook containing a random assortment of spell scrolls within.

### Treasure Tables
When the players make their checks to search a room, combine the totals and use the appropriate table below to determine how much treasure they find. 

The items they find can come in the form of tomes, gems, spell scrolls, or other arcane oddities. Treat the tomes and other arcane items as though they're art objects from the DMG's Treasure chapter for the purposes of assigning their value. If you're awarding spell scrolls, choose spells from the Wizard or Warlock spell lists and use the magic item section of the DMG to choose spells of the appropriate gp value.


##### Easier Library Treasure Table

| Combined Roll Result|  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  40 or Less | No Treasure |
|  41-50 | 50gp Worth of Items | 
|  51-60 | 75gp Worth of Items  |  
|  61-70 |  100gp Worth of Items |  
|  71 or More |  150gp Worth of Items |

|  71-80 |  1,000gp Worth of Items |  
|  81 or More |  1,500gp Worth of Items |  

### Encounter Tables
When the players make their checks their Wisdom (Insight) checks after searching a room, combine the totals and use the appropriate table below to determine how many demon mobs they attract. Use the demon mobs tables in The Demon Mobs section to randomly determine what demons will make up each mob and then combine the mobs to form the encounter the players will face.

##### Easier Library Encounter Table

| Combined Roll Result|  Number of Demon Mobs  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  50 or Less | 3 |
|  51-60 | 2 |

### The Demon Mobs
When the players are facing random mobs of demons, roll on the appropriate table below for each mob and then combine them to create the demonic encounter. This should ensure the players constantly face new types of demonic groupings and keep them on their toes.

##### Easier Demon Mob Table

|  2 | Blue Terror of Change x4|  
|  3 | Screecher of Change x1  |
|  4 | Exalted Pink Terror of Change x1 |
|  5 | Flamer of Change x1 | 
|  6 | Iridescent Terror of Change x1 |  

##### Harder Demon Mob Table
| 1d6  | Encounter Composition |

|  2 | Chromatic Terror of Change x4|  
|  3 | Thunderous Screecher of Change x1  |
|  4 | Blazing Pink Terror of Change x1 |
|  5 | Exalted Flamer of Change x1 | 
|  6 | Herald of Change x1 |  

### Demon Tactics
The following are tips on using different types of demons to their full potential in combat.

#### Terror of Change Tactics
Pink terrors should group together to maximize their Growing Flames trait, slowly advancing toward the enemy as they become wounded. When they split, the blue and brimstone terrors will move into melee range. Even unwounded pink terrors should move closer to keep benefitting from Growing Flames, as blue and brimstone terrors will still trigger this ability.

##### Chromatic and Prismatic Terrors
With high resistance to elemental damage and the Chromatic Spawning ability, chromatic and prismatic terrors will typically target non-spellcasters, who pose a greater threat.

##### Exalted Pink Terrors of Change
Exalted terrors can use the Arcane Mirth ability instead of attacking to empower a more powerful ally, such as an iridescent terror, or to reposition enemies away from advantageous spots.

\pagebreakNum


##### Blazing Terrors of Change
Blazing terrors can use both Conduit of Infinity and Greater Arcane Mirth to create devastating, high-accuracy attacks. If other blazing terrors or stronger demons are present, they will use these abilities to empower the stronger demon. Blazing terrors will only empower themselves if they have 40 or more hit points, as they likely won’t survive long enough to benefit otherwise.

##### Iridescent Terrors and Heralds of Change
These demons should be accompanied by other Demons of Change to benefit from their Locus ability. You can use the following guidelines when determining how to use their spells:

**Glean Magic:** Used immediately on the first full caster they see.

**Fireball/Fire Storm:** Cast if two targets with low Dexterity saves can be hit, or if three or more such targets can be hit (in which case this should be used before Glean Magic).

**Bolt of Change:** Targets creatures with low Charisma saving throws. The odds of hitting should be boosted by weaker minions (e.g., Blue or Brimstone Terrors) using the Help action or an Exalted Terror using Arcane Mirth.


##### *Locus of Change Abilities*
&emsp;**Locus of Abjuration.**  The terror and its minions within the locus should use hit-and-run tactics, attempting to make sure they do not take too much damage in one turn. 

**Locus of Evocation.** Does not greatly affect the terror's tactics

**Locus of Transmogrification.** This locus is most dangerous when paired with swarms of other demons. The brimstone terrors spawned from this ability can be used to boost the terror's Growing Flames ability.

#### Screecher of Change Tactics
Screechers will disengage if they can move past three or more targets. They will attack if they can avoid effective opportunity attacks, targeting creatures with high AC or large size.

##### Thunderous Screecher
Thunderous Screechers follow similar tactics but prioritize flying past melee fighters when disengaging. They may save their bite attack for creatures capable of making effective opportunity attacks. They will use *thunderwave* if it can hit three or more targets or help it avoid opportunity attacks.

### Flamers of Change Tactics

Flamers avoid stacking mutations on a single target and instead spread their attacks and spells across multiple enemies. They prioritize using Flame Blast on low-AC targets and cast spells when they can hit three or more targets or two with low Dexterity saves. Exalted Flamers only use *fireball* if they can hit one extra target, as it deals less damage than their other spells.

\columnbreak

### XP Award
For each room the players successfully searched, award them 5,000 XP for the easier version of the library and 7,000 XP for the harder version of the library. 


### Adventure Tie Ins
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The players take a portal between planes when they stumble into the Infinite Library. A demon greets them and tells them they can quickly leave through another portal or stay awhile and try to collect as much arcane lore as possible before completing their journey. |
|  2  | The players are sucked through a vortex that leaves them in the Infinite Library. Each portal the players find leads to a different random location, and the players will have to decide how long they want to risk staying and which portal they ultimately want to escape through.  |
|  3  | The players seek ways to defeat a powerful demon of change and infiltrate the demi-plane where he stores all his forbidden lore, hoping to gain insights into defeating him. The more treasure and lore they successfully acquire, the better the odds of them overcoming his lair's defenses.|
|  4  | The players break into the library searching for the forbidden knowledge needed to craft power items or learn new eldritch spells. The more they successfully loot from the library, the better able they are to create these new items or add new spells to their repertoire. tors are impressed with the players’ capabilities and offer to hire them to recover more treasures from dangerous desert ruins.|

### New Spells

#### Bolt of Change
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation (condition described at end of document).

#### Burning Hands
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 20-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 you may increases the cone's size is increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

\columnbreak

#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.



After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.


#### Scorching Stream
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 50
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

A line of roaring flame 50 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and you may increases line's length by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
