## The Infinite Library Ver.2 <br> (Player Level: 6-15)
The players delve into an endless demonic library, gathering as much arcane knowledge as possible before retreating.


### Choosing The Level Range
There are two difficulty levels for this library you can use: an **Easier** one for players in the **6-8 level range** and a **Harder** one for players in the **13-15 level range**. The difficulty you're using will determine which tables you use throughout this document.

### The Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players enter the demonic library in search of the knowledge and treasure known to lie within. The library exists in another plane of existence, and the players should be made aware that once they leave, they won't be able to come back. They can leave any time they find the portal again.

### Navigating The Library

The library's shifting nature prevents the players from navigating meaningfully and makes backtracking futile. When they move between rooms, the DM rolls to determine the next room. Players may choose to search each room or continue onward.

#### Random Encounters
Every 3 rooms, roll a 1d6. On a roll of 1, two random encounters are present in the room, determined using the demon encounter tables found in the Encounters section.

### Searching A Room
The process of searching a room takes approximately 10 minutes and involves the following steps:

#### Arcana Check
Each searching player makes an Intelligence (Arcana) check to find lore within the room. Combine the rolls of all the searching players to determine the amount of treasure (books, scrolls) found using the tables in the Treasure Tables section.

#### Madness Check
After making the search checks, each player who searched must make a Wisdom (Insight) check to resist drawing the attention of demons with their curiosity. Combine the rolls to determine how many demons are summoned using the Encounter Tables section. Summoned demons appear in unoccupied spaces chosen by the DM. 


\columnbreak

#### Demonic Enhancements
Some rooms in the dungeon will cause demons to gain additional enhancements. Each time the demons are enhanced, choose one enhancement from the enhancement tables for the Chaos Maw, Kindle Dancer, Flame Spooler, and Warp Fish. All demons retain their enhancements for the rest of the library unless removed by a special circumstance.


#### Room Effects
Some rooms have special features the players can interact with:

**Rooms 1-3:** Contain a portal allowing the players to leave the plane. (The players enter through one of these rooms.)

**Rooms 4-6:** None

**Rooms 7-9:** None

**Rooms 10-12:** None

**Rooms 13-15:** None

**Room 16:** The room contains statues of four demons: a Chaos Maw, Kindle Dancer, Flame Spooler, and Warp Fish. The middle statue, depicting a thin summoner, speaks to a randomly chosen player and demands they select one of their minions to receive the "gift of change." All demons throughout the library of the chosen type gain a enhancement. If the players refuse to pick a statue, the DM may decide which demon type gets the upgrade. The players may search the room as normal afterward.

**Room 17:** This room contains vast shrine to demonic metamorphosis. If the players search the room and score 60 or less (70 on hard mode), they unwittingly release power to the demons, granting each demon in the dungeon get a enhancement. If the players score 61 or higher (71 on hard mode), they may either remove enhancement from each demon in the dungeon or double their treasure outcome for the room (their choice).

**Room 18:** Three large books lie in the room. A small mischievous demon named Monty (use the **blue terror of change** stat block) informs the players that the books act as portals leading to chaotic realms. One book, when opened, will release a vast amount of treasure (250 gp or 1,250 gp on hard mode), while the other two will unleash great demonic evil into the library (2 random encounters and a enhancement for all demons throughout the library). When players choose a book but before they open it, Monty offers the players a chance to switch their chosen book after revealing one of the other remaining books that contains demons.

**Room 19:** A large blob of gold fills the room. Upon closer inspection, the shapes of books and bodies twist and contort together into horrifying forms, and the golden braziers burning with pink fire hold the secrets of transformation. The players learn that if they search the room, any treasure gained is tripled, but all demons in the library will gain an enhanced. 

**Room 20:** A vortex of books swirls in the center of the room. The players learn if they search the room and score 60 or higher (70 on hard mode), they must choose to either leave the plane using the vortex or destroy it. Destroying the vortex triples their treasure but grants all demons in the dungeon get enhanced.

### Treasure Tables
When the players make their checks to search a room, combine the totals and use the appropriate table below to determine how much treasure they find. 

The items they find can come in the form of tomes, gems, spell scrolls, or other arcane oddities. Treat the tomes and other arcane items as though they're art objects from the DMG's Treasure chapter for the purposes of assigning their value. If you're awarding spell scrolls, choose spells from the Wizard or Warlock spell lists and use the magic item section of the DMG to choose spells of the appropriate gp value.


##### Easier Library Treasure Table

| Combined Roll Result|  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  40 or Less | No Treasure |
|  41-50 | 50gp Worth of Items | 
|  51-60 | 75gp Worth of Items  |  
|  61-70 |  100gp Worth of Items |

### Encounter Tables
When the players make their checks their Wisdom (Insight) checks after searching a room, combine the totals and use the appropriate table below to determine how many demon mobs they attract. Use the demon mobs tables in The Demon Mobs section to randomly determine what demons will make up each mob and then combine the mobs to form the encounter the players will face.

### XP Award
For each room the players successfully searched, award them 5,000 XP for the easier version of the library and 7,000 XP for the harder version of the library.

### New Condition: Mutated
Many creatures throughout these encounters inflict the mutated condition. When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|

### Adventure Tie Ins
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **A Journey Interrupted.** The players take a portal between planes when they stumble into the Infinite Library. A demon greets them and tells them they can quickly leave through another portal or stay awhile and try to collect as much arcane lore as possible before completing their journey. |
|  2  | **Prisoners to Curiosity.** The players are sucked through a vortex that leaves them in the Infinite Library. Each portal the players find leads to a different random location, and the players will have to decide how long they want to risk staying and which portal they ultimately want to escape through.  |
|  3  | **Deadly Research.**  The players seek ways to defeat a powerful demon of change and infiltrate the demi-plane where he stores all his forbidden lore, hoping to gain insights into defeating him. The more treasure and lore they successfully acquire, the better the odds of them overcoming his lair's defenses.|
|  4  | **Eldritch Artifice.** The players break into the library searching for the forbidden knowledge needed to craft power items or learn new eldritch spells. The more they successfully loot from the library, the better able they are to create these new items or add new spells to their repertoire. tors are impressed with the players’ capabilities and offer to hire them to recover more treasures from dangerous desert ruins.|

### Library Denizens 
Below are descriptions and tactics relating to the various demons roaming the infinite library.

#### Kindle Dancers
Kindle dancers are erratic fiends, their bodies consisting of a fleshy orb with a single blue eye surrounded by a ring of fangs. Numerous wiry limbs protrude from their center, each ending in large hands with multi-jointed fingers that can contort in any direction. These fiends use their limbs to move unpredictably across the battlefield, confounding enemies as they pass. All the while, their fingers execute a bewildering array of gestures to summon magical warp fire. Any foe foolish enough to allow these flame-wreathed fingers to touch them will see their flesh twist and warp before their very eyes.

##### Kindle Dancers Tactics
Kindle Dancers act as demonic rogues, prioritizing targets they can afflict with their Warp Touch ability. They avoid ending their turns in melee combat with opponents.

#### Chaos Maws
Chaos Maws embody savage disorder. These demons appear as fleshy orbs supported by several arms and legs. The center of their bodies constantly shifts as skin splits open to reveal rows of eclectic teeth lining cruel, lipless mouths. Each tooth differs wildly in shape and size from its neighbor, and sinewy ligaments emerging from these wounds act as tongues. These new mouths snap at anything nearby, while older mouths seal shut as the flesh knits itself back together. This constant shifting makes combat with chaos maws a harrowing endeavor, as an ever-changing array of jaws may erupt to devour unwary foes.

##### Chaos Maws Tactics
Chaos maws are straightforward in combat, targeting enemies with the lowest armor class or the largest foes they can find.

\columnbreak

#### Flame Spoolers
A truly perplexing demon, the flame spooler mocks natural conventions. It has a humanoid build with blue skin and an avian head. However, its arms are overly muscular and used for locomotion, while its short, thin legs dangle off the ground. At first glance, this demon may appear ungainly or even comical. Yet, it defies logic, propelling itself at incredible speeds with its oversized arms. Meanwhile, its small feet twist and weave the winds of magic into a ball of chaotic energy, which it hurls at enemies, exploding into demonic fire upon impact.

##### Flame Spoolers Tactics
Flame spoolers function as artillery, staying in the back lines and targeting the largest groups of enemies they can.



#### Warp Fish
Warp fish are ichthyic demons that "swim" through imperceptible magical currents. They possess a single large, luminous eye and a cluster of tentacles that sway as they move. Those caught in the warp fish’s gaze are compelled to stumble helplessly toward it. Once within range, the tentacles lash out, ensnaring the victim and inducing a torrent of grotesque mutations. The prey is ultimately compressed into a gelatinous stream of twisted flesh.

##### Warp Fish Tactics
Warp fish prioritize locking down targets, using their hypnotic gaze on backline enemies with low wisdom and grappling them once they draw close.

Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, it suffers a mutation effect (Mutation Save DC 13) at the end of each of its turns.

##### Flame Spooler Mutations
| d3  | Mutation |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Mending Flames.*** Flame spooler automatically hits any demon of change that it makes a Flame Splash attack against. Additionally, the demon takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the amount of fire damage dealt.|
|  2  | ***Shared Mutations.***  Whenever a creature gains a mutation caused by the flame spooler's Flame Splash, each other creature within 10 feet of it covered in warp fire gains the same mutation.|
|  3  | ***Architect of Change.*** Whenever the Flame Spooler chooses a point with its Flame Splash attack, any ground within a 10-foot radius of the point becomes warped until the end of the Flame Spooler's next turn. Non-demons of change treat the area as difficult terrain, and when a non-demon of change moves into or within the area, it takes 4 (1d8) force damage for every 5 feet it travels.|
