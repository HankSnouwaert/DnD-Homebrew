## The Well of Eternity  <br> (Player Level: 20)
In this adventure, the players venture through an otherworldly demonic library to face an eldritch demon lord of change before The Well of Eternity.

### First Entering The Library
When the players first enter the library, they hear a voice echoing through their minds providing the following guidance: 

*"Seek the twin gazes that pierce time itself. One lies within the eye of a prince who looks back on designs and plots long forgotten. The other rests in the gilded skull of the dreamer who beholds schemes yet to come. Seize their sight and cast it down the throat of eternity. Unite the eyes with the void, and the Fateweaver shall reveal all to you."*

The Eye of The Past is held by a demon prince of change known as **Zahneed Echoshard**, and the Eye of The Future is held by a master of change known as **The Golden Master.** When defeated, they leave behind the respective Eye, while the rest of their bodies dissolve.

It is up to the players to find and defeat each of these fiends and bring their eyes to The Well of Eternity.

##### Encounter Map: Sanctum of Eternity

##### Dungeon Features
* <font color="Blue">**Blue Lines:** These represent walls made of magical stone, making them impervious to teleportation and inaccessible via the Ethereal Plane. </font>
* <font color="Teal">**Teal Areas:** These represent elevation changes. </font>
* <font color="df1bd9">**Pink Areas:** These areas are engulfed in burning warp fire. Any creature entering or starting its turn there (except demons of change) takes 21 (6d6) fire damage that ignores resistance. Additionally, they must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or suffer a random mutation. </font>
* <font color="dfaa1b">**Orange Areas:** These are bottomless pits. </font>
* <font color="df1bd9">**Pink Letters:** These denote portals linking two separate parts of the library. Portals with the same letter are connected. A creature can use an action to pass through a portal. However, demons of change can use a bonus action to do so. </font>
* <font color="Purple">**Purple Area:** This is The Well of Eternity. Any creature other than the Fateweaver that ends its turn within the well takes 10d10 psychic damage, ignoring immunity and resistance. </font>

<br>

### Resting
If the players take a short or long rest in the sanctum, you can use the following guidelines.

**Short Rest.**
If the players take a short rest in the sanctum, roll 2d12 after they finish. For each number rolled, if the corresponding encounter has not already been defeated by the players, those creatures become aware of the players' presence and move to their location to attack together.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;**Long Rest.**
If the players take a long rest, follow a procedure similar to the Short Rest. However, roll 3d12, and if an encounter has already been defeated, the creatures from that encounter immediately return to life and come through the portal at the start of the sanctum.

### Encounters
Groups of demons lurk throughout the library and will attack the players on sight. The dungeon map shows where these encounters are located, and the following list describes what demons make up each encounter.

**Encounter 1:** 3x Exalted Flamer of Change, 3x Blazing Pink Terror of Change

**Encounter 2:** 1x Soul Grinder of Change, 3x Blazing Pink Terror of Change

**Encounter 3:** 1x Master of Change, 2x Blazing Pink Terror of Change

**Encounter 4:** 3x Exalted Flamer of Change, 1x Herald of Change with Locus of Evocation

**Encounter 5:** 2x Thunderous Screecher, 1x Burning Chariot of Change (pulled by 2 Thunderous Screechers), 1x Herald of Change with Locus of Abjuration and Riders of Change

**Encounter 6:** 1x Zahneed Echoshard (holding the Eye of the Past), 2x Exalted Flamer of Change

**Encounter 7:** 1x Master of Change, 4x Sour Pink Terror of Change

**Encounter 8:** 1x Master of Change, 2x Thunderous Screecher

**Encounter 9:** 4x Blazing Pink Terror of Change, 1x Herald of Change with Locus of Transmogrification

**Encounter 10:** 4x Blazing Pink Terror of Change (each riding a Burning Disk), Riders of Change

**Encounter 11:** 2x Soul Grinder of Change

**Encounter 12:** 1x The Golden Griffin (holding the Eye of the Future)

**Encounter 13:** 1x The Fateweaver



### Loot
The players should be able to find 1 or 2 level 17+ treasure hoards spread throughout the labyrinth. This treasure can be distributed across many rooms, but a large portion should be stashed near The Well of Eternity to be collected after The Fatebinder is defeated. 

### Final Encounter
To initiate the final encounter, players must cast both Eyes into the Well of Eternity. Once this is done, the Fateweaver appears in any area within the room of its choice and immediately attacks.

### Adventure Tie Ins
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure or provide more context for why the players are here, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Well of Knowledge.** The players desperately need forbidden knowledge known only to the Fatebinder, and he will only provide them what they desire if they can bring him the eyes taken by his rivals, cast them into the well, and defeat him in combat.|
|  2  | **Defiler of Destiny.** The Fatebinder lurks deep within the well, tampering with the nature of reality. The players have been sent to draw him forth by casting the eyes into the well so they can put a stop to his manipulations.  |
|  3  | **A God Afraid.** A demon god of change has grown fearful of The Fatebinder and the knowledge he has gained from the well and has tasked the players with delving into his realm and destroying the demon. |
|  4  | **The Banishing of the Eyes.** The players previously banished Zahneed Echoshard and The Golden Master back to their demonic realm and have come to finish them off and destroy the Eyes they've been wielding by throwing them into the well. This inadvertently summons The Fatebinder, who seeks to punish them for destroying the artifacts he originally possessed.|

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.



\columnbreak

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.

## Kyros Fatebinder's Lair
Kyros Fatebinder is makes his lair in archives of eldridge knowledge and power. These temporary locations range from arcane libraries to grand observatories or long-forgotten crystalline fortresses. Wherever he settles, it doesn't take long for the intensity of Kyros Fatebinder's presence to twist his new surroundings, causing reality to fray.


##### Madness of Fateweaver
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |I obsess over future events, constantly trying to manipulate circumstances to achieve my desired outcomes. |
|  2  | I am infatuated with past events, needing to understand every painful detail of what happened. |
|  3  | I become overwhelmed by choices and their potential future consequences, often feeling paralyzed when it's time to make a decision. |
|  4  | I obsess over past events, replaying them over and over in my mind. |

#### Lair Actions
While in his lair, Kyros Fatebinder's challenge rating increases by 5.

When Kyros Fatebinder rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or Kyros Fatebinder dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 25 and can act on its own accord, always acting in Kyros Fatebinder's best interest. While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair casts one of the spells listed below. 

A spell cast this way ends on initiative count 20 of the next turn, and the lair can't cast the same spell again (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks) for the next hour.

* Bestial Spirit (6th level)
* Flame Cage
* Horrifying Laughter
* Net of Light
* Pit of Shadows
* Plague of Rust (6th level)
* Storm Sphere (6th level)
* Wall of Thorns

### Epic Fateweaver Battle
If you wish to make Kyros Fatebinder into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 804 hit points, and give him the Chaos Caster ability. This increases his CR to 28.

***Chaos Caster (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If Kyros Fatebinder is reduced to half his hit points (402) or less, he may end any effects incapacitating or preventing him from casting spells. Both heads may then immediately cast *chaos storm* without any components (no action required). Both heads are concentrating on the spell and can use their actions to open gates. The spell only ends once both heads have stopped concentrating on the spell.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Bolt of Change
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation (condition described at end of document).

\columnbreak

#### Burning Hands
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (20-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instant
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips.

- **Components:** V, S, M (A bar of lead)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

You speak a word of power that transforms a creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is petrified, turning to gold until the spell ends. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

**Ending The Effect.** A petrified target can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell, it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed* with the petrified creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

**Damaging A Petrified Creature.** If a petrified creature is physically damaged or broken during this state, it will manifest the same damage upon being reverted to its original form.

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

You choose a point on a solid surface within range, causing a cage made of opaque flames in the shape of a cube to appear. The cube can be up to 30 feet on each side, and it lasts for the duration. 

**Creatures Caught Partially Within the Cage.** When the cage is created, creatures only partially within the cube's area, or those too large to fit inside the area, must choose to be pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area or move into the cage if they can fit. 

**Creatures In The Cage When It Forms.** Any creature fully within the cage when it forms (including those that chose to move inside it) must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 7d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

A line of searing liquid silver up to 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. At the end of the line, the silver spreads out into a 30-foot cone emanating in the direction of the line. Each creature in the line or cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.

___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 and you may increases line's length by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |

|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|

|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
