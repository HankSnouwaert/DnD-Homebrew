## The Rage Hounds' Quarry  <br> (Player Level: 8-10 )
In this encounter, the players help protect a wounded priest from demonic rage hounds who have hunted him across a hellish landscape to a shrine where he is now attempting to ward them off.

### Encounter Context
The players find the priest hiding in a fiendish shrine in a demonic landscape (possibly on another plane of existence.) The priest tells them he was part of a group of soldiers sent to battle the demons. They were overwhelmed and he was the only survivor to escape. Since then, he has been pursued by demonic rage hounds who have nearly caught up to him. He now asks the players to help him make a stand against his pursuers in this shrine, as it was the only defensible structure he was able to find. To aid in his defense, the priest placed holy wards around the  entrances.

### Lead Up
Within about 30 seconds of hearing the priest's story, the hounds will arrive. They will attempt to approach the shrine stealthily and will be able to detect the barriers from a distance. Their heightened senses will also allow them to detect the number of inhabitants within the shrine along with their general positions. The hounds are smart enough to form a basic plan around how to break in and will not rush headlong into obvious traps or focus their attacks on an entrance that is heavily guarded.

### The Priest
The priest (stats of a **priest**) only has half his hit points when the players find him. He only has his 1st level spell slots left and will use them to cast *sanctuary* on himself and heal wounded players. 

### The Wards
The priest has placed lines of a holy powder along the entrances of the shrine, which prevent demons from crossing it or even attacking through the lines. However, the wards can be attacked by the demons, and each line has an AC 16 and 30 HP (the hounds cannot use Pack Tactics to get an advantage on their attacks against the wards.) A ward dropped to 0 HP is permanently destroyed.

### The Rage Hounds
Rage hounds are specifically designed to target backline spellcasters and will prioritize attacking the priest when able. Below are some tips for using them most effectively:
* If they can't reach a target concentrating on a spell, try to hit the said target with Burning Howl.
* Try to surround spellcasters with multiple rage hounds to prevent escape.

#### Blood Hunters

* Spell casters that deal high damage are still a major threat and should be the highest priority targets.
* Remember that Gore Feast can be triggered twice per round, once on the rage hound's turn and again when it makes an attack of opportunity or uses its Mage Slayer reaction.
* The extra damage potential from Gore Feast and Mage Slayer means these rage hounds will risk taking significant damage to reach enemy spell casters.

### Aftermath
The hounds will fight to the death and will relentlessly pursue anyone who flees. Their priority will be pursuing the priest if he flees, but if the players interfered with their hunt, they will become the next targets of the hounds' wrath. If the players successfully protect the priest, he will thank them and either offer to aid them in their journey or ask to be escorted back to safety.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be harvested from the demons' remains. If the players save the priest, he may express his gratitude by offering them 2d4(5) 250 gp art objects he found while investigating the shrine before they arrived. These could be ornate fiendish statuettes or other idols.

#### XP Award: 8,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the hounds and protecting the priest can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **100% XP:** The players defeat the hounds with the priest still alive.
* **50% XP:** Either the players retreat with the priest alive and the hounds still pursuing them, or the players defeat the hounds, but the priest is killed.
* **10% XP:** The priest dies, and the players flee the hounds.




### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. <br><br>

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-7).** Remove the Rage Hound Blood Hunter. Change the XP award to 5,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 12-14).** Replace the Rage Hounds with Rage Hound Blood Hunters and add an extra Blood Hunter (for a total of 5 Blood Hunters.) Change the XP award to 18,000 XP.



### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Corrupted Shrine:** After the battle, the players discover that the shrine, once a place of holy power, has been subtly corrupted by the demonic presence. The priest asks the players to help him purify it so that it may be a stronghold against the surrounding forces of evil.  |
|  2  | **The Houndmaster:** Behind the rage hounds is a powerful demon known as the Houndmaster who leads the army the priest's allies were defeated by. The players must ally with the priest and find a way to stop the Houndmaster's forces before they can carry out their conquest.  |
|  3  | **Hellscape Retreat:** Once the priest is secure, he asks the players to help escort him back through the demon-infested territory to his stronghold, where he can relay help his allies regroup.  |
|  4  | **Scattered Survivors:** The priest believes there may be other survivors from his ill-fated attack force that are scattered across the demonic landscape and asks the players to aid him in a search and rescue. |

###  Rage Hound Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

####  Rage Hound Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
