## The Brass Bridge  <br> (Player Level: 17-19)
In this encounter, the players must cross a demonic bridge into a citadel of brass while being assaulted by hordes of demons of rage on all sides.

### Encounter Context
This encounter likely takes place in an extraplanar demonic realm where the players are attempting to assault a fiendish citadel head-on. This makes for a good initial fight in a larger dungeon adventure where the players are traversing the citadel itself. Alternatively, you could flip the players' starting location and the locations of the first two waves of demons to turn this into an encounter where the players are attempting to escape the citadel. 

### Lead Up
There is little in the way of lead-up needed, as the encounter will start as soon as the players start crossing the bridge and reach the start location shown on the map.

### The Demon Waves
The waves of attacking demons mostly consist of bloodrenders and their juggernaut steeds before culminating with a warthirster. There are 3 waves of demons. The first wave enters at the start of the encounter, and each subsequent wave enters 2 rounds after the previous one on initiative count 1 and rolls for initiative for the next round of combat.

**Wave 1:** 4 **Exalted Bloodrenders** and 1 **Bloodreaver** who enter to face the players<br>
&emsp;**Wave 2:** 3 **Exalted Bloodrenders** with the Rage Rider ability riding in on **Juggernauts** from behind the players<br>
&emsp;**Wave 3:** 1 **Exalted Warthirster** who bursts forth from the fountain of blood

### Bloodrender Tactics
Bloodrenders are nimble melee shock troops. Below are some tips for using them most effectively:
* Keep them in groups to maximize the effectiveness of their Murderous Tide ability. 
* They are fragile, so strike hard and fast. 
* They have high attack bonuses, so you can use them to bring down tanky targets with high AC.

#### Exalted & Hellforged Bloodrenders
* Try to trigger Hungering Blade by attacking whoever is the closest to 0 hit points.
* Have the bloodthirsters work together to trigger Hungering Blade with their Merciless Tide ability.

<br>

#### Bloodreavers & Heralds of Rage
These bloodrenders serve as commanders and should take up central positions among other demons of rage to make the most use of Merciless Tide. They have two new abilities to consider:

**Bloodmark:** This ability should be activated when two or more demons have engaged in melee combat with an opponent. Don't use it early; otherwise, the marked enemy will have the chance to retreat.

**Revel In Slaughter:** Use this ability early in the fight once most of the bloodrender's allies are within attack range. Don't save this for everyone to get hit by debilitating effects, as that is too hard to predict. 

#### Rage Riders
Bloodrenders typically ride juggernauts, which can knock their prey prone. As such, the juggernaut should attack first so the bloodrender can gain advantage against the prone target. Additionally, remember that the juggernaut is a demon of rage, allowing it to contribute to the Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide abilities.

### Warthirster Tactics
Warthirsters excel as melee brutes and possess formidable resistance to magic thanks to their Magic Resistance and Spell Breaker traits. Their ability to fly, coupled with their aggressive nature, allows them to easily reach their desired targets. Although they can fly, warthirsters usually prefer ground combat so that they can make use of their Land Rebels trait.

#### Warthirster Reactions
Warthirsters have two available reactions:

**Vengeful Strike:** This reaction is generally the preferred choice for warthirsters as it carries less risk.

**Wrathful Counter:** Blood thirstiers opt for this reaction when they have received disadvantage on attack rolls, are unable to move, or have strong reason to believe an enemy spellcaster is about to cast a 6th-level or higher spell. Note that the blood thirstiers lack advanced knowledge of the specific spell being cast, and it's up to the Dungeon Master to determine whether this reaction is used at the start of the player's turn. (NOTE: I'm not sure what this last sentence means.)

#### Exalted Warthirsters
The primary difference with exalted warthirsters is that they possess legendary actions, with their two primary legendary actions used as follows:

**Hellfire Breath:** The exalted warthirster uses this action whenever it can hit three or more opponents at once.

**Head Bash:** This action is used when there aren't enough targets for Hellfire Breath or when there's an opponent causing a significant amount of trouble for the warthirster. A strategic combination is for the warthirster to use Vengeful Strike to close the distance to the desired target and then utilize Head Bash on the same turn.

#### The Bloody Fist (Harder Encounter)
The Bloody Fist's most unique trait is its ability to inflict bloody wounds on its targets, which is complimented by its Goreshell reaction. Its main goal is to whittle down foes with wounds while sustaining itself with Goreshell. 

The following tactics can maximize The Bloody Fist's effectiveness:

**Stacking Wounds.** Stack as many wounds on a single target as possible.

**Enemy Healers.** Prioratize taking down anyone capable of casting healing spells at 5th-level or higher.

**Serrated Whip.** This can pull enemies across the blood spikes, causing a massive number of wounds on a target. The Bloody Fist should take any opportunity to use this combo, even if the pulled creature isn't its primary target.

**Switching Targets.** If the Bloody Fist's primary target becomes heavily protected by its allies, who expend significant resources to prevent further wounds, it should switch targets. The Bloody Fist will start inflicting wounds on a new foe, aiming to divert the party's attention.

**Hemorrhaging Roar.** This should be used if it can hit a group of targets who have a total of 9 wounds among them.

### Aftermath
The encounter will only end when all the participants of one side have been slain, or the players have fled. The demons will fight to the death and relentlessly pursue the players if they flee. 

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be harvested from the demons' remains. Because the goal of this encounter is to cross the bridge in one piece, there likely won't be much opportunity to provide additional immediate treasure. However, you could have the players stumble upon an armory with valuables soon after this encounter, which could contain a treasure hoard's worth of goods.

#### XP Award: 35,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the wolverine can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the demons and cross the bridge without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players cross the bridge but don't defeat all the demons, or they end up taking heavy damage during the fight.
* **50% XP:** The players defeat all the bloodrenders or the warthirster, but they retreat back the way they came rather than cross the bridge. 
* **10% XP:** The players retreat back the way they came rather than cross the bridge without defeating all the bloodrenders or the warthirster.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. <br><br>

**Easier Encounter (Level 15-17).** Use the following demon waves, and change the XP award to 00 XP.

**Wave 1:** 4 **Bloodrenders** and 1 **Bloodreaver** who enter to face the players<br>
&emsp;**Wave 2:** 3 **Bloodrenders** with the Rage Rider ability riding in on **Juggernauts** from behind the players<br>
&emsp;**Wave 3:** 1 **Warthirster** who bursts forth from the fountain of blood <br><br>


**Harder Encounter (Level 20+).** Use the following demon waves, and change the XP award to 00 XP.

**Wave 1:** 4 **Hellforged Bloodrenders** and 1 **Herald of Rage** who enter to face the players<br>
&emsp;**Wave 2:** 3 **Hellforged Bloodrenders** with the Rage Rider ability riding in on **Searing Juggernauts** from behind the players<br>
&emsp;**Wave 3:** **The Bloody Fist** who bursts forth from the fountain of blood

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**War God's Gauntlet:** This encounter is part of a gauntlet of enemies players have to battle through, fighting their way through the brass citadel until they make it to the final challenge to prove their worth before a war god. |
|  2  | **The Brass Siege:** The citadel is under siege by another army, and the players are using the distraction to break in and bring down its demonic defenses from within.|
|  3  | **Escape From The Brass Citadel:** The players somehow accidentally teleported into the citadel or stumbled there via a portal and are now trying to escape it via the bridge.   |
|  4  | **Rage Gate:** The bridge is actually on the Material Plane near planar gates that allow demons to cross over. The players must cross the bridge to reach and close the gate before more demonic hordes can cross through.  |

### Demon Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
