## The Exiled One's Lair <br> (Player Level: 20)
In this encounter, the players must face off against the bloodthirsty demon lord known as The Exiled One in his fiendish lair where he collects the skulls of his many slain enemies.

### Encounter Context
This encounter has the potential to be the final battle of an adventure, if not an entire campaign. The Adventure Followups table on the next page has ideas for how to fit it into a larger adventure. However this encounter is brought into your adventures, it shouldn’t be taken lightly, and the players should have some idea of what they’re up against rather than stumbling blindly to their deaths. 

### Lead Up
How the players find this cavernous chamber will depend on the context of the encounter. They should know what awaits them inside, though there will be no other way to enter except through the main entrance, at which point, The Exiled One will be aware of their presence. 

### Map Description
* **Chains.** The chains throughout the lair can be crossed by creatures with a climb speed or who pass a DC 15 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check when they first step onto them. Creatures who fail the check fall prone on the chains, and those who fail by 5 or more fall through the chains to the ground below. Each group of chains has an AC 19, 30 HP, and immunity to fire, psychic, and poison damage. Reducing the group to 0 HP destroys all the chains in that area.
* **Lava.** A creature takes 22 (5d8) fire damage when it enters lava for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

### Running the Encounter
The Exiled One is a melee brute and possesses formidable resistance to magic thanks to his Magic Resistance and Spell Breaker traits. The Exiled One's primary mechanic revolves around the levels of fury he gains through a fight from his Fury Incarnate trait. 

Below are some tips to keep in mind during the fight:

* The Exiled One's primary objective is to engage the opponents dealing the most damage to him, as he seeks to prolong the conflict as much as possible to gain more fury.

* Use Bellow of Fury whenever it can strike three or more targets or if he is unable to reach any opponents.

 * **Vengeful Strike:** This is generally the preferred reaction choice for The Exiled One as it carries less risk.

<br>

* **Wrathful Counter:** The Exiled One opts for this reaction when he has received a disadvantage on attack rolls, is unable to move, or has strong reason to believe an enemy spellcaster is about to cast a 6th-level or higher spell. Note that The Exiled One lacks advanced knowledge of the specific spell being cast, and it's up to the Dungeon Master to determine whether this reaction is used at the start of the player's turn. (NOTE: I'm not sure what this last sentence means.)


### Aftermath
The Exiled One will fight to the bloody end. If the players flee, he will pursue them for as long as possible, potentially leading to a chase sequence. 

If the players defeat The Exiled One, award them 135,000 XP.

#### Loot
You can use the loot table found later in this document to determine what valuables The Exiled One might leave behind. Considering this encounter is likely to be a major boss battle, it may be fitting to reward the players with a magic item or loot from one or even two treasure hoards of Callange 17+, as described in the DMG. This treasure might be what the players plunder from the chamber or something that was carried by The Exiled One.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 17-19).** Remove The Exiled One's lair actions. Change the XP Award to 62,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (5 Level 20 Players).** Double The Exiled One's hit points (bringing them up to 840). Change the XP award to 250,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Last Stand.** This lair was hidden away in a dangerous corner of The Exiled One's home plane, and slaying him here ended his threat once and for all.|
|  2  |**A Momentary Reprive.** This lair was only a temporary abode in the Material Plane during his latest rampage, and slaying him here banished him back to the realm of demons. It is now up to the players to follow him there and finish the job. |
|  3  | **The New Champions.** As knowledge of the victory over The Exiled One spreads, other demons of rage soon pursue them, eager to test their metal against the players. |
|  4  | **The Balance of Power.** The Exiled One's defeat leads to a power imbalance that threats to allow rival demon factions to grow in power. The players must quickly put an end to these other demon lords before their influence can grow.|

### Lair Actions

When The Exiled One rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or The Exiled One dies, the lair has an Intelligence 8 and can act of its own accord but always acts in The Exiled One's best interest. While active this way, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

**Axe of Wrath.** A brass axe slices through reality at a point within the lair and flies in a straight line in a direction the lair chooses before disappearing after it moves 100 feet or strikes a solid surface. If the axe would strike a creature, that creature must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the axe strikes the target and disappears. Anything struck by the axe takes 45 (10d8) slashing damage.

**Fiery Cave In.** The lair chooses a point on the cave ceiling, which begins to glow with firey heat. On initiative count 20 of the next round, a 10-foot-radius burning rock falls from that point of the ceiling. The rock passes through any Large or smaller creatures and objects, halting upon contact with a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. Any creature or object that comes into contact with the rock must make a Dexterity saving throw., taking 22 (5d8) fire damage and 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. The area where the rock lands becomes difficult terrain until initiative count 20 of the following round. Creatures ending their turn in this area take 22 (5d8) fire damage.

**Binding Chain.** The lair manifests a chain that emerges from the ground in an unoccupied space on a solid surface of its choice within itself. The chain targets a creature selected by the lair within 100 feet of where it emerged. The targeted creature must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the creature's choice) or be pulled toward the chain and restrained by it for 1 minute. Creatures immune to the grappled condition are unaffected by this effect.

While restrained by the chain, a creature cannot move more than 10 feet away from the chain's origin point and is unable to teleport or travel between planes. The creature can use its action to attempt a DC 19 Strength check, ending the restraint on a success.

The chain has an Armor Class (AC) of 19, 30 hit points, and immunity to fire, psychic, and poison damage. If the chain is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and the creature is no longer restrained.

### New Condition: Berserk
Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
 * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
 * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.

>
> **Bellow of Endless Fury (Costs 3 Actions).** The Exiled One lets out a roar that burns the air in a 120-foot cone in front of him, ignoring cover and magical barriers. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 6 (1d12) fire damage plus 6 (1d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save is failed by 10 or more, the creature is also stunned until the end of the creature's next turn. Both the fire and thunder damage increase by 6 (1d12) for each level of fury The Exiled One has.

### Exiled One Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.




#### The Exiled One Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
