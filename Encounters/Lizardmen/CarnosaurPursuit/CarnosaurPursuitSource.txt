## Carnosaur Pursuit <br> (Player Level: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players are attempting to escape a deadly carnosaur who pursues them as they race a horse-drawn cart through a hazardous jungle.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players are traveling through a primordial jungle filled with dinosaurs and other hazards. The encounter features a wounded explorer with a horse-drawn cart used to make the getaway. The explorer may be an NPC the players have already met or one they're meeting for the first time. In either case, the players should have good reason to take his instructions to flee seriously, and when they see the carnosaur emerge from the jungle, it should be apparent that it is too much for them to handle.

### Lead Up
The encounter begins with the players either seeking out the explorer to meet with him or happening to stumble upon him in the jungle. Whatever the case, they will find him fleeing for his life from the carnosaur known as Guldbloom's Terror. The explorer only has roughly half his hit points, is suffering from a level of exhaustion, and has a carnosaur wound (described in the Bite attack of Guldbloom's Terror.) He will shout at the players to get in the cart quickly and ask one of them to drive, as he is too exhausted to do so competently. Shortly after the players situate themselves in the cart, Guldbloom's Terror will emerge into view 75 feet away from them. 


### Environment Description
The map for this encounter represents a possible section of the jungle where combat could take place. If this happens because the cart is destroyed, you can use the map variant with the destroyed cart present.
* **Lighting.** It should be daytime for this encounter, leading the environment to be well-lit.
* **Foliage.** The plants throughout the jungle can lightly or heavily obscure creatures, depending on how dense they are. They also create rough terrain.



### The Chase
This encounter utilizes the rules for Chases described starting on page 252 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The chase ends under any of the following conditions:

* The players ever get 250 or more feet away from Guldbloom's Terror
* The cart is destroyed
* Guldbloom's Terror gets within melee range of a player not in the cart
* The players reach the ceradon described in The Ceradon section later in the document

#### The Cart & Horses
The cart is drawn by 2 warhorses that can only take the Dash action on each of their turns. The horses don't roll for initiative, but instead, both act in unison on initiative count 20. Stats for the cart can be found under the Encounter Reference Material later in this document.

#### Guldbloom's Terror
The following considerations and rules modifications should be used for Guldbloom's Terror during this chase:

* Guldbloom's Terror doesn't roll for intuitive but acts on intuitive 1.
* Guldbloom's Terror should not have access to any of its legendary actions except Tenacious Will during the chase. If the chase ends and traditional combat begins, it gains access to all its legendary actions as usual.
* Guldbloom's Terror can use its Frightful Presence when taking the Dash action during the chase (which will give it disadvantage on Constitution checks made as a result of dashing.)
* Blood Tracking will allow Guldbloom's Terror to move an extra 25 feet if any of the players in the cart (including the explorer who was wounded at the start of the chase) have a carnosaur wound.
* If Guldbloom's Terror reaches the cart, it rips a piece off the cart. If it rips three or more pieces off the cart this way, the cart is destroyed, and the chase ends.

#### Chase Complications
Instead of rolling for complications for each player, roll once at the start of the horses' turn and have the complication happen immediately. Use the following table to determine the complication:


##### Carnosaur Pursuit Chase Complications
| d20  | Complication |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Brush:** The cart travels through thick brush. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the brush becomes 10 feet of difficult terrain for the cart.|
|  2  | **Uneven Ground:** The cart encounters rough terrain. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the terrain becomes 20 feet of difficult terrain for the cart. |
|  3  | **Sharp Turn:** The cart must make an abrupt turn. All passengers must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be thrown over the cart's side, rendering their hands unusable as they hang from the edge. They or another creature in the cart can make a DC 15 Strength check to pull them back in. A creature in the cart has advantage on this check. Failing a save or check by 5 or more results in the creature falling prone beside the cart.   |
|  4  | **Low Hanging Branches:** The cart moves through an area with particularly low tree branches. Each creature in the cart must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being hit by a branch and knocked out of the cart. On a failed save, a creature is knocked over the cart's side, as described in the Sharp Turn complication (result 3). If they fail a save or check by 5 or more, they fall prone beside the cart.
|  5  | **Snake Statue:** The cart passes by a mysterious snake statue that emits a mesmerizing aura. Passengers must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or stumble over the side of the cart as described in the Sharp Turn complication (result 3). If they fail a save or check by 5 or more, they fall prone beside the cart.
|  6  | **Venomous Swarm:** The cart speeds past foliage containing swarms of venomous creatures. Each passenger is targeted by a melee weapon attack (+5 to hit) from these angered animals. On a hit, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. |
|  7  | **Spore Cloud:** The cart runs over mushroom clusters, which release blinding spores. The horses and passengers must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. While blinded this way, their speed is halved.|
|  8  | **Razor-Sharp Bramble:** The cart moves through sharp brambles. The horses and passengers must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or receive a Carnosaur Wound.|

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


|   | |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  9  | **Tangled Roots:** Thick roots obstruct the cart's path. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the cart's wheels become tangled with roots, cutting its speed in half until they are removed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free the roots from the cart. |
|  10  | **Fallen Log:** A massive log blocks the way. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the log becomes 20 feet of difficult terrain and damages the cart as if Guldbloom's Terror tore a piece off it. |
|  11  | **Dinosaur Stampede:** A herd of frightened dinosaurs crosses the cart's path. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the cart is damaged as if it has a piece torn out by Guldbloom's Terror.  |
|  12  | **Blood Suckers:** Swarms of bloodthirsty insects attack. Each passenger and the horses are targeted by a melee weapon attack (+5 to hit). On a hit, the target receives a Carnosaur Wound. |
|  13  | **Muddy Ground:** The cart enters a muddy area. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Wehicle) check or the mud becomes 30 feet of difficult terrain for the cart.|
|  14  | **Shrine of the Beast God:** The cart passes a shrine dedicated to an ancient beast god that hums with power and seems to be visibly invigorating Guldbloom's Terror. The shrine has 40 hit points and an AC of 15. If not destroyed within one round, it boosts the speed of Guldbloom's Terror by 10 feet for an hour.  |
|  15-20 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  | No complication |

<br>

#### The Ceradon
If the chase lasts for 5 rounds, on the 5th round, instead of rolling for a complication, the cart passes by a ceradon, which is provoked into attacking Guldbloom's Terror. The players can chose to stop and fight Guldbloom's Terror while it is being attacked by the ceradon, or they can flee while they have this opportunity.

\pagebreakNum

### Aftermath
The aftermath of this encounter will depend on how the chase ends:

* **The Players Get 250 Ft. or More Away From Guldbloom's Terror:**<br>
At this point, the players have gotten far enough away from the carnosaur that they can make their escape unimpeded.

* **The Cart is Destroyed**<br>
If the carnosaur disables the cart, Guldbloom's Terror will prioritize devouring the explorer and the cart's horses before turning to the players unless any of the players go out of their way to aggravate it and get its attention. This distraction can give the players the chance to flee into the dense jungle and attempt to hide if a direct fight is too much for them to handle.<br> Otherwise, if they've managed to damage the carnosaur enough over the course of the chase, they may attempt to stand their ground and finish it off. If you run a combat encounter in this scenario, use the encounter map with the broken wagon.

* **Guldbloom's Terror Gets Within Melee Range of a Player Not in The Cart** <br>
In this scenario, Guldbloom's Terror is able to initiate combat against a player who has no easy means of fleeing. If the players don't quickly find a way to slip away back into a chase, you will likely need to begin combat. You can use the version of the encounter map without a broken wagon for this.

* **The Players Reach the Ceradon:**<br> In this scenario, a ceradon attacks Guldbloom's Terror, allowing the players to make their getaway. Alternatively, they can choose to assist the ceradon in attempting to kill Guldbloom's Terror. You can use the version of the encounter map without a broken wagon to run combat for this.<br>As long as the players keep their distance from the ceradon and don't provoke it, it will not bother attacking them and be content with killing and eating the carnosaur. 

#### Loot
If you wish to provide a significant loot reward for this encounter, you can have the explorer (or his next of kin) award the players with approximately 1000 gp worth of treasure he looted during his jungle explorations. This treasure can come in the form of gold pieces or gems and art objects. If this was the final encounter of a larger adventure, you could award an entire treasure hoard.

If the players manage to slay Guldbloom's Terror, they may also be able to harvest its body using the loot tables described in the Encounter Reference Material. However, if they slay the carnosaur with the aid of the ceradon, the ceradon will claim the body for itself and attempt to drive off anyone trying to harvest it.

\columnbreak

#### XP Award: 14,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in escaping or defeating Guldbloom's Terror can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players slay Guldbloom's Terror and are able to harvest its body for loot.
* **100% XP:** The players escape Guldbloom's Terror or slay it with the aid of the cer0don, but the cerodon drives them off.
* **50% XP:** The players escape Guldbloom's Terror but the cart is destroyed or the explorer is killed.
* **10% XP:** The players lose the cart and are now fleeing for their lives through the jungle on foot.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If you're playing with a group of significantly lower-level players, you can use the easier variant of this encounter described below:

**Easier Encounter (Level 6-8).** Replace Guldbloom's Terror with a normal carnosaur with Blessing of the Hunter God (described in the Blessings of the Old Ones section later in this document) and change the DCs for chase complications to 14. <Br> Change the XP Award to 6,000 XP.




### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Explorer's Secrets:** The wounded explorer, in gratitude or in desperation, shares a secret map with the players. This map leads to an ancient temple hidden deep within the jungle. Guldbloom's Terror was guarding the entrance to this sacred site, and now, with the beast out of the picture or at least distracted, the players have a chance to uncover its secrets.|
|  2  | **The Resurrection Ritual:** Word spreads of Guldbloom's Terror's confrontation with the players. A faction seeking to harness the creature's power attempts to resurrect it using dark magic. The players must stop the ritual or, if too late, deal with a now undead or magically enhanced version of Guldbloom's Terror. |
|  3  | **Guldbloom's Lair:** The players stumble upon the lair of Guldbloom's Terror, a complex of caverns filled with treasure, traps, and remnants of the creature's past kills. However, other predators have started to move in, and some of the treasures may have owners who want them back.  |
|  4  | **Memories of The Hunted:** The explorer died during the escape, and now his spirit begins to visit one of the players in dreams, sharing fragmented memories of something significant he discovered before being chased. These clues lead to a hidden jungle wonder, but piecing the memories together and finding the location proves challenging.|

> ***Trample.*** The ceradon moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this move, it can attempt to enter Large or smaller creatures' spaces if it has moved at least 10 ft in a straight line beforehand. A creature whose space the ceradon would enter must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice). On a failed save, the creature falls prone and takes 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the ceradon moves into its space. <br>On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage, is not knocked prone, and is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of the ceradon's path. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the ceradon's movement ends.<br> If the ceradon remains in a prone creature's space, the creature is also restrained until it's no longer in the same space as the ceradon. While a creature is restrained in this way, it, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 19 Strength check. On a success, the creature is pulled to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of the ceradon and is no longer restrained.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Armored Crest.*** When an attacker the ceradon can see makes an attack roll against the ceradon or a creature within 5 feet of it, the ceradon can impose disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Blessings of the Old Ones

Some lizardmen and dinosaurs are created with enhanced abilities attributed to their ancient gods. These creatures bear colorations that signify their specialized abilities and the unique ways they can serve their masters. You can apply one of these blessings to any of the creature stat blocks described in this document. Doing so increases that creature’s CR by 1. 



#### Blessing of the Blood God

*These hyper-aggressive lizardmen are marked with blood-red scales and infused with a ferocity that drives them to slaughter in their god’s name.*

While the creature is rampaging, its has advantage on attack rolls and deals additional 11 (2d10) damage on hit.

#### Blessing of the God of Fate

*These lizardmen are marked by the oldest of gods with pure white scales and are said to be destined for greatness as fate itself bends to their will.*

At the start of creature’s turns, it can choose to be under the effects of the *foresight* spell until the end of its next turn.

Once the creature uses this feature, it can't use it again until it finishes a long rest.

#### Blessing of the Hunter God

Additionally, the creature has advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival) checks and can make them as a bonus action. 

Finally, the creature can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them.

## Tactics & Loot

### Carnosaur Tactics


Carnosaurs are apex predators, unafraid of any other creature. At the slightest hint of movement, they charge, using their claws to wound their target, followed by a powerful biting attack that sends them into a rampage. They use their tail attack to hit a secondary threat, but always prioritize hitting their primary prey with claw and bite attacks.

Despite their straightforward rampaging tendencies, carnosaurs have some tactical options. Their Blood Tracking ability allows them to pursue the most wounded prey in the area, bypassing the limitations of their rampaging condition. This is especially useful if the wounded target tries to flee. However, outside of this tactic, they still adhere to the standard rampage rules.

The carnosaur's innate lust for blood drives it to attack the most injured target with claw and bite attacks. If that creature manages to heal its wounds, the carnosaur promptly shifts its attention to the next nearest prey.

When lizardmen use carnosaurs as mounts, they shouldn't be treated as fully under the control of their rider unless that rider possesses the 'Blessing of the Beast God' from the lizardmen Blessings of the Old Ones list. A rider without this blessing is limited to guiding the carnosaur toward the most prominent target on the battlefield to unleash its wounding attacks. However, once the carnosaur begins to rampage, the rider loses all control, and the creature behaves as if it were wild.


#### Guldbloom's Terror 

Guldbloom's Terror exhibits unparalleled cunning compared to other carnosaurs. With its ambush ability and the Jungle Stalker trait, it patiently waits for the perfect moment to strike an unsuspecting target, often choosing the largest prey. Despite its sly nature, this creature is fearless and prioritizes kills that offer the most sustenance.
Guldbloom's Terror employs the same tactics as a standard carnosaur but doesn't risk entering into a rampage. It focuses on the most injured target it can detect, tearing it apart with cold precision rather than reckless rampaging.

\columnbreak

This carnosaur also possesses legendary actions used in specific situations:

**Blood Tracking and Tenacious Will:** These are employed whenever something prevents the carnosaur from attacking a severely wounded target.

**Claw:** The carnosaur uses this attack when it's adjacent to the most injured prey or if it aims to start wounding a new creature.
Bloody Roar: This ability is used when the carnosaur can affect four or more targets with it or if it can impact at least two targets that are either concentrating on spells or flying beyond its reach. Possessing a natural instinct for magic detection, if Guldbloom's Terror senses a spell of seventh level or higher being concentrated upon, it will seek to disrupt it this way.



### Ceradon Tactics

Ceradons are territorial, highly aggressive, and omnivorous creatures. While they don't actively hunt prey, they will readily attack anything within charging distance. In battle, a ceradon is resolute and acts primarily on instinct. It focuses on adversaries it perceives as the greatest threat, often choosing targets dealing significant damage or those of considerable size. However, it lacks the intelligence to realize the potential benefits of trampling multiple targets for increased damage output.

If a ceradon starts an encounter already in melee combat, it will retreat, even if doing so exposes itself to opportunity attacks. To defend against such attacks, it employs its Armored Crest reaction. Following the retreat, it starts charging foes with its Trample action. The ceradon will follow this up with its Gore attack. While it can't gore a target right beneath it, it can trample over a target before circling back to Gore, often doing so with an advantage. Once an opponent is impaled on its horns, the ceradon shifts focus to trampling nearby threats. If it pins another creature under its feet, it will continue its stomp attacks while standing atop the pinned foe.

### Carnosaur Loot
The valuable items looted from carnosaur will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a carnosaur. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Carnosaur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
