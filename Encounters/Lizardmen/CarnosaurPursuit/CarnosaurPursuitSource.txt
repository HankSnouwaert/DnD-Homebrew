## Carnosaur Pursuit <br> (Player Level: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players are attempting to escape a deadly carnosaur who pursues them as they race a horse-drawn cart through a hazardous jungle.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players are traveling through a primordial jungle filled with dinosaurs and other hazards. The encounter features a wounded explorer with a horse-drawn cart used to make the getaway. The explorer may be an NPC the players have already met or one they're meeting for the first time. In either case, the players should have good reason to take his instructions to flee seriously, and when they see the carnosaur emerge from the jungle, it should be apparent that it is too much for them to handle.

### Lead Up
The encounter begins with the players either seeking out the explorer to meet with him or happening to stumble upon him in the jungle. Whatever the case, they will find him fleeing for his life from the carnosaur known as Guldbloom's Terror. The explorer only has roughly half his hit points, is suffering from a level of exhaustion, and has a carnosaur wound (described in the Bite attack of Guldbloom's Terror.) He will shout at the players to get in the cart quickly and ask one of them to drive, as he is too exhausted to do so competently. Shortly after the players situate themselves in the cart, Guldbloom's Terror will emerge into view 75 feet away from them. 


### Environment Description
The map for this encounter represents a possible section of the jungle where combat could take place. If this happens because the cart is destroyed, you can use the map variant with the destroyed cart present.
* **Lighting.** It should be daytime for this encounter, leading the environment to be well-lit.
* **Foliage.** The plants throughout the jungle can lightly or heavily obscure creatures, depending on how dense they are. They also create rough terrain.



### The Chase
This encounter utilizes the rules for Chases described starting on page 252 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The chase ends under any of the following conditions:

* The players ever get 250 or more feet away from Guldbloom's Terror
* The cart is destroyed
* Guldbloom's Terror gets within melee range of a player not in the cart and is able to make an attack against that player on its turn
* The players reach the ceradon described in The Ceradon section later in the document

* <font color="DD941C">**Orange:** Damaged & Climbable Walls</font>
* <font color="FF33F9">**Pink:** Foliage (Light Obscurement)</font>




#### The Cart & Horses
The cart is drawn by 2 warhorses that can only take the Dash action on each of their turns. The horses don't roll for initiative, but instead, both act in unison on initiative count 20. Stats for the cart can be found under the Encounter Reference Material later in this document.

#### Guldbloom's Terror
The following considerations and rules modifications should be used for Guldbloom's Terror during this chase:

* Guldbloom's Terror doesn't roll for intuitive but acts on intuitive 1.
* Guldbloom's Terror should not have access to any of its legendary actions except Tenacious Will during the chase. If the chase ends and traditional combat begins, it gains access to all its legendary actions as usual.
* Guldbloom's Terror can use its Frightful Presence when taking the Dash action during the chase (which will give it disadvantage on Constitution checks made as a result of dashing.)

\pagebreakNum

* Blood Tracking will allow Guldbloom's Terror to move an extra 25 feet if any of the players in the cart (including the explorer who was wounded at the start of the chase) have a carnosaur wound.
* If Guldbloom's Terror reaches the cart during its turn and is able to take an action, it rips a piece off the cart. If it rips three or more pieces off the cart, the cart is destroyed, and the chase ends.

#### Chase Complications
Instead of rolling for complications for each player, roll once at the start of the horses' turn and have the complication happen immediately. Use the following table to determine the complication:


##### Carnosaur Pursuit Chase Complications
| d20  | Complication |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Brush:** The cart travels through thick brush. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the brush becomes 10 feet of difficult terrain for the cart.|
|  2  | **Uneven Ground:** The cart encounters rough terrain. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the terrain becomes 20 feet of difficult terrain for the cart. |
|  3  | **Sharp Turn:** The cart must make an abrupt turn. All passengers must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be thrown over the cart's side, rendering their hands unusable as they hang from the edge. They or another creature in the cart can make a DC 15 Strength check to pull them back in. A creature in the cart has advantage on this check. Failing the save or check by 5 or more results in the creature falling prone beside the cart.   |
|  4  | **Venomous Swarm:** The cart speeds past foliage containing swarms of venomous creatures. Each passenger is targeted by a melee weapon attack (+5 to hit) from these angered animals. On a hit, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. |
|  5  | **Spore Cloud:** The cart runs over mushroom clusters, which release blinding spores. The horses and passengers must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. While blinded this way, their speed is halved.|
|  6  | The lizardmen are attempting to eradicate the civilizations of the warmbloods, and the dread saurian leads the siege of a capital city. |
|  7  | **Razor-Sharp Bramble:** The cart moves through sharp brambles. The horses and passengers must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or receive a Carnosaur Wound. |
|  8  | **Tangled Roots:** Thick roots obstruct the cart's path. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the cart's wheels become tangled with roots, cutting its speed in half until they are removed. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check to free the roots from the cart. |

|   | |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  9  | **Fallen Log:** A massive log blocks the way. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the log becomes 20 feet of difficult terrain and damages the cart as if Guldbloom's Terror tore a piece off it.|
|  10  | **Snake Statue:** The cart passes by a mysterious snake statue that emits a mesmerizing aura. Passengers must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or stumble out of the cart. If they fail by 5 or more, they fall prone beside the cart. |
|  11  | **Low Hanging Branches:** The cart moves through an area with particularly low tree branches. Each creature in the cart must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw to avoid being hit by a branch and knocked out of the cart. On a failed save, a creature is knocked over the cart's side, rendering its hands unusable as it hangs from the edge. That creature or another creature in the cart can make a DC 15 Strength check to pull it back in. A creature in the cart has advantage on this check. Failing the save or check by 5 or more results in the creature falling prone beside the cart.  |
|  12  | **Dinosaur Stampede:** A herd of frightened dinosaurs crosses the cart's path. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Vehicle) check or the cart is damaged as if it has a piece torn out by Guldbloom's Terror. |
|  13  | **Blood Suckers:** Swarms of bloodthirsty insects attack. Each passenger and the horses are targeted by a melee weapon attack (+5 to hit). On a hit, the target receives a Carnosaur Wound.|
|  14  | **Muddy Ground:** The cart enters a muddy area. The driver must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Land Wehicle) check or the mud becomes 30 feet of difficult terrain for the cart. |
|  15  | **Shrine of the Beast God:** The cart passes a shrine dedicated to an ancient beast god that hums with power and seems to be visibly invigorating Guldbloom's Terror. The shrine has 40 hit points and an AC of 15. If not destroyed within one round, it boosts the speed of Guldbloom's Terror by 10 feet for an hour.  |
|  16-20  | No complication |

<br>

#### The Ceradon
If the chase lasts for 5 rounds, on the 5th round, instead of rolling for a complication, the cart passes by a ceradon, which is provoked into attacking Guldbloom's Terror. The players can chose to stop and fight Guldbloom's Terror while it is being attacked by the ceradon, or they can flee while they have this opportunity.

\pagebreakNum

### Aftermath
The aftermath of this encounter will depend on how the chase ends:

* **The Players Get 250 Ft. or More Away From Guldbloom's Terror:**<br>
At this point, the players have gotten far enough away from the carnosaur that they can make their escape unimpeded.

* **The Cart is Destroyed**<br>
If the carnosaur disables the cart, Guldbloom's Terror will prioritize devouring the explorer and the cart's horses before turning to the players unless any of the players go out of their way to aggravate it and get its attention. This distraction can give the players the chance to flee into the dense jungle and attempt to hide if a direct fight is too much for them to handle.<br> Otherwise, if they've managed to damage the carnosaur enough over the course of the chase, they may attempt to stand their ground and finish it off. If you run a combat encounter in this scenario, use the encounter map with the broken wagon.

* **Guldbloom's Terror Gets Within Melee Range of a Player Not in The Cart** <br>
In this scenario, Guldbloom's Terror is able to initiate combat against a player who has no easy means of fleeing. If the players don't quickly find a way to slip away back into a chase, you will likely need to begin combat. You can use the version of the encounter map without a broken wagon for this.

* **The Players Reach the Ceradon:**<br> In this scenario, a ceradon attacks Guldbloom's Terror, allowing the players to make their getaway. Alternatively, they can choose to assist the ceradon in attempting to kill Guldbloom's Terror. You can use the version of the encounter map without a broken wagon to run combat for this.<br>As long as the players keep their distance from the ceradon and don't provoke it, it will not bother attacking them and be content with killing and eating the carnosaur. 

#### Loot
If you wish to provide a significant loot reward for this encounter, you can have the explorer (or his next of kin) award the players with approximately 1000 gp worth of treasure he looted during his jungle explorations. This treasure can come in the form of gold pieces or gems and art objects. If this was the final encounter of a larger adventure, you could award an entire treasure hoard.

If the players manage to slay Guldbloom's Terror, they may also be able to harvest its body using the loot tables described in the Encounter Reference Material. However, if they slay the carnosaur with the aid of the ceradon, the ceradon will claim the body for itself and attempt to drive off anyone trying to harvest it.

\columnbreak

#### XP Award: 14,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in escaping or defeating Guldbloom's Terror can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players slay Guldbloom's Terror and are able to harvest its body for loot.
* **100% XP:** The players escape Guldbloom's Terror or slay it with the aid of the cer0don, but the cerodon drives them off.
* **50% XP:** The players escape Guldbloom's Terror but the cart is destroyed or the explorer is killed.
* **10% XP:** The players lose the cart and are now fleeing for their lives through the jungle on foot.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If you're playing with a group of significantly lower-level players, you can use the easier variant of this encounter described below:

**Easier Encounter (Level 6-8).** Replace Guldbloom's Terror with a normal carnosaur with Blessing of the Hunter God and change the DCs for chase complications to 14. Change the XP Award to 6,000 XP.




### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The players have successfully retrieved a powerful artifact needed to save the world, but the dread saurian presents the final obstacle to their escape.|
|  2  | The lizardmen are attempting to eradicate the civilizations of the warmbloods, and the dread saurian leads the siege of a capital city. |
|  3  | The players have defeated a lizardman leader who was threatening the world with a campaign of genocidal conquest. However, his skink attendants now seek revenge from atop the back of their dread saurian.  |
|  4  | The world is being racked by tears in space and time which have carried a dread saurian from the primordial past into the present. |

### Dread Saurian Artifacts

The dread saurian can be equipped with a magical artifact that grants it additional abilities and increases its CR by 2.

#### Spirit Eye

*A mystic crystal is embedded in the dread saurian, which allows it to call forth primal warriors from ages past.*

At the start of its turn, the dread saurian can summon three specters in unoccupied spaces within 90 feet of it. The specters act immediately after the dread saurian on the same initiative count and fight until they are destroyed. They disappear after 1 minute or when the dread saurian dies. The specters summoned with this ability have the following changes:
* They are not affected by Sunlight Sensitivity.
* They have a melee spell attack instead of Life Drain. The attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and targets one creature. On a hit, the attack deals 10 (3d6) force damage


#### Heart of Stone

*A large, eldritch stone is fused into the back of the dread saurian. The dread saurian can use the stone to draw the power of the earth into its body and become as unyielding as a mountain.*

At the end of the dread saurian's turn, if it has not moved on that turn and is standing on earth or stone, it gains a +3 bonus to AC, saving throws, and opposed checks. This ability can stack up to two times. The dread saurian loses all stacks if it moves or is forced to move.

While equipped with this artifact, the dread saurian's Primal Instinct ability is triggered only by it becoming charmed or frightened.



#### Mantle of the Blazing Dawn 

*Strange golden patterns are etched across the dread saurian’s scales. As the beast charges, the markings flare and burn with divine radiance.*

Claw attacks made by the dread saurian when using its Obliterating Charge ability deal an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage and 10 (3d6) radiant damage on hit.




\pagebreakNum

#### Primal Jaws

*The dread saurian’s teeth are etched with runes and gilded with rare metal to honor the most ancient of bestial gods. When the dread suarian crushes foes with its sacred jaws, it awakens a primal vigor in its allies.*

When the dread saurian uses its Crushing Jaws on a hostile creature, it and each ally within 100 feet of it gain 20 temporary hit points for the next minute. If the creature fails the saving throw against Crushing Jaws, they each gain 30 temporary hit points instead. If it fails by 10 or more, they each gain 40 temporary hit points instead.

#### Rebus of the Jungle

*Stange, magical, light-bending vines grow across the dread saurian and help mask its presence. These plants also help it to move through dense undergrowth undetected by its prey.*   

The dread saurian gets +11 to stealth checks and can move though plants without being slowed, taking damage, being grappled or restrained.

While dread saurian is lightly obscured, it is invisible to any creatures more then 10 feet away form it. If the dread saurian has a Howdah, the Howdah and the  Creatures inside of it gain this benefit as well

#### Figures of Dread

*The dread saurian wears a massive headdress lined with menacing statues, amplifying its already terrifying nature such that none can look upon it without experiencing mortal terror.*

The following ability replaces the dread saurian’s Frightful Presence:

 ***Dread Presence.*** Each creature of the dread saurian's choice within 120 feet that is aware of it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. All creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw unless they are within 5 feet of an ally. Creatures normally immune to being frightened can still be affected, but have advantage on their saves. While frightened, the creature can only use its actions to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or steel its resolve. A creature that uses its action to steel its resolve can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the dread saurian's Dread Presence for the next 24 hours.

### Howdahs

You can choose to equip a dread saurian with a small, armored fort on its back known as a howdah. This howdah is a magic object with 100 hit points and an AC 19. Up to 10 Medium or smaller creatures can ride in the howdah without squeezing. All creatures within the howdah count as being within 5 feet of each other. 

**Entering the Howdah.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the dread saurian is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the dread saurian succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah until the start of its next turn, and any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted. 

The dread saurian may then immediately make an opportunity attack against the creature. If the dread saurian fails, the creature enters the howdah.

**Melee Attacks Against Creatures Within The Howdah.** To make a melee attack against a target in the howdah while outside of it, a creature must be within 5 feet of the dread saurian, and if the creature isn’t Huge or larger, the attack must have a reach of at least 20 feet.

**Protective Effects** When creatures are in the howdah, they are protected by powerful wards. They have three-quarters cover against attacks and effects from outside of it and a +5 bonus to all saving throws, not just Dexterity saves. If a creature in the howdah is subjected to an effect from outside that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half damage if it fails.

**Being Knocked Prone** If the dread saurian is knocked prone, the howdah takes 30 bludgeoning damage.

**Teleporting.** If the dread saurian is teleported, the howdah is teleported with it. Creatures in the howdah may choose to teleport with the dread saurian.

**Destruction.** If the dread saurian dies, the howdah is destroyed. When the howdah is destroyed, creatures that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the dread saurian.






#### Howdah Weapons

The howdah has built-in weapons that can be fired by the creature's within. Each weapon can only be fired once per turn. For every giant bow or giant blowpipe you equip the howdah with, increase the dread saurian's CR by 1.

##### Ballista

When using a giant bow, it takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. The creature aiming the weapon chooses the target and must also be the one to fire it. When fired, the arrow flies in a straight line up to 480 feet in a direction of the user's choice before falling to the ground.

If the arrow would strike a target, the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if the arrow has flown 120 feet or more. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or destroyed, the bolt keeps flying and deals 11 (2d10) less damage if it hits another target. Otherwise, the arrow's flight ends early.


##### Giant Blowpipe

When using a giant blowpipe, it takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. The creature aiming the weapon must be the one to fire it. When fired, it does the following:

Darts rain down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot radius centered on the point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (5d4) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, and makes the saving throw at the end of its turn against the poison with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, but does not have disadvantage on the saving throw at the end of its turn against the poison.

 ### Dread Saurian Loot
The valuable items looted from dread saurians will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them and whatever sacred items they’ve been adorned with. Harvesting a dread saurian’s body can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. Looting their adornments will usually involve an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest its hide.

Players should be able to do both forms of harvesting at once using separate checks for most dread saurians. 

If a dread saurian is equipped with an artifact, you can make a second roll for adornment loot. Alternatively, the players may recover a functional magic item from the artifact.


#### Dread Saurian Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.

### Dread Saurian Tactics
Dread Saurians are extremely belligerent and consistently seek to attack the largest group of enemies to inflict the most damage possible. They rarely consider going after the weakest targets. Their belligerence is so extreme that dread saurians will usually fight to the death, rampaging to the very end.

#### Dread Saurian Shredder Tactics
The only real difference in tactics with a dread saurian shredder involves its legendary actions, which are used in the following circumstances:

* **Swat.** This is used when dread saurian has a creature in its mouth, and another creature is causing a large amount of damage that it wishes to be rid of.
* **Mangle.** If the dread saurian doesn't have any creature in its mouth and is attempting to catch fleeing prey, it will usually use this after using an obliterating charge.
* **Gnaw.** The dread saurian will use this action whenever possible, unless under the effects of a debilitating condition where it needs to use Tenacious Will.
* **Obliterating Charge.** The dread saurian uses this action to catch up with fleeing prey.

#### Dread Saurian Howdah Tactics
Dread saurians on their own are generally not a significant threat to high-level parties as their dimwitted tactics and basic attacks can usually be countered by the many options players have at those levels. However, a howdah allows dread saurians to be directed by intelligent creatures and should be filled with riders equipped with ranged attacks to create a more well-rounded threat.

The creatures in the howdah do not have to be tough, as the +5 to all saving throws, AC from cover, and damage reduction mean that the crew is well-defended as long as they stay within the structure. Their job should be to eliminate targets the dread saurian cannot reach.

\columnbreak

#### Dread Saurian Artifact Tactics
Dread Saurian upgrades can allow it to present a higher-level and more complex challenge. Here are some basic tactics for several upgrades:
* **Spirit Eye.** This is similar to the howdah in that it compensates for the dread saurian’s weakness to ranged attacks and flying creatures. The summoned spirits can disrupt enemies the dread saurian can’t reach, and their intelligence allows them to do this in tactical ways that support the dread saurian.
* **Heart of Stone.** With this upgrade, it’s best to grab one target and chew it relentlessly, only moving if there’s no one left to attack. It works well in combination with a howdah.
* **Mantle of the Blazing Dawn** With this upgrade, the dread saurian should make an obliterating charge whenever it can hit three or more targets.
* **Jaws of the Savage** This upgrade works well in combination with a howdah or other minions.
* **Rebus of the Jungle** This upgrade allows the dread saurian to behave more like an ambush predator. When it’s not rampaging, the dread saurian’s strategy should be to lure targets into underbrush and darkness.
* **Figures of Dread** This upgrade does little to change the dread saurian’s tactics.
