## Nest of the Cold Ones <br> (Player Levels: 8-10)
In this encounter, the players venture into the underground nest of a cold one pack to retrieve eggs. The nest is guarded by saurus warriors riding atop cold ones who use the nest as a breeding ground for their mounts. The eggs initially appear to only be guarded by a pair of saurus warriors mounted on cold ones, but more reinforcements quickly appear at the nest’s multiple entrances.


### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players have been tasked with collecting as many eggs from the nest as possible. Their reward should scale with the number of eggs they retrieve. For example, they may be getting paid per egg they bring back. The players should also be aware that there are three entrances going into and out of the nests and roughly where they are on the map before entering the nest. While approaching the nest, they will also spot multiple cold one riders patrolling nearby, which should clue them in that many reinforcements could show up during a fight in the nest.
### Map Description

* **Lighting.** If there is daylight, there will be dim light at the cave entrances and no light within the main chamber.
* **The Cave.** The cave’s ceiling is 30 ft. high. 


### Lead Up

The encounter begins with the players entering through any of the nest’s three entrances. Ideally, they will have entered stealthily, and there should be enough cover outside the nest for them to attempt to do so. If they come in and the cold one riders outside the nest are already aware of their presence, they will have to immediately start dealing with reinforcements (see below).

### Running the Encounter
All the cold ones are ridden by saurus warriors with the Blessing of the Beast God. At first, there will only be a pair of riders, but reinforcements will quickly start appearing. The players must contend with the riders and use the environment to their advantage as they try to scoop up eggs.

#### Cold One Reinforcements
Once the cold ones in the nest are aware of the intruders, they will let loose a roar, alerting those outside to the presence of intruders. 

At the start of every turn, pick one of the nest entrances at random (you can use a d6). The players will hear a roar coming from the chosen entrance, heralding reinforcements. Roll initiative for a saurus cold one rider, and on its turn, have it use 20 feet of its movement for that turn to appear on the map at the chosen entrance. It can then take the remainder of its turn.

##### Map Legend
* **C:** Cold One Rider Start Location
* <font color="Purple"> **E:** Egg Location </font>
* <font color="7D6608"> **B:** Boulder Start Location </font>
* <font color="Green">**Green:** Elevation Changes </font>

<br>

If you randomly pick an entrance blocked by a boulder or other similarly sturdy barrier, no cold one appears that turn. 

Additionally, if there are 4 or more riders in the chamber, you can slow the rate of new cold one riders to once every two turns. And if there are 6 or more, it will probably be best to not have any more appear to 

#### The Eggs
The eggs should be considered Tiny, CR 0 creatures that are perpetually paralyzed, with an AC 5 and 5 hit points. A Small or larger creature can use an action to pick one up and stow it in a pack. A creature can attempt to hastily pick one up using an object interaction. When doing so, they must make a DC 11 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. If they have two hands free, they have advantage on this check. On a success, they pick up the egg without damaging it. On a failure, they fumble and destroy the egg.

Once an egg is stowed in a pack, it is safe from all other effects and has total cover.

\pagebreakNum

#### The Boulders
The boulders are Large objects with an AC 17 and 40 hit points. A creature can make a shove attack against a boulder to attempt to push it along a path with minor resistance (shown by the yellow arrows on the map). The creature must roll a 14 or higher on its shove attempt to successfully move the boulder down the hill. If the creature attempts to push the boulder in a direction with more resistance, it has disadvantage on its shove. 

Once a boulder is pushed in either of the low-resistance directions shown on the map, it will roll all the way to the end of the arrow. Any creature in the boulder’s path must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or take 21 (6d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Once the boulder stops moving, any creatures in its space are pushed out of this area.

Once a boulder has been moved, further attempts to move it using a shove must roll an 18 or higher.

If a boulder is rolled into an entrance area of the map, it will prevent reinforcements from coming into the nest through that entrance. 

> ##### Communicating to Players
> It may not be clear to players first entering the nest that all three tunnels are exits and that boulders can be used to block the exits and hinder the cold one reinforcements. Make sure they are clear on the tunnel layout and hint that the boulders look like they could be pushed and seem large enough to block a tunnel.


#### Cold One Rider Tactics
The primary goal of the cold one riders is to prevent the players from escaping with eggs. The cold ones can smell who is carrying their eggs and focus their aggression on whoever is carrying the most. Beyond this prioritization, the cold one riders will not use any sophisticated tactics beyond their typical attack strategies, and once they enter a rampage, even their prioritization of attacking egg carries will fall by the wayside. 

### Aftermath
Once the players escape the nest, their main options will be hiding or running from the remaining cold one riders. There should be enough thick jungle overgrowth that they can attempt to make a stealthy getaway. If they make a run for it, you can use the chase mechanics described in the DMG. There should be enough jungle obstacles they can use to impede larger cold ones and help make up for the players’ lack of speed. 

#### Loot
If the players will receive a cash reward for the eggs, roll for the coins on a treasure horde table of the appropriate CR for the players from the DMG and award them approximately 1/4 of that amount per egg they recover. 

\columnbreak

#### XP Award
For each egg stash the players successfully recover, award them 2,000 XP. 



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Remove the saurus warriors from the encounter so that each cold one is riderless.  Change the XP per egg to 1,000xp.

**Harder Encounter.** Replace the cold ones with horned ones. Change the XP per egg to 3,000xp.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | Something is corrupting the local wildlife, and the players have been tasked with collecting eggs for study to identify the source of the corruption. |
|  2  | An army at war with the lizardmen wants to collect cold one eggs in hopes of training their own cold one cavalry to counter that of the saurus warriors.   |
|  3  | The players are collecting the eggs for a deranged wizard posing as a biologist who secretly wishes to warp them into twisted minions.|
|  4  | A druid has asked the players to snatch away the cold one eggs so she can take them somewhere they won’t be raised for war.|

<br>

> ##### The Rampaging Condition
> All the creatures in this document have abilities that cause them to enter a rampage. Rampages last for one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: <br>
> &#8226;  Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.<br>
> &#8226; The creature must take the Attack action on each of its turns, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see unless there are no creatures it can reach with an attack. <br>
> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>
> &#8226;  The creature can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

#### Blessing of the Beast God

*These lizardmen are marked with elaborate crests containing striking colors and possess an instinctive kinship with other beasts who possess the same primal instincts.*

If the saurus has a controlled mount with the Primal Instinct ability, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the saurus’s turns.

Additionally, while the saurus or the creature it is mounted on is rampaging, attacks of the saurus and the mount deal an additional 9 (2d8) damage on hit.

Finally, If the saurus is rampaging, it may choose not to move on its turn if it is mounted, even if this would prevent it from being able to attack.

## Creature Tactics

### Cold One Tactics

Cold ones are hyper-aggressive and have very low intelligence. Outside of making use of their Pack Tactics ability whenever possible, they don’t have any sophisticated combat tactics. They will simply try to gang up on and bring down the weakest prey they can spot. Allow them to fall for most ploys the party attempts, and let the players use their stupidity against them.

When used as mounts, their tactics will reflect that of the rider. However, the optimal strategy will still usually be to run down and gang up on vulnerable targets while hoping the cold one doesn’t rapamge in the process.

#### Horned Ones

This variant should be played more intelligently and not fall for obvious ploys the same way cold ones would. 

**Charge + Pact Tactics.** Whenever possible, horned ones should use their Charge ability to target an enemy who has an ally within 5 feet of it, so they can combine it with their Pact Tactics. If they are mounted, this will be a non-issue.

### Saurus Tactics
Saurus are direct and aggressive in their combat tactics and will usually fight to the death regardless of how dire their circumstances seem. They usually charge headlong into their foes, though they aren’t stupid about how they approach and won’t stumble into obvious traps or allow themselves to easily be put in a disadvantageous position. Saurus instinctively understand how to flank and outmaneuver foes, and they can usually pick out soft targets that need to be taken down first. 

Saurus are slightly stronger than other creatures at their CR because their Primal Instinct ability provides an exploitable weakness. As a DM, it’s important to communicate to the players when a saurus enters into a rampage what effect this appears to have on it. This way, clever players can use it to their advantage. 

#### Saurus Warriors
&emsp;**Bite.** Use this by default unless there is a commander ordering it not to. Because using bite has a chance to cause the saurus to rampage but also get another bite as a bonus action, the commander may order them to start using this attack if they are below 50 hit points and, therefore, close to rampaging anyway. Saurus will always use this in place of a shield attack if they’re rampaging.

**Maul.** Use this every turn as it is the most powerful attack.

**Shield.** Use this if a commander orders them to not use bites to avoid going into a rampage. Saurus won’t use this attack if they’re rampaging.

## Loot Tables

### Cold One Loot
The valuable items looted from cold ones will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cold one.

#### Cold One Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Cold One Loot Table


| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-6  | 1 5gp Item |
|  7-9 | 1d4(2) 5gp Items | 
|  10-22 | 1 10gp Item  |  
|  23+ |  1 20gp Item |  


##### Horned One Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |

|  11-16 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items  |  
|  17-22 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items |  
|  23+ |  1d4(2) 20gp Items |  
 



#### Example Cold One Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.



##### Example Cold One Item Names
|1d4 | 5gp Item | 10gp Item | 20gp Item |

| 4 <br> (Hide) | Tattered Cold One Hide| Cold One Hide |  Pristine Cold One Hide  |

\columnbreak

### Saurus Loot
Because Saurus are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Saurus Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
