## Escape Across The Saurian Bridge <br> (Player Levels: 8-10)
In this encounter, the players are under attack by waves of saurian crossing an ancient stone bridge, which they must blow up to stem the tide of lizardmen. An NPC scout has the blasting charges and will set them up on the bridge but needs the players to hold back the saurian.


### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players are on a jungle adventure pitted against hordes of saurian warriors. Their NPC companion has the stats for a scout and is skilled with setting explosives, but other than that, the scout can be whoever would best fit in your adventure. The players should be aware of the overwhelming number of saurian converging on their position and that destroying the bridge is the best way to prevent pursuit.

### Map Description

* **Lighting.** The lighting will depend on the time of day, though if it’s mid-day, much of the canopy away from the river will be dimly lit due to the heavy tree cover.
* **The Bridge.** The structure is made of stone and will be immune to all damage from conventional weapons.
* **Jungle Flora.** The low underbrush around the bridge can be used to hide. The trees they surround reach an average of 20 feet high and can be climbed using a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **River.** There is a 40-foot drop down to the river, which is 20 feet deep and rapidly flows from top to bottom. Creatures that fall in and don’t wish to be carried downstream must use their action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check at the start of their turn. If the creature has fallen into the water since the end of its last turn, it has disadvantage on this check. On a success, the creature can swim through the water, though swimming upstream costs twice as much movement. On a failure, the creature flounders and is carried 20 feet downstream.
* **Statues and Tower.** There are two 10-foot tall statues on the left side of the bridge and a 20-foot tall watch tower with stairs on the right side.

### Lead Up

The encounter begins with the players on the left side of the map near the bridge. They will likely have just fled from where ever the saurian are coming from. The scout will yell for them to provide cover as the charges are being laid and they make their way across the bridge. 

### Running the Encounter
As the DM, you will be running both the saurian attackers and the scout setting the blasting charges.

#### The Saurian Attackers
On initiative count 20 of each round, new saurian enemies will appear at the right edge of the map, at which point you should roll initiative for the saurian and have them act that round. A pair of saurian warriors will appear each round for the first two rounds, with a saurian scar commander appearing on the third round. This pattern will continue every three rounds: two warriors for two rounds, then a scar commander. 

All the saurian should have a Blessing of the Old Ones (described later in the document). 

##### Saurian Combat Tactics
The saurian are performing an all-out attack as they move their forces across the bridge, slaying everyone in their way. They will generally target the most fragile or weakened enemy they can reach on any given turn. Unless they are rampaging, they will use standard melee warrior tactics such as flanking and closing in on fragile ranged characters. They will also take the opportunity to attack anyone setting charges whenever possible.

More general saurian tactics can be found later in the document.

\pagebreakNum


#### The Scout and Blasting Charges
The scout’s goal is to set a blast charge at each of the six points marked on the map and then blow the bridge. Setting a charge requires an action, and the scout must be within 5 feet of the marked location to do so. The scout will avoid combat whenever possible and won’t run into danger without backup from the players. Once every charge is set, the scout will retreat to the left side of the bridge and use an action to detonate the charges. 


##### Players Setting Charges
The PCs can help the scout set the charges (passing a charge to a player requires an object interaction), but doing so hinges on having alchemical knowledge of how to arm them safely. A PC using action to set a charge must succeed on a DC 12 Intelligence (Alchemist’s Tools) check, or the charge isn’t set, and the action is wasted (the player may make this check without having proficiency in Alchemist’s Tools). If the player gets a 7 or lower on the check, they accidentally detonate the charge and take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and 10 (3d6) fire damage.



##### Blowing the Bridge
Once all the charges are set, the scout can use an action to use the detonator and blow the bridge. If necessary, a player can attempt to use the detonator by using an action to make a DC 12 Intelligence (Alchemist’s Tools) check. When the bridge is blown, all creatures within 10 feet of it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and 10 (3d6) fire damage on failure, and half as much on a success. Creatures standing on the bridge have disadvantage on this save and automatically fall into the water below.

If all the charges aren’t set properly before they are detonated, the bridge will be damaged but still crossable. 


### Aftermath

If the bridge is blown, the players will have successfully halted the attack. The lizardmen may find another way to cross the river and press the assault, but at the very least, the players have bought themselves time.

If the players flee before destroying the bridge, they will have to deal with pursuit from the saurian. This could result in a chase scene through the jungle (chase rules can be found in the DMG), and there may be graver long-term consequences depending on the nature of the adventure.

#### Loot
This encounter is not ideal for providing loot to the players as most of what the saurian carry will be lost when the bridge is blown. If the scout has hired the players to do a job and this is the final encounter of their mission, they may be given a cash reward for their success. A treasure horde of the appropriate challenge rating from the DMG would make a good baseline for such a reward.

\columnbreak

#### XP Award: 7,500xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the skinks can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players blew up the bridge without anyone (including the scout) falling in the river, dropping to 0 HP, or getting stuck on the other side.
* **100% XP:** The players blew up the bridge, but someone fell in the river, was left behind, or dropped to 0 HP.
* **50% XP:** The players only damaged the bridge before fleeing.
* **10% XP:** The players fled with the bridge still undamaged.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-7).** Remove the blessings from the saurian warrior pairs, and replace the scar commander with a sacred saurian with a blessing.  Change the XP Award to 5,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 11-13).** Replace the saurian warriors with blessings with sacred saurian with blessings, and replace the scar commander with a saurian elder blood with a blessing. Change the XP award to 13,000 XP.


### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The players are blowing the bridge to force the lizardmen to move through another location that will work to the players’ advantage.|
|  2  | The players are fleeing after obtaining a valuable relic. All that remains is escaping across the bridge with it.  |
|  3  | The lizardmen are moving to assault a nearby settlement. The players are blowing the bridge to slow their forces down and buy time for people to flee or mount a defense.  |
|  4  | The players are making their way into lizardman territory, and blowing the bridge is a way to buy themselves time to complete their objective without being overwhelmed by saurian.|

### Blessings of the Old Ones
Some saurian warriors are spawned with enhanced abilities attributed to their ancient gods. These saurian's bear colorations that signify their specialized abilities and the unique ways they can serve their masters. Applying a blessing increases the saurian’s CR by 1.

When a saurian in the encounter is described as having a blessing, you can use any of the following options. However, the blessings of the Beast God and Hunter God won’t be as useful for this particular encounter, and so should only be used if they fit within the context of a larger adventure.  

#### Blessing of the Beast God

*These lizardmen are marked with elaborate crests containing striking colors and possess an instinctive kinship with other beasts who possess the same primal instincts.*

If the saurian has a controlled mount with the Primal Instinct ability, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the saurian’s turns.

Additionally, while the saurian or the creature it is mounted on is rampaging, attacks of the saurian and the mount deal an additional 9 (2d8) damage on hit.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Finally, If the saurian is rampaging, it may choose not to move on its turn if it is mounted, even if this would prevent it from being able to attack.

#### Blessing of the Blood God

*These hyper-aggressive lizardmen are marked with blood-red scales and infused with a ferocity that drives them to slaughter in their god’s name.*

While the saurian is rampaging, its has advantage on attack rolls and deals additional 11 (2d10) damage on hit.



#### Blessing of the God of Fate

*These lizardmen are marked by the oldest of gods with pure white scales and are said to be destined for greatness as fate itself bends to their will.*

At the start of saurian’s turns, it can choose to be under the effects of the *foresight* spell until the end of its next turn.

Once the saurian uses this feature, it can't use it again until it finishes a long rest.



\pagebreakNum

#### Blessing of the Hunter God

 *These saurian are marked with a brown spotted coloration to help them blend into the wilderness, and they possess superior predatory instincts that allow them to stalk prey through the thickest jungles.*

The saurian has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage and may do so even if it is only lightly obscured.

Additionally, the saurian has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. 

Finally, the saurian can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage,  or being grappled or restrained by them.

#### Blessing of the Protector God

*These lizardmen are marked with bony nobs and thick scales of a glittering silver color that deflect ranged attacks.*

While the saurian isn’t rampaging, when a creature 10 or more feet away from it hits it with an attack or deals damage to it with a spell, the damage is halved.

#### Blessing of the River God

*These aquatic lizardmen are marked with sea-green hues, gills, webbed claws, and crocodilian jaws they can use to drag their foes to a watery grave.* <br>
The saurian has a swim speed of 40 ft. and can breathe underwater.

When the saurian hits a creature with its bite attack, the target is grappled (escape DC equal to 8 + the Saurian’s Strength Modifier + Its Proficiency Bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the saurian can't bite another target.



#### Blessing of the Stoic God

*These saurian are marked with yellow lines down their body that signify their impassive nature and level-headedness during combat.*

The saurian adds +3 to its Wisdom, Charisma, and Intelligence saving throws and has resistance to psychic damage.

Additionally, its Primal Instinct feature is only triggered by it becoming charmed or frightened.

#### Blessing of the Sun God

*These energetic lizardmen are marked with the orange of the setting sun across their scales, and their sun god's power drives them to chase down their prey at alarming speeds.*

The saurian has advantage on intuitive rolls, and its speed is increased by 10 feet. If it would enter a rampage, it may use its reaction to move up to its speed toward any enemy it can see without provoking attacks of opportunity before its rampage begins.

#### Blessing of the Wind God

*These mystical lizardmen are marked with shimmering purple scales and possess primal wards that can sweep away enemy magics.*

The saurian can cast *counterspell* once per day without any components, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability. Its Primal Instinct ability is triggered when it casts the spell this way. (It can't cast the spell while rampaging.)

\columnbreak

### Saurian Tactics
Saurian are direct and aggressive in their combat tactics and will usually fight to the death regardless of how dire their circumstances seem. They usually charge headlong into their foes, though they aren’t stupid about how they approach and won’t stumble into obvious traps or allow themselves to easily be put in a disadvantageous position. Saurian instinctively understand how to flank and outmaneuver foes, and they can usually pick out soft targets that need to be taken down first. 

Saurian are slightly stronger than other creatures at their CR because their Primal Instinct ability provides an exploitable weakness. As a DM, it’s important to communicate to the players when a saurian enters into a rampage what effect this appears to have on it. This way, clever players can use it to their advantage. 

#### Saurian Warriors
&emsp;**Bite.** Use this by default unless there is a commander ordering it not to. Because using bite has a chance to cause the saurian to rampage but also get another bite as a bonus action, the commander may order them to start using this attack if they are below 50 hit points and, therefore, close to rampaging anyway. Saurian will always use this in place of a shield attack if they’re rampaging.

**Maul.** Use this every turn as it is the most powerful attack.

**Shield.** Use this if a commander orders them to not use bites to avoid going into a rampage. Saurian won’t use this attack if they’re rampaging.



#### Sacred Saurian
These saurian follow mostly the same tactics as normal warriors. If they have blessings that work with the rampage condition, there may be more circumstances in which they use their bite to try and enter a rampage early.

#### Saurian Scar Veterens and Elder Bloods
While under the control of a saurian commander, other saurian will be much more tactical in how they attack and use their abilities. Saurian commanders have the following abilities they can use to influence the battle:

**Bite.** Because the saurian rolls 2d6 for damage, there is a much higher chance of this attack causing it to enter a rampage. The saurian will avoid using this attack unless it believes entering a rampage for the extra damage from its Primal Command aura will help its forces win the fight.

**Head Cracking Maul.** This is the saurian’s most damaging attack, and it will use it every turn, prioritizing spellcasters whenever it can.

**Puncturing Shield.** This attack is ideal against creatures with low strength and in situations where there aren’t too many enemies able to immediately make counterattacks against the saurian, so the loss of AC is manageable.

**Primal Command.** Because this aura suppresses the rampage condition, saurian within it will use their bite attacks as much as possible to try to score an extra bonus action bite without fear of succumbing to the effects of the rampage. 

**Tail Slam.** The knock-back from this attack makes it a useful escape tool or a way to push enemies apart to give other lizardmen a chance to gain better positioning. 

\pagebreakNum

### Saurian Loot
Because saurian are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Saurian Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
