## Stomping Grounds <br> (Player Level: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players find an abandoned jungle camp shortly before being attacked by a stampeding ceradon equipped with a howdah crewed by lizardmen skinks.

### Encounter Context
The encounter requires the players to have recently arrived at a jungle encampment that was recently abandoned due to constant harassment from lizardmen patrols. The players could have been asked to come in and evacuate the camp or help secure it against further attacks, or they may have just stumbled upon it during their travels. If the camp was suffering harassment, it would have been on a small scale, and no one would be aware of the powerful ceradon the lizardmen have at their disposal.

### Lead Up
The party should find the camp relatively intact as a fierce thunderstorm starts rolling in. The gate is slightly open, and most of the camp's contents appear undisturbed. Not long after the players have explored the camp, the ceradon will arrive at the camp. The skinks controlling the ceradon will have been made aware of intruders approaching the camp, and attempt to sneak up on the players there, using the cover of the storm to give the ceradon advantage on its Stealth check.


### Map Description
* **Weather.** The intense rain lightly obscures all creatures, imposes disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks relying on sight or hearing, and extinguishes all open flames. The rain is so heavy it also causes fire attacks and effects to only deal half as much damage.
* **Foliage.** The plants outside the camp are difficult terrain and provide half-cover against ranged attacks.
* **Camp Walls & Gate.** These wooden walls (including the gate) are 20 feet high, have an AC of 15, and have 30 hit points.
* **Camp Watchtowers.** Each watchtower is a 15-foot high object with an AC or 15 and 20 hit points. Creatures that are Medium or small can move under them unimpeded.
* **Tents.** The tents provide half-cover to creatures within them and are destroyed after 10 damage. A creature can make a DC 11 Strength check to knock a tent over. If a creature is inside a tent that has been knocked over, it is blinded and moves at half speed until it leaves the tent or cuts its way out using any attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.
* **Miscellaneous Objects.** The camp contains many random objects that are roughly 5 feet tall and can be used to half-cover. The generally have an AC of 15 and 20 hit points.

### Combat
The fight consists of an ancient ceradon with a howah equipped with a giant blowpipe and a poison ballista. The howdah is crewed by 5 skink warriors.

The ceradon and skink riders will enter from the side of the map and begin by smashing their way through the camp wall. Once they enter the camp, their goal will be to crush the players and the rest of the camp in the process. They will fight using the general tactics used for ceradons and skinks, described in the Encounter Reference Material, later in this document.

#### Trampling Across Objects

If the ceradon runs into any of the camp objects described in the Map Description using its Trample ability, make a Strength check with a +3 modifier against the ceradon on behalf of the object. If the check fails, the object is destroyed, and the ceradon continues to move through the debris of the object as though its difficult terrain. If the check passes, the object takes 18 (2d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the ceradon's movement ends. This check automatically fails for tents. 

### Aftermath
The skinks' goal is to drive the players out of their territory. As long as they are in fighting condition, they will pursue the players until they feel their borders are secured. If the ceradon is severely wounded or killed, and the players are still in fighting shape, the skinks will attempt a retreat to get back up. If the skinks are killed, the ceradon will fight the players to the death without its handlers there to restrain it.

In any case, if one side flees and the other pursues, you can turn the encounter into a chase using the Chase rules described in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables the players can find from the skinks and ceradon. If you want to award a portion of a treasure hoard to the players, you can have them salvage money and art objects left behind in the camp. You can even give the players a side goal of trying to prevent the ceradon from destroying too much of the camp so that their treasure stays intact, and then reward the players with whatever wasn't crushed.

#### XP Award: 16,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ceradon and its riders can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The ceradon and skinks were defeated, none got away, and no more than half the camp has been decimated.
* **100% XP:** The ceradon and skinks were defeated, but some skinks escaped, or much of the camp has been destroyed.
* **50% XP:** The players slew the ceradon or all the skinks, but fled the remaining foes.
* **10% XP:** The players fled without slaying the ceradon or all the skinks.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Very Easy Encounter (Level 5-7).** Replace all the enemies with a single ceradon without skinks or a howdah. Change the XP Award to 7,200 XP.

**Easy Encounter (Level 10-11).** Replace the ancient ceradon with a normal ceradon. Change the XP Award to 10,000 XP.

**Hard Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace all the enemies with the Thunderous One without skinks or a howdah. Change the XP award to 25,000 XP.

**Very Hard Encounter (Level 17-19).** Replace the ancient ceradon with the Thunderous One, replace the skink warriors with skink behemoth keepers, and give the howdah the Sacred Howdah upgrade. Change the XP award to 35,000 XP.




### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Forsaken Mission:** Within the ruins of the camp, players discover journals or maps hinting at an expedition's true goal – perhaps seeking a lost city, a treasure, or a fabled artifact. The expedition, funded by a wealthy benefactor, has gone silent, and the benefactor will pay handsomely for any information or for the retrieval of the sought-after item.|
|  2  | **Prisoners of the Lizardmen:** Tied and left as bait, survivors from the original camp expedition are held captive deep within the jungle by the lizardmen. Once a certain celestial alignment reaches its apex, they will be sacrificed in a significant ritual.|
|  3  | **Relics of Power:** Hidden among the wreckage of the camp, players find hints of a relic that the camp's prior inhabitants were searching for. This relic is believed to have the power to control or calm creatures like the ceradon.  |
|  4  | **Jungle War:** That attack wasn't isolated. Across the region, similar patrols have attacked other outposts and explorers. It seems a war brews between the lizardmen and those trying to settle in or near the jungle, forcing players to choose a side or find a way to broker peace|

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.



## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

\columnbreak

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.



#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

# Howdahs
War howdahs are small armored structured mounted to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use different types of howdahs in your games. They can be applied to howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own howdahs. 

## Howdah Rules
Howdahs are generally structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger war beast of some kind. The creatures within the howdah are referred to as riders, and the creature the howdah is mounted upon is referred to as its steed. If one of the riders is controlling the steed, that creature is the pilot. Howdah riders and steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a howdah or its steed, the howdah and its steed are moved together.

* **Controlled & Independant Steeds.** The howdah's steed can be a controlled or independent mount as described in the player's handbook. If it is controlled, there must be a pilot who is controlling it.


* **Entering & Exiting Howdahs.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah. Any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. Each passenger already inside the howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.



### Howdah Saving Throws
While objects normally automatically fail all Strength, Dexterity, and Constituion saving throws, howdahs are active parts of combat, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, you can use the following rules when howdahs are subject to such saving throws.


\columnbreak

#### Strength & Dexterity Saves
Howdahs equipped on an unencumbered steed do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as they can rely on their steed to make the save for them. If a howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, its steed must make the saving throw against the effect. If the steed succeeds on the save, the howdah passes the save.

#### Constitution Saves
Howdahs can make their own Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is mounted on a steed.

### Opportunity Attacks
When the howdah steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the howdah itself. Passengers cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures outside the howdah.

### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures inside a howdah are considered to be within 5 feet of each other.

### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of three of the steed's largest hit dice.

### Teleporting
If the steed is teleported, the howdah and its riders can choose to teleport with it.

### Falling Howdahs
When a howdah's steed falls from a height of 10 feet or more, it and all its riders take fall damage as usual, and the riders fall prone.

### Repairing Howdahs
If a howdah has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting repairs, provided it has the necessary tools and parts. After 1 hour of work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus if proficient with the required tools. On success, the howdah regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. On failure, the howdah doesn't regain any hit points, but repairs can be reattempted with the same tools and parts.

### Howdah Destruction
When a howdah is destroyed, riders that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of its steed.

\pagebreakNum




## Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, howdahs have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Howdah DC 
Whenever the howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, that creature uses this value for the DC.

### Damage Threshold
Most howdahs possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the howdah takes the damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the howdah's hit points.

###  Steed Size
This is the minimum size a creature must be to be the howdah's steed. If a creature ever becomes too small to carry the howdah, the howdah falls off the creature and is knocked over as though its steed was knocked prone, described in the Prone Howdahs section.

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride in the howdah comfortably. Additional creatures may be able to fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the howdah at the DM's discretion.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the howdah adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning howdah, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the howdah is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits the howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

### Siege Weapons
A howdah may have one or more built-in siege weapons. These siege weapons are built into the howdah and share its Hit Points, AC, and Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the howdah is destroyed. These siege weapons can only be operated by riders in the howdah, and riders can't provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the howdah while operating these weapons. The weapons can't be used if the howdah is not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.

## Lizardmen Howdahs

When lizardmen deploy their most titanic reptilian jungle monsters in combat, they are sometimes equipped with mighty war howdahs crewed by smaller lizardmen such as skinks. These howahs are wooden structures that allow an entire lizardman crew to ride atop a mighty steed. The structure provides cover for the crew and can be equppied with siege weapons and even an arcane Engine of the Gods which provides the lizardmen with magical aid. Most lizardmen monsters are far too wild to allow such structures on their back, so those that can be equipped this way are prized by the lizardmen.

Rules for howdahs and the siege weapons they can be equipped with are found at the end of the document.

### Lizardmen Howdah Upgrades

Large howdahs and huge howdahs can be given any of the following upgrades. Each upgrade increases the howdahs effective CR by 1 unless its states otherwise.


#### Sacred Howdah
*The howdah is not only an instrument of war but a small shrine complete with relics and offerings dedicated to the Old Ones to curry their favor.*

The howdah counts as a magic object, and the three-quarters cover granted by the howdah gives a +5 bonus to all saving throws from effects outside the howdah, not just Dexterity saves. If a creature in the howdah is subjected to an effect from outside that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half damage if it fails.

#### Poison Ballista 

*The howdah is equipped with a ballista whose bolts are tipped with deadly jungle toxins.*

The howdah is equipped with the poison ballista siege weapon.
___
> ## Poison Ballista 
> *Medium siege weapon*
>___
> - **Weapon DC** 15
> - **Armor Class** 15 
> - **Hit Points** 60 (damage threshold: 5)
>___
> - **Damage Immunities** poison, psychic
> - **Ammo** Poison Bolt (1 round, 100g)
> - **Challenge** 1 (200 XP)
> ___
>
> ### Functions
>
> ***Load.*** The weapon is loaded with a Poison Bolt. This must be done before it is prepped.
>
> ***Prep.*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done while it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The ballista fires a bolt that flies in a straight line up to 480 feet in the direction of the user's choice before falling to the ground. If the bolt would strike a target, that target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if the bolt has flown 120 feet or more. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or destroyed, the bolt keeps flying and deals 11 (2d10) less damage if it hits another target. Otherwise, the bolt's flight ends at the target's location.

#### Giant Blowpipe  
*The howdah is equipped with a giant blowpipe capable of firing a hail of poison-tipped darts.*

The howdah is equipped with the giant blowpipe siege weapon.
___
> ## Giant Blowpipe 
> *Medium siege weapon*
>___
> - **Weapon DC** 15
> - **Armor Class** 15 
> - **Hit Points** 60 (damage threshold: 5)
>___
> - **Damage Immunities** poison, psychic
> - **Ammo** Poison Dart Cluster (1 round, 100g)
> - **Challenge** 1 (200 XP)
> ___
>
> ### Functions
>
> ***Load.*** The weapon is loaded with a Poison Dart Cluster. This must be done before it is prepped.
>
> ***Prep.*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done while it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The blowpipe fires a barrage of darts that rain down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (5d4) piercing damage, is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, and makes the saving throw at the end of its turn against the toxins with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage, is still inflicted with Jungle Toxins, but does not have disadvantage on the saving throw at the end of its turn against the toxins.

<br>

> ##### Jungle Toxins
> At the end of the turn, each creature hit by one or more weapons that inflict Jungle Toxins must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that has been hit by two or more attacks from weapons with Jungle Toxins this turn makes the saving throw with disadvantage. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success or taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failure.

## Tactics & Loot
  
### Ceradon Tactics

Ceradons are territorial, highly aggressive, and omnivorous creatures. While they don't actively hunt prey, they will readily attack anything within charging distance. In battle, a ceradon is resolute and acts primarily on instinct. It focuses on adversaries it perceives as the greatest threat, often choosing targets dealing significant damage or those of considerable size. However, it lacks the intelligence to realize the potential benefits of trampling multiple targets for increased damage output.

If a ceradon starts an encounter already in melee combat, it will retreat, even if doing so exposes itself to opportunity attacks. To defend against such attacks, it employs its Armoured Crest reaction. Following the retreat, it starts charging foes with its Trample action. The ceradon will follow this up with its Gore attack. While it can't gore a target right beneath it, it can trample over a target before circling back to Gore, often doing so with an advantage. Once an opponent is impaled on its horns, the ceradon shifts focus to trampling nearby threats. If it pins another creature under its feet, it will continue its stomp attacks while standing atop the pinned foe.

#### Ceradons With Howdahs

Ceradons equipped with a howdah can display tactical battle acumen under their rider's guidance. They frequently trample through dense clusters of enemies. Even if their Gore attack misses, if the ceradon pins two or more creatures beneath it, it remains stationary, concentrating on crushing them. 

The Armoured Crest reaction is used strategically, saved for countering potent spell attacks or deflecting high damage strikes, such as a rogue's sneak attack.

##### Ceradon Howdah Weapons 

Skinks usually man the ceradon's howdah. They employ long-range poison weapons integrated into the howdah to target enemies beyond the ceradon's reach, especially when the ceradon is stationary because it's pinning victims or it's pursuing elusive targets.





#### The Thunderous One 

**Thunderous Wrath:** When the Thunderous One utilizes this ability, it repels adversaries not restrained by its feet or impaled on its horns, creating distance between it and its next target for an effective charge and Gore attack.





\columnbreak

##### Thunderous One Legendary Actions

The Thunderous One utilizes its legendary actions in the following ways:

**Storm God's Judgement:** This legendary action is reserved for use against a creature impaled on the ceradon's horns or trapped beneath its feet. The Thunderous One instinctively employs this legendary action in this way, even without external guidance.

**Trample:** If there are no eligible targets for Storm God's Judgement, the Thunderous One defaults to this action. When under the guidance of more intelligent beings, it prefers to use this ability if it can potentially overrun more adversaries than those already pinned beneath it.

**Tenacious Will:** This action is invoked solely when its stomping and goring abilities are hindered or interrupted.
  


### Skink Tactics

Skinks generally keep their distance from the enemies, using their superior land, climb, and swim speeds to stay out of melee range. They generally work to debuff foes, and combo well with more powerful creatures who attack head on.

#### Jungle Toxins
Skinks rely on this ability for their own defense, as poisoned players will have a harder time hitting them with attacks or spotting them while they’re hidden. As such, they will try to poison as many enemies as possible.

#### Primeval Mask
This ability is vital for skinks initiating combat as they will never start a fight without the backup of more powerful creatures unless they can do so from an ambush.

#### Skink Warriors
These skinks have the fewest options for weaving in and out of combat, and so will rely on poisoning targets from a distance before engaging in melee. They will not close the gap with enemies who aren’t poisoned or in some way disabled.

#### Skink Behemoth Keeper
These skinks are usually found atop the howdas of larger creatures and will always make use of their Beast Bond ability to enhance their mount.

### Ceradon Loot
The valuable items looted from Ceradon will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a Ceradon. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Ceradon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Skink Loot
Because skinks are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skink Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.
