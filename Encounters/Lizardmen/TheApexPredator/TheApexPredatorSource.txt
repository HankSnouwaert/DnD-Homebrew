## The Apex Predator <br> (Player Level: 20)
In this encounter, the players face off against the legendary dread saurian known as the Dread Shredder in a temple plaza.
### Encounter Context
The only context needed is that the players have been pitted against the lizardmen and the Dread Shredder. The players may be in a jungle ruin within lizardman territory or defending a settlement from a lizardman attack. Either way, they are likely aware of the Dread Shredder’s presence and that it needs to be eliminated.

### Lead Up
The players can arrive from either the top or bottom ends of the map. If they know the Dread Shredder is coming down this walkway ahead of time, they may try to preemptively scale the walls or come from other sides. Note that this will tilt the battle in their favor. However, because of the Dread Shredder’s extremely high passive Perception, it is still unlikely all the players will be able to catch it in a surprise attack.
high passive Perception, it is still unlikely all the players will be able to catch it in a surprise attack.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** Because this walkway is outdoors, the lighting will depend on the time of day.
* **Walls & Columns.** These structures are made of stone and in varied states of crumbling disrepair, leaving their heights uneven. Some of the walls have enough cracks and handholds that they can be climbed by making a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Foliage.** The plants around the map provide light obscurement.



### Combat
The Dread Shredder will either be equipped with an artifact of your choice or a howdah with one weapon of your choice and a crew of 4 skink behemoth keepers. The artifact options are listed later in this document.

The Dread Shredder will fight using the same tactics it would use in most other encounters, which are also described later in this document. If the players are fighting it from atop the map’s pillars and walls, it won’t hesitate to topple these structures to reach them.


### Aftermath
The dread saurian will fight to the death trying to kill the players. If the players attempt to flee, the dread saurian will almost certainly pursue them, in which case you can use the rules for chases described in the DMG.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables the players can find from the dread saurian. Considering this encounter will likely occur near the end of a campaign, it may be fitting to reward the players with a magic item or loot from the Challenge 17+ treasure hoard table in the DMG.

#### XP Award: 90,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the dread saurian can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The Dread Shredder was defeated without any players being dropped to 0 hit points.
* **100% XP:** The Dread Shredder was defeated, but one or more players was dropped to 0 hit points and nearly killed.
* **50% XP:** The players severely wounded the Dread Shredder to the point where it went on a rampage but fled before slaying it.
* **10% XP:** The players fled with the Dread Shredder while it was still in good health and under the full control of the lizardmen.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. The harder variants assume there are more players, but they could also be used to create exceptionally deadly end-game encounters.

**Easier Encounter (Level 15-17).** Replace the Dread Shredder with a normal dread saurian. Change the XP Award to 25,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20 with 5 Players).** Replace the Dread Shredder with a normal dread saurian. Equip it with an artifact and a howdah with two weapons of your choice that’s crewed by 8 skink behemoth keepers. Change the XP award to 120,000 XP.

**Epic Encounter (Level 20 with 6 Players).** Equip the Dread Shredder with an artifact and a howdah with two weapons of your choice that’s crewed by 8 skink behemoth keepers. Change the XP award to 155,000 XP.

### Dread Saurian Artifacts

The dread saurian can be equipped with a magical artifact that grants it additional abilities and increases its CR by 2.

#### Spirit Eye

*A mystic crystal is embedded in the dread saurian, which allows it to call forth primal warriors from ages past.*

At the start of its turn, the dread saurian can summon three specters in unoccupied spaces within 90 feet of it. The specters act immediately after the dread saurian on the same initiative count and fight until they are destroyed. They disappear after 1 minute or when the dread saurian dies. The specters summoned with this ability have the following changes:
* They are not affected by Sunlight Sensitivity.
* They have a melee spell attack instead of Life Drain. The attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and targets one creature. On a hit, the attack deals 10 (3d6) force damage


#### Heart of Stone

*A large, eldritch stone is fused into the back of the dread saurian. The dread saurian can use the stone to draw the power of the earth into its body and become as unyielding as a mountain.*

At the end of the dread saurian's turn, if it has not moved on that turn and is standing on earth or stone, it gains a +3 bonus to AC, saving throws, and opposed checks. This ability can stack up to two times. The dread saurian loses all stacks if it moves or is forced to move.

While equipped with this artifact, the dread saurian's Primal Instinct ability is triggered only by it becoming charmed or frightened.



#### Mantle of the Blazing Dawn 

*Strange golden patterns are etched across the dread saurian’s scales. As the beast charges, the markings flare and burn with divine radiance.*

Claw attacks made by the dread saurian when using its Obliterating Charge ability deal an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage and 10 (3d6) radiant damage on hit.




\pagebreakNum

#### Primal Jaws

*The dread saurian’s teeth are etched with runes and gilded with rare metal to honor the most ancient of bestial gods. When the dread suarian crushes foes with its sacred jaws, it awakens a primal vigor in its allies.*

When the dread saurian uses its Crushing Jaws on a hostile creature, it and each ally within 100 feet of it gain 20 temporary hit points for the next minute. If the creature fails the saving throw against Crushing Jaws, they each gain 30 temporary hit points instead. If it fails by 10 or more, they each gain 40 temporary hit points instead.

#### Rebus of the Jungle

*Stange, magical, light-bending vines grow across the dread saurian and help mask its presence. These plants also help it to move through dense undergrowth undetected by its prey.*   

The dread saurian gets +11 to stealth checks and can move though plants without being slowed, taking damage, being grappled or restrained.

While dread saurian is lightly obscured, it is invisible to any creatures more then 10 feet away form it. If the dread saurian has a Howdah, the Howdah and the  Creatures inside of it gain this benefit as well

#### Figures of Dread

*The dread saurian wears a massive headdress lined with menacing statues, amplifying its already terrifying nature such that none can look upon it without experiencing mortal terror.*

The following ability replaces the dread saurian’s Frightful Presence:

 ***Dread Presence.*** Each creature of the dread saurian's choice within 120 feet that is aware of it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. All creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw unless they are within 5 feet of an ally. Creatures normally immune to being frightened can still be affected, but have advantage on their saves. While frightened, the creature can only use its actions to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or steel its resolve. A creature that uses its action to steel its resolve can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the dread saurian's Dread Presence for the next 24 hours.

### Howdahs

You can choose to equip a dread saurian with a small, armored fort on its back known as a howdah. This howdah is a magic object with 100 hit points and an AC 19. Up to 10 Medium or smaller creatures can ride in the howdah without squeezing. All creatures within the howdah count as being within 5 feet of each other. 

**Entering the Howdah.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the dread saurian is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the dread saurian succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah until the start of its next turn, and any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted. 

The dread saurian may then immediately make an opportunity attack against the creature. If the dread saurian fails, the creature enters the howdah.

**Melee Attacks Against Creatures Within The Howdah.** To make a melee attack against a target in the howdah while outside of it, a creature must be within 5 feet of the dread saurian, and if the creature isn’t Huge or larger, the attack must have a reach of at least 20 feet.

**Protective Effects** When creatures are in the howdah, they are protected by powerful wards. They have three-quarters cover against attacks and effects from outside of it and a +5 bonus to all saving throws, not just Dexterity saves. If a creature in the howdah is subjected to an effect from outside that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half damage if it fails.

**Being Knocked Prone** If the dread saurian is knocked prone, the howdah takes 30 bludgeoning damage.

**Teleporting.** If the dread saurian is teleported, the howdah is teleported with it. Creatures in the howdah may choose to teleport with the dread saurian.

**Destruction.** If the dread saurian dies, the howdah is destroyed. When the howdah is destroyed, creatures that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the dread saurian.






#### Howdah Weapons

The howdah has built-in weapons that can be fired by the creature's within. Each weapon can only be fired once per turn. For every giant bow or giant blowpipe you equip the howdah with, increase the dread saurian's CR by 1.

##### Ballista

When using a giant bow, it takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. The creature aiming the weapon chooses the target and must also be the one to fire it. When fired, the arrow flies in a straight line up to 480 feet in a direction of the user's choice before falling to the ground.

If the arrow would strike a target, the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if the arrow has flown 120 feet or more. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or destroyed, the bolt keeps flying and deals 11 (2d10) less damage if it hits another target. Otherwise, the arrow's flight ends early.


##### Giant Blowpipe

When using a giant blowpipe, it takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. The creature aiming the weapon must be the one to fire it. When fired, it does the following:

Darts rain down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot radius centered on the point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (5d4) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, and makes the saving throw at the end of its turn against the poison with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, but does not have disadvantage on the saving throw at the end of its turn against the poison.

 ### Dread Saurian Loot
The valuable items looted from dread saurians will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them and whatever sacred items they’ve been adorned with. Harvesting a dread saurian’s body can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. Looting their adornments will usually involve an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest its hide.

Players should be able to do both forms of harvesting at once using separate checks for most dread saurians. 

If a dread saurian is equipped with an artifact, you can make a second roll for adornment loot. Alternatively, the players may recover a functional magic item from the artifact.


#### Dread Saurian Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.

### Dread Saurian Tactics
Dread Saurians are extremely belligerent and consistently seek to attack the largest group of enemies to inflict the most damage possible. They rarely consider going after the weakest targets. Their belligerence is so extreme that dread saurians will usually fight to the death, rampaging to the very end.

#### Dread Saurian Shredder Tactics
The only real difference in tactics with a dread saurian shredder involves its legendary actions, which are used in the following circumstances:

* **Swat.** This is used when dread saurian has a creature in its mouth, and another creature is causing a large amount of damage that it wishes to be rid of.
* **Mangle.** If the dread saurian doesn't have any creature in its mouth and is attempting to catch fleeing prey, it will usually use this after using an obliterating charge.
* **Gnaw.** The dread saurian will use this action whenever possible, unless under the effects of a debilitating condition where it needs to use Tenacious Will.
* **Obliterating Charge.** The dread saurian uses this action to catch up with fleeing prey.

#### Dread Saurian Howdah Tactics
Dread saurians on their own are generally not a significant threat to high-level parties as their dimwitted tactics and basic attacks can usually be countered by the many options players have at those levels. However, a howdah allows dread saurians to be directed by intelligent creatures and should be filled with riders equipped with ranged attacks to create a more well-rounded threat.

The creatures in the howdah do not have to be tough, as the +5 to all saving throws, AC from cover, and damage reduction mean that the crew is well-defended as long as they stay within the structure. Their job should be to eliminate targets the dread saurian cannot reach.

#### Dread Saurian Artifact Tactics
Dread Saurian upgrades can allow it to present a higher-level and more complex challenge. Here are some basic tactics for several upgrades:
* **Spirit Eye.** This is similar to the howdah in that it compensates for the dread saurian’s weakness to ranged attacks and flying creatures. The summoned spirits can disrupt enemies the dread saurian can’t reach, and their intelligence allows them to do this in tactical ways that support the dread saurian.
* **Heart of Stone.** With this upgrade, it’s best to grab one target and chew it relentlessly, only moving if there’s no one left to attack. It works well in combination with a howdah.
* **Mantle of the Blazing Dawn** With this upgrade, the dread saurian should make an obliterating charge whenever it can hit three or more targets.
* **Jaws of the Savage** This upgrade works well in combination with a howdah or other minions.
* **Rebus of the Jungle** This upgrade allows the dread saurian to behave more like an ambush predator. When it’s not rampaging, the dread saurian’s strategy should be to lure targets into underbrush and darkness.
* **Figures of Dread** This upgrade does little to change the dread saurian’s tactics.
