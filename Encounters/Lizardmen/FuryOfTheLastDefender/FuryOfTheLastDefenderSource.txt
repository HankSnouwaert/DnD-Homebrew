## Fury of the Last Defender <br> (Player Level: 20)
In this encounter, the players are exploring an ancient ruined jungle city which, unbeknownst to them, is still being guarded by The Last Defender, who continues to watch over it with an elite group of saurus warriors.

### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players have some reason to explore the ruins of an ancient lizardmen city and challenge whatever lies within. They may be seeking lost treasures or something else vital to aiding them against a world-ending threat. Because The Last Defender makes for a challenging boss fight, this could be the final encounter of a dangerous adventure through the jungle ruins.

### Lead Up
The Last Defender will attempt to ambush the players as they enter the courtyard. He remains hidden at his starting location and will spring his attack as soon as the players come within range or notice him.

### Map Description
* **Jungle Terrain.** The jungle areas are lightly obscured, difficult terrain. Additionally, any trees can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check, and they are generally about 20 feet high. Any creature in a tree has half cover from ranged attacks.
* **Stone Structures.** The stone structures of the city's remains include walls and columns and can be climbed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.

### Running the Encounter
Once The Last Defender launches his attack from atop his carnosaur steed

#### The Saurus Warriors (Harder Encounter)
If you're running the harder version of this encounter, every round after the first round of combat, a saurus sacred spawn mounted on a horned one will arrive from one of the map entrances (marked with purple numbers) at random on initiative count 20. These sacred spawn have the Blessing of the Beast God and take their turn as soon as they arrive. NOTE: Should they roll for initiative?
#### Combat Tactics
For in-depth tactical tips on how to run The Last Defender and the saurus warriors, see the Encounter Reference Material later in this document.

### Aftermath
The Last Defender and his saurus allies will fight to the death defending the abandoned remains of the lizardmen city. If the players flee, they will pursue them to the border of the city, but no further.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables and new magic item descriptions found later in this document to determine what valuables The Last Defender and Grimlokk might leave behind. Considering this encounter is likely to be a major boss battle, it may be fitting to reward the players with a magic item or loot from the Challenge 17+ treasure hoard table in the DMG. This treasure might be what the players plunder from the city or something they find on the way to their main objective here.

#### XP Award: 75,000xp 
This encounter is very much an all or nothing battle with The Last Defender. This, combined with the fact that the players are likely max level, means there is little point in awarding more or less XP based on their performance in this encounter.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. The harder variant assumes there are more players, but it could also be used to create exceptionally deadly end-game encounters.

**Easier Encounter (Level 17-19).** Remove the Grimlokk and The Last Defender's legendary actions. Change the XP Award to 35,000 XP.

**Hard Encounter (Level 20 with 5-6 Players).** Add the saurus warrior reinforcements as described in The Saurus Warriors section. Change the XP award to 155,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Reawakening City:** The ruins the players are exploring are not just remnants of the past. Deep below, an ancient device is coming to life, threatening to reshape the world as the lizardmen once knew it. The Last Defender knows this and guards the surface from intruders. The players might need to delve deeper, uncovering ancient lizardmen technology and secrets. |
|  2  | **Echoes of War:** The ruins are in fact haunted by spirits perpetually engaged in the city's final battle from a bygone era. The Last Defender and his companions are among these combantants and see the players as invaders. The players could attempt to find a away to put these warring echos to rest for good. |
|  3  | **The Portal Nexus:** The ruins contain an ancient portal network, now dormant. The Last Defender and his elite are not just guards but custodians, ensuring no one activates these portals unintentionally. Reactivating the network could provide the players with vast new territories to explore but at the risk of opening paths to malevolent realms. |
|  4  |**The Forgotten God:** The ruined city was once the worship center of a lizardmen god now forgotten by most. This deity starts to communicate with the players, granting them visions or powers. They are tasked with either restoring the god's prominence or preventing its return, depending on the deity's nature and the players' inclinations. |

At the end of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage per carnosaur wound it has sustained. Carnosaur wounds can be healed if the creature regains 10 or more hit points or if a use of a healer's kit is expended on it.

###  The Defender & The Beast
While working together, The Last Defender and Grimlokk gain the following shared abilities. When using these abilities, treat them as a single CR 25 creature for the purposes of XP and encounter difficulty.

***Attuned to the Beast:*** When Grimlokk serves as The Last Defender's mount, The Last Defender can direct Grimlokk to take the Attack action once during each of The Last Defender's turns. If either Grimlokk or The Last Defender is reduced to 0 hit points, the other enters a Rampage state that lasts for one minute. While in this Rampage, they have advantage on attack rolls and deal an additional 11 (2d10) damage on successful hits.


#### Shared Legendary Actions
Grimlokk and The Last Defender possess a joint pool of 3 legendary actions when they are engaged in combat together, choosing from the options detailed below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time between both of them and only at the end of another creature's turn. They regain their expended legendary actions at the start of The Last Defender's turn. Should one of them fall, the other retains the ability to use these actions for the subsequent hour.

**Check.** Either Grimlokk or The Last Defender can perform a skill check that would ordinarily require an action.

**Movement.** Grimlokk or The Last Defender can move up to 30 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. Should Grimlokk or The Last Defender come within 5 feet of each other during this movement, The Last Defender can instantly mount Grimlokk, provided he has a movement speed of 5ft or more. Additionally, he can opt to dismount Grimlokk at any time during this movement.

**Claw.** Grimlokk makes a claw attack.

**Spear.** The Last Defender makes an attack with the Spear of Dread Visions. If the attack hits a creature, that creature is afflicted with a vision (described in the attack description).

**Tenacious Will.** If either Grimlokk or The Last Defender is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. This legendary action can be used while incapacitated.

**Deadly Onslaught. (Costs 2 Actions)** Both Grimlokk and The Last Defender launch a wild barrage of attacks. Every creature within 5 feet of either of them must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) slashing damage and is inflicted with a carnosaur wound (as described in Grimlokk's Bite attack). However, if a creature that fails the save is within 5 feet of both The Last Defender and Grimlokk, it sustains two wounds.

**Roar of Reckoning. (Costs 2 Actions)** Grimlokk and The Last Defender simultaneously emit powerful, divine roars in twin 120-foot cones. Any creature other than Grimlokk and The Last Defender in the area of either cone must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it loses concentration, is knocked prone, and is inflicted with a vision (as described in The Last Defender's Spear of Dread Visions attack). If a creature is in the area of both cones, it receives two visions on a failed save.

\columnbreak

### New Magic Items
The following are new lizardmen-themed magic items you can add to your adventures. They are both used by The Last Defender and if players defeat him, you could give them the opportunity to loot these items for themselves.


#### Spear of Dread Visions
*Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement), 4,000gp*

This spear was said to have been wielded by the Old Ones themselves. Those struck by it are inflicted with visions of doom that sap them of their will to carry on. The spear grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

**Returning Throw:** If the spear is thrown, it immediately flies back to your hand after the attack.

**Visionary Assault:** Once during your turn, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can inflict upon it a mystical vision. At the end of each of the affected creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) psychic damage for each vision it has been inflicted with.

A creature can have multiple visions simultaneously, and if it is suffering from three or more visions, it is blinded and has disadvantage on Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom saving throws and checks until the visions are removed.


Visions can be removed by the *remove curse* spell or any effect that can remove the blinded condition. A creature with visions or another creature within 5 feet can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check as an action, ending all visions on a success (NOTE: What does this check represent?).

A creature with Truesight cannot gain these <Br> visions, and all visions are removed if a creature <Br> gains Truesight. 

#### Hand of Gods
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement), 5000gp*

This divine relic appears to be a golden gauntlet with an extended arm piece. While wearing it, its user can create blazing balls of sunlight in the gauntlet's palm, which can then be blasted at enemies.

To attune to this item, you must affix it to your arm, either at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder. Upon doing so, the prosthetic magically transforms, replicating the appearance and function of the limb it's replacing. Once attached, it becomes an integral part of your body.

**Radiant Assault:** Once per turn, when you would normally make an unarmed strike, you can instead opt to make a ranged spell attack with a range of 100ft. using this item. For this attack, add your Wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the target suffers 4d10 radiant damage.

\pagebreakNum

### Last Defender <br> & Grimlokk Tactics

The Last Defender is a masterful warrior known for his strategic prowess. He often waits for the opportune moment to ambush foes and unleash his unique abilities. His loyal companion Grimlokk, follows his every command, creating potent synergy between their capabilities. 

**Wounds and Visions:** Both The Last Defender and Grimlokk have abilities that can stack damaging effects on enemies. These effects become highly debilitating at three stacks. In combat, prioritize stacking these effects.

**Sacred Wrath:** The Last Defender's Sacred Wrath reaction is reserved for adversaries with low Charisma, who will likely fail the saving throw.

**Blood Tracking:** This aids The Last Defender and Grimlokk in relentlessly pursuing wounded enemies. 

**Starting Turn:** Begin by stealthily approaching targets with The Last Defender mounted on Grimlokk. Once in position, Grimlokk should use its Frightful Presence and the defender should use his Sacred Aura. Focus the initial attacks on the most vulnerable enemy. If needed, leverage Grimlokk's ability to move with legendary actions to close distance. <Br><br>

**The Last Defender's Multiattack Sequence:**
* Initiate with a Tail Trip attack, followed by a Bite attack on the same target.
* Make the spear attack against the enemy with the most visions, even if the target is at a distance.
* For foes beyond Grimlokk's reach, such as flying enemies, use the Hand of Gods attack.



**Grimlokk's Multiattack Sequence:**
* Begin with a bite attack to grapple and restrain a target.
* Take advantage of the grappled foe by using a claw attack against it.
* After a bite and claw, it may make sense to carry a grappled target away from allies who could help it. Either way, Grimlokk should make a tail attack against another target if able.



**The Last Defender & Grimlokk's Legendary Actions:**
* **Movement:** The Last Defender can mount/dismount Grimlokk. Beyond closing this to close in on foes, they can also coordinate their movement to strategically split opponents. For example, Grimlokk could grapple a paladin with a protective aura and carry him away from the party, leaving them with The Last Defender.
* **Claw or Spear:** Choose which of these attacks to use based on which debuff stack (wounds or visions) is closer to 3 on the target.
* **Roar of Recking & Deadly Onslaught:** Use either of these abilities if you can affect four or more targets. These abilities are important ways to quickly stack wounds and visions on targets.

**Important Note:** Once either The Last Defender or Grimlokk falls in battle, the tactical strategies outlined above no longer apply.

\pagebreakNum

#### Blessing of the Beast God

*These lizardmen are marked with elaborate crests containing striking colors and possess an instinctive kinship with other beasts who possess the same primal instincts.*

If the saurus has a controlled mount with the Primal Instinct ability, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the saurus’s turns.

Additionally, while the saurus or the creature it is mounted on is rampaging, attacks of the saurus and the mount deal an additional 5 (1d10) damage on hit.

Finally, If the saurus is rampaging, it may choose not to move on its turn if it is mounted, even if this would prevent it from being able to attack.

### Saurus Tactics
Saurus are direct and aggressive in their combat tactics and will usually fight to the death regardless of how dire their circumstances seem. They usually charge headlong into their foes, though they aren’t stupid about how they approach and won’t stumble into obvious traps or allow themselves to easily be put in a disadvantageous position. Saurus instinctively understand how to flank and outmaneuver foes, and they can usually pick out soft targets that need to be taken down first. 

Saurus are slightly stronger than other creatures at their CR because their Primal Instinct ability provides an exploitable weakness. As a DM, it’s important to communicate to the players when a saurus enters into a rampage what effect this appears to have on it. This way, clever players can use it to their advantage. 

#### Saurus Warriors
&emsp;**Bite.** Use this by default unless there is a commander ordering it not to. Because using bite has a chance to cause the saurus to rampage but also get another bite as a bonus action, the commander may order them to start using this attack if they are below 50 hit points and, therefore, close to rampaging anyway. Saurus will always use this in place of a shield attack if they’re rampaging.

**Maul.** Use this every turn as it is the most powerful attack.

**Shield.** Use this if a commander orders them to not use bites to avoid going into a rampage. Saurus won’t use this attack if they’re rampaging.

### Grimlokk & <br>The Last Defender Loot
Valuable items looted from Grimlokk will generally come from whatever can be harvested from it. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a carnosaur. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Because saurus are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Last Defender are the remains of the equipment he was using or valuables he was carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. 

If you are combining Grimlokk and The Last Defender for a single epic boss battle, you can have them drop some truly valuable artifacts. These artifacts can be harvested or found the same way you find loot from The Last Defender. Though, you may change the checks to Intelligence (Religion) or Intelligence (Arcana) depending on the nature of the artifacts.

As an alternative to making any checks, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Grimlokk & <br>The Last Defender Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
