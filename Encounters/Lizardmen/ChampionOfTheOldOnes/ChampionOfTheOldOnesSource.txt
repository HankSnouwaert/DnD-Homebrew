> ___
>
> ***Ambusher.*** Grimlokk has advantage on attack rolls against any creature it has surprised.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of Grimlokk's choice that is within 120 feet of Grimlokk and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creatureâ€™s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to Grimlokk's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Jungle Stalker.*** Grimlokk has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage and may do so even if it is only lightly obscured. Additionally, Grimlokk can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** Grimlokk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Mangled Ligaments.*** If Grimlokk hits a creature that has three or more carnosaur wounds with a Bite or Claw attack, it mangles that creature. Until the mangled creature's carnosaur wounds are healed, its speed is halved, and it has disadvantage on attacks, checks, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Grimlokk can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite, one with its claws, and one with its tail. It can't make its tail attack against the same targets of its claw and bite attack.
>
> ***Bite.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 34 (4d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it sustains two carnosaur wounds and is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and Grimlokk can't bite another target. At the end of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage per carnosaur wound it has sustained. Carnosaur wounds can be healed if the creature regains 10 or more hit points or if a use of a healer's kit is expended on it. Alternatively, the wounded creature or another creature within 5 feet can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action, ending all carnosaur wounds on a success.
>
> ***Claws.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 17 (2d8 + 8) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it sustains a carnosaur wound as described in the Bite attack.
>
> ***Tail.*** _Melee Weapon Attack:_ +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Blood Tracking.*** Grimlokk learns the exact location of each creature with a carnosaur wound within 300 feet of it. It then may move up to 25 feet toward a creature with a carnosaur wound without provoking attacks of opportunity.

A creature with visions or another creature within 5 feet can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check as an action, ending all visions on a success (NOTE: What does this check represent?). <Br> A creature with Truesight cannot gain these visions, and all visions are removed if a creature gains Truesight.

#### Spear of Dread Visions
*Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement), 4,000gp*

This magical spear grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

**Returning Throw:** If the spear is thrown, it immediately flies back to your hand after the attack.

**Visionary Assault:** Once during your turn, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can inflict upon it a mystical vision. At the end of each of the affected creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) psychic damage for each vision it has been inflicted with.

A creature can have multiple visions simultaneously, and if it is suffering from three or more visions, it is blinded and has disadvantage on Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom saving throws and checks until the visions are removed.


Visions can be removed by the *remove curse* spell or any effect that can remove the blinded condition. A creature with visions or another creature within 5 feet can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check as an action, ending all visions on a success (NOTE: What does this check represent?).

A creature with Truesight cannot gain these visions, and all visions are removed if a creature gains Truesight. 

#### Hand of The Gods
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement), 5000gp*

This divine relic appears to be a golden gauntlet with an extended arm piece.

To attune to this item, you must affix it to your arm, either at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder. Upon doing so, the prosthetic magically transforms, replicating the appearance and function of the limb it's replacing. Once attached, it becomes an integral part of your body.

**Radiant Assault:** Once per turn, when you would normally make an unarmed strike, you can instead opt to make a ranged spell attack with a range of 100ft. using this item. For this attack, add your Wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the target suffers 4d10 radiant damage.

### The Defender & The Beast
If you wish to combine The Last Defender and Grimlokk in one encounter, you can grant them the following shared abilities. When using these abilities, you can treat them as a single CR 25 creature for the purposes of determining XP and encounter difficulty for players.

***Attuned to the Beast:*** When Grimlokk serves as The Last Defender's mount, The Last Defender can direct Grimlokk to take the Attack action once during each of The Last Defender's turns. If either Grimlokk or The Last Defender is reduced to 0 hit points, the other enters a Rampage state that lasts for one minute. While in this Rampage, they have advantage on attack rolls and deal an additional 11 (2d10) damage on successful hits.

#### Shared Legendary Actions
Grimlokk and The Ancient Defender jointly possess a pool of 3 legendary actions when they are engaged in the same combat. They can select from the options detailed below. Only one legendary action can be taken at the conclusion of another creature's turn. They regain their expended legendary actions at the commencement of The Ancient Defender's turn. Should one of them fall, the other retains the ability to use these actions for the subsequent hour.

**Check.** Either Grimlokk or The Ancient Defender can perform a skill check that would ordinarily necessitate an action.
Movement. Grimlokk or The Ancient Defender can move up to 30 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. Should Grimlokk or The Ancient Defender come within 5 feet of each other during this movement, The Ancient Defender can instantly mount Grimlokk , provided he has a movement speed of 5ft or more. Additionally, he can opt to dismount Grimlokk at any time during this movement.

**Claw.** Grimlokk makes a claw attack.

**Spear.** The Ancient Defender makes an attack with the Spear of Dread Visions. If the attack hits a creature, that creature is afflicted with a vision (described in the attack description).

**Tenacious Will.** If either Grimlokk or The Ancient Defender is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. This legendary action can be used while incapacitated.

**Deadly Onslaught. (Costs 2 Actions)** Both Grimlokk and The Ancient Defender launch a wild barrage of attacks. Every creature within 5 feet of either of them must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) slashing damage and is inflicted with a carnosaur wound (as described in Grimlokk's Bite attack). However, if a creature that fails the save is within 5 feet of both The Ancient Defender and Grimlokk, it sustains two wounds.

**Roar of Reckoning. (Costs 2 Actions)** Grimlokk and The Ancient Defender simultaneously emit powerful, divine roars in twin 120-foot cones. Any creature other than Grimlokk and The Ancient Defender in the area of either cone must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it loses concentration, is knocked prone, and is inflicted with a vision (as described in The Ancient Defender's Spear of Dread Visions attack). If a creature is in the area of both cones, it receives two visions on a failed save.
