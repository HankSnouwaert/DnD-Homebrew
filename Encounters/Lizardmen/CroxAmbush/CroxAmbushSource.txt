## The Crox Ambush <br> (Player Level: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players are traveling through a deep jungle swamp when they find themselves ambushed by a group of crox warriors supported by skinks.

### Encounter Context
The only context needed for this encounter is that the players are traveling through a dangerous jungle swamp. They may or may not know about the presence of the lizardmen before this encounter, and if they don’t, it can serve as a good introduction to how skinks and crox fight together.


### Lead Up
The players will enter from the bottom left of the map along the waterway, and their path will take them toward the larger body of water. Have the skinks and crox make Dexterity (Stealth) checks before the encounter to determine how well hidden they are. If they don't beat the Passive Perception of the players, the players will notice something lying in wait in the water as they near the clearing. 

If the players are stealthily enough to not be detected by the skinks, the skinks won't be aware of their presence until they move out into view of the larger body of water, at which point, the players can't remain hidden.

Once the players are in the water and in view of the lizardmen, the lizardmen will attack.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The lighting will depend on the time of day, though if it’s mid-day, much of the canopy away from the river will be dimly lit due to the heavy tree cover.
* **Water.** The murky water is an average of 5 feet deep and can heavily obscure fully submerged creatures
* **Jungle Vegetation.** The underbrush here provides light obscurement and makes the area rough terrain. The trees they surround reach an average of 30 feet high and can be climbed using a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to get a better view of the area.
* **Cliff Walls.** These cliff faces can be climbed using a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. 


### Combat
The players will face two sets of lizardmen, each a crox warrior backed up by two skink skirmishers. They will attempt to combine the element of surprise with their advantage in watery terrain to quickly overwhelm the players. The skinks will do their best to stick close to the crox, and all the lizardmen will stick to fighting in the water as much as possible. Though they will still fight on land if need be. Beyond this, they will fight using the general skink and crox tactics detailed later in this document.

* <font color="7D6608">**Yellow Section:** Jungle Vegetation</font>

### Aftermath
The skinks will call for a retreat if the fight is no longer going their way. Any who escape will rally a larger lizardmen force to crush the players. However, if the skinks are killed, any remaining crox will fight to the death.

If the players flee, the skinks may call for pursuit if they appear to have an overwhelming advantage. But it is more likely that they will rally a larger lizardmen forces before attempting to do so. If the skinks are killed, any remaining crox will pursue the players regardless of their condition.

#### Loot

You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables the players can find from the skinks and crox. If you wish to give them a bigger reward, you can adorn each crox with 2d4 pieces of jewelry worth 50 gp each.

#### XP Award: 13,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the lizardmen can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** All the lizardmen were defeated, and none were able to alert other lizardmen in the area.
* **100% XP:** Most of the lizardmen were defeated, but one or two skinks were able to escape and alert other lizardmen to the players’ presence.
* **50% XP:** The players slew roughly half the lizardmen but fled the remainder.
* **10% XP:** The players fled with more than half the lizardmen ambush force still intact.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter (Level 7-9).** Replace the skink skirmishers with skink warriors and the sacred crox warriors with normal crox warriors. Change the XP Award to 6,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 14-16).** Replace the skink skirmishers with skink behemoth keepers and the sacred crox warriors with crox storm warriors. Change the XP award to 18,000 XP.

**Hardest Encounter (Level 16-18).** Replace 3 of the skink skirmishers with skink behemoth keepers and the other with a skink chieftain. Replace one of the sacred crox warriors with a crox storm warrior and the other with a crox ancient. Change the XP award to 25,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Cult of the Swamp Serpent:** The ambush was orchestrated by a lizardmen cult that worships a powerful serpent deity that resides deep within the swamp. The adventurers must uncover the truth behind this cult, confront its leaders, and prevent them from summoning the serpent deity, which would unleash devastation on the region.|
|  2  | **The Sunken City:** Deep within the jungle swamp lies a sunken city that was once a thriving metropolis of an ancient civilization. The lizardmen patrol was sent to prevent anyone from discovering the city's riches and powerful artifacts. The adventurers must explore the sunken city while fending off the lizardmen and rival treasure hunters as they uncover the ancient relics. |
|  3  | **The Forbidden Portal:** Deep within the jungle swamp, the adventurers discover a portal to another plane of existence. The lizardmen patrol was guarding the portal, which they believe must remain sealed to prevent unimaginable horrors from entering their world. The adventurers must decide whether to explore the portal, risking untold dangers, or heed the warnings of the lizardmen.|
|  4  | **The Swamp Relic:** The jungle swamp is said to hold a powerful artifact that was lost centuries ago. The lizardmen patrol was searching for the artifact, believing it would grant them dominance over the swamp. The adventurers must race against the lizardmen and other treasure hunters to find the artifact, deciding whether to use its power or destroy it.|

> ##### The Rampaging Condition
> Many creatures in this document have abilities that cause them to enter a rampage. Rampages last for one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: <br>
> &#8226;  Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.<br>
> &#8226; The creature must take the Attack action on each of its turns, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see unless there are no creatures it can reach with an attack. <br>
> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>
> &#8226;  The creature can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

> ##### Optional  Reaction: Avenge Kindred
> If you're pairing your crox with skinks, you can give them the following reaction to help them work together:<br>
> ***Avenge Kindred.*** When a creature the crox can see deals damage to a skink within 30 feet of the crox that reduces its hit points to 0, the crox enters a rampage that lasts one minute and immediately moves up to its speed towards the creature and makes a melee weapon attack against it with advantage if it is within reach. 

## Creature Tactics

### Skink Tactics

Skinks generally keep their distance from the enemies, using their superior land, climb, and swim speeds to stay out of melee range. They generally work to debuff foes, and combo well with more powerful creatures who attack head on.

#### Jungle Toxins
Skinks rely on this ability for their own defense, as poisoned players will have a harder time hitting them with attacks or spotting them while they’re hidden. As such, they will try to poison as many enemies as possible.

#### Primeval Mask
This ability is vital for skinks initiating combat as they will never start a fight without the backup of more powerful creatures unless they can do so from an ambush.

#### Skink Warriors
These skinks have the fewest options for weaving in and out of combat, and so will rely on poisoning targets from a distance before engaging in melee. They will not close the gap with enemies who aren’t poisoned or in some way disabled.


\columnbreak

#### Skink Skirmisher
Because these skinks have blowguns and the ability to hide every turn using their vanish ability, they will never engage in melee combat unless cornered.

#### Skink Behemoth Keeper
These skinks are usually found atop the howdas of larger creatures and will always make use of their Beast Bond ability to enhance their mount.

#### Skink Chieftain
These skinks lead their kind in battle. They have a few noteworthy abilities:

##### Coordinating Javelin
Chieftains will use this ability to help other skinks quickly land a second javelin strike against a chosen target, thereby increasing the likelihood of it failing its saving throw against the Jungle Toxins.

##### Stalking Warrior
This ability allows groups of skinks to focus fire poisoned targets. The skinks can pop out from hiding, launch volleys of ranges attacks, and then disappear again, quickly whittling down poisoned players.


### Crox Tactics


Crox are inherently primal brutes, often attacking the nearest opponent out of pure instinct. These behemoths may fight using simple tactics and mindless aggression when on their own, but their true potential is unlocked when they are guided by smaller, more intelligent creatures, such as skinks.

In the hierarchy of Lizardmen, crox serve as formidable bodyguards and frontline soldiers. Although savage by nature, they display a surprising kinship with skinks. This unlikely alliance leads to the crox fiercely protecting skinks, even willing to risk their own lives to protect their allies unless instructed otherwise by a trusted skink companion.

The tactics described here are designed for use when crox are fighting alongside skinks but can be equally effective with other small, skirmishing humanoid units paired with crox.

Typically, the crox form the front line, advancing on the enemy. Directly behind them, the skinks utilize the crox's massive size as a protective wall. During their turn, the skinks maneuver through the crox to either engage any enemy units already in combat with the crox or, if the crox have yet to engage, to carry out ranged attacks.

Once their attacks are complete, the skinks retreat to safety behind the crox. They can also opt to use their bonus action to hide, leveraging the crox as cover if they possess the **Vanish** feature.

Should a crox go into a rampage, the skinks remain by its side until the battle appears lost or the crox can no longer provide sufficient cover.

#### Sacred Crox

Though sacred crox are more powerful than their ordinary kin and possess different types of weapons, they fight using the same tactics as typical crox. 

\pagebreakNum

#### Crox Storm Warriors
Under the guidance of a more intelligent strategist, one or more storm warriors will concentrate their efforts on a single target, attempting to inflict as many Static Wounds as possible. Given that these wounds vanish after a round of not being hit by one of the storm warriors, the skink handlers encourage the crox to take substantial risks to maintain the infliction of these wounds on high-priority targets.

Any skinks concealed behind the crox will simultaneously concentrate their attacks on the now weakened target, utilizing javelins and poison. The weakened state of the target makes it more susceptible to these attacks, increasing the likelihood of successful hits and, thus, effective poisoning.




#### Crox Ancients
Despite their lack of conventional intelligence, crox ancients possess an almost instinctual sense of strategy and warfare. They can implement rudimentary tactics and issue near-animalistic commands to other crox, although they operate more like a pack of beasts than a unit of soldiers.
While crox ancients demonstrate greater intellect than their counterparts, they are most effective when paired with skinks, who serve as their advisors.

For optimal strategic placement, the crox ancients should be situated in the center of their group's formation. This position maximizes the benefit of its Aura of Endurance trait and its Coordinated Maul attack.

However, when a crox ancient begins to rampage, if there are no skinks nearby to maintain order, all crox in the vicinity lose any semblance of strategic cohesion.

## Creature Loot

### Skink Loot
Because skinks are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skink Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Crox Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from crox are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Though crox don't often collect these items themselves, other lizardmen often adorn them with bones, jewelry, and ornaments of precious metal for ceremonial purposes. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
