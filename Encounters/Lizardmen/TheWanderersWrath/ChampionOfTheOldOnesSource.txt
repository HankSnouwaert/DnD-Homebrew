## Champion of <Br>The Old Ones <br> (Player Level: 13-15)
In this encounter, the players enter a shrine dedicated to the lizardmen gods where they can face off against the divine avatar known as The Wanderer.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have found a lizardmen temple and have some reason to explore it and challenge whatever lies within. The encounter must be willingly initiated by the players as they provoke the wrath of the lizardmen gods. The players may have an antagonistic view of the lizardmen gods and The Wanderer and may be trying to conquer this challenge so they can plunder the temple. Or, this encounter may be a divine test, and the players may be undertaking this challenge as a way to prove their worth to the gods.

### Lead Up
The players arrive up the steps from the bottom of the encounter map. They should have the opportunity to study the monuments and attempt to discern their function. Once they douse one of the sacred monument flames or do anything to damage or desecrate the shrine, The Wanderer will be summoned, and the battle will begin.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The shrine is an indoor location, but the sacred flames of the monuments keep it brightly lit.
* **Monuments to the Gods.** Each of these stone monuments is 5 feet high and topped with a brazier containing a divine flame. Each monument has glowing inscriptions in front of it that can be deciphered with a successful DC 16 Intelligence (Religion) check. A deciphered inscription reveals the following information:
* The lizardmen god the monument is dedicated to
* The fact that tampering with anything in the shrine or dousing any of the divine flames will issue a challenge to the gods, who will summon their champion.
* The blessing that this shrine will bestow upon the summoned champion in the form of a new Legendary Action (described later in this document)
* The fact that dousing this flame will prevent the champion from receiving the said blessing


### Dousing a Flame
Players who decipher the inscriptions of the monuments should learn that they can disable one of The Wanderer's abilities by dousing the flame associated with that ability. You can give them a general description of that monument's god and the ability it will bestow upon the summoned champion so the players can make an informed decision about which flame to douse.

### Combat
The Wanderer fights using the general tactics described in The Encounter Reference Material. However, in this encounter, The Wanderer has access to additional lair actions. If the players doused one of the sacred monument flames before starting the encounter, The Wanderer loses access to the lair action associated with that monument's god.

The Wanderer can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Wanderer regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

\pagebreakNum

&emsp;**God of Protection: Ward of Deterrence:** A spectral rune manifests within the lair, creating a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a designated point. This rune persists until the next initiative count 20. When a creature enters this area for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there, The Wanderer can force it to make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, until the end of its next turn, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and can only make one attack per turn.

**God of Beasts: Jurisdiction of the Beast:** A formidable spectral beast materializes within the lair, occupying an unoccupied 5-foot cube. This spectral entity remains until the next initiative count 20. Upon the beast's appearance, The Wanderer can choose any number of creatures within 5 feet of it to make a Charisma saving throw. Creatures take 16 (3d10) force damage on failed save and half as much on a success. If a creature within the lair casts a spell of 1st level or higher, the spectral beast can instantly teleport to a space within 5 feet of the spellcaster. The Wanderer can then force any number of creatures within 5 feet of the beast to make the saving throw against the beast's damage.

**God of Storms: Dizzying Whirlwind:** A powerful whirlwind arises within the lair, forming a 15-foot radius sphere centered on a chosen point. The Wanderer can select any number of creatures within the whirlwind's area, forcing them to make a Strength saving throw. Creatures that fail are pushed 15 feet away from the whirlwind's center and can't take reactions until the end of their next turn. Additionally, during their next turn, they must choose between taking a move, an action, or a bonus action â€” they cannot take more than one of these options.

### Aftermath
The Wanderer will fight to the death but will not pursue the players if they flee. If the players flee, The Wanderer will disappear from the shrine after 1 hour, and the shrine will return to the state it was in before the players entered. 

If the players manage to drop The Wanderer to 0 hit points, you may opt to have him dissolve into light as he is returned to wherever he came from rather than being slain outright. This would be especially appropriate if this encounter is meant to represent a trial presented by the gods rather than them summoning The Wanderer to protect the shrine from invaders. 

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables The Wanderer might leave behind. Considering this encounter is likely to be a major boss battle, it may be fitting to reward the players with a magic item or loot from the Challenge 11-16 treasure hoard table in the DMG. This treasure might be what the players plunder from the temple or what the gods offer them as a reward for besting the challenge they've undergone.

\columnbreak

#### XP Award: 18,000xp 

Because this encounter has a very binary condition for success (the players defeat The Wanderer or they don't), it makes sense to either award all of the XP or none of it. If you wish to reward or punish players for their tactics and decision-making, you can give them 50% more or less of their XP reward, depending on how well they handle the encounter.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 11-13).** Remove The Wanderer's lair actions. In this scenario, the gods don't offer any additional blessings, and it makes no difference which sacred flame is extinguished. Change the XP Award to 15,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Grant The Wanderer the Favor of the Old Ones enhancement (described later in this document.) Change the XP award to 62,000 XP.

### Mythic Battle:<Br> Favor of the Old Ones
For a mythic encounter with The Wanderer, increase his hit points to 600 HP and enhance his Primal Roar trait with the following effects. His Challenge Rating (CR) increases to 23.
Primal Roar Modification: The Wanderer's Primal Roar trait changes such that it triggers three different times as his hit points drop to 450, 300, and 150 rather than only triggering once. The damage bonus granted to allies from each roar can stack, and a single instance of damage to The Wanderer can trigger multiple roars.

Each time Primal Roar is triggered, a unique set of effects occurs. These effects persist until The Wanderer is reduced to 0 hit points or 10 minutes has passed.

#### 1st Roar (450 HP): The God of Beasts
The Wanderer's roar summons a **razorsaur** in an unoccupied space it can see within 300 feet, subject to the following conditions:
* The summoned razorsaur has an initiative count of 20 and benefits from the effects of the roar that called it forth, including having the rampaging condition.
* This razorsaur remains for 10 minutes or until either it or The Wanderer are reduced to 0 hit points.
* Each subsequent use of The Wanderer's Primal Roar will summon another razorsaur in the same manner.

#### 2nd Roar (300 HP): The God of Storms
The Wanderer's roar summons a tempest blows around The Wanderer (30 miles per hour) and moves with it, remaining centered on it. The tempest is up to 1 mile high with a diameter of 150 feet. The Wanderer can choose any number of creatures to be unaffected by the storm, but all other creatures suffer the following effects while in its area:
* The storm is difficult terrain for flying creatures.
* Ranged attacks that travel more than 30 feet through the storm automatically miss.
* On initiative count 20, every creature within the storm must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet toward its center.

#### 3rd Roar: The God of Protection
The Wanderer's roar creates a glowing 30-foot cube of shimmering magical protection centered on himself. He can choose any creatures within the area of the cube to be rendered immune to all forms of damage while they continue to be within it. The cube stays in one location and doesn't move with The Wanderer.

### The Wanderer Tactics 
The Wanderer excels in brutal melee combat. While formidable on his own, he becomes even more effective when supported by ranged creatures. These allies help compensate for his lack of long-range capabilities, and they work especially well together when the allies can benefit from The Wanderer's Hulking Protector feature.

The Wanderer possesses an innate knack for battle tactics, akin to an animal's hunting instincts, and he can expertly maneuver both himself and his minions to target the most vulnerable foes.

When selecting from his attack options, you can make the following considerations:

**Mighty Swing.** This allows The Wanderer to use his maul to decimate the densest clusters of enemies on the battlefield.

**Vice-like Jaws.** This is effective against skirmishers like rogues and monks or ranged attackers. It prevents them from escaping, and The Wanderer can even move a grappled target into a cluster of enemies, setting them up for his devastating Mighty Swing.

**Raking Claw.** This attack is most effective against targets with low AC, ensuring that both claws hit their mark.

**Tail Trip.** Targets with low Strength are especially susceptible to this move and make for ideal targets.

#### Primal Roar
Once The Wanderer's Primal Roar ability triggers, all tactical considerations are cast aside in favor of pure bloodshed. However, he retains the capacity to utilize his legendary actions in the most tactically advantageous ways possible.


#### Mythic Encounter
The Wanderer's mythic battle presents a formidable challenge for a player party, demanding significant counterplay strategies.

For The Wanderer, there are few decisions to make. The primary tactical consideration involves positioning the razorsaurs upon their arrival. It's important to note that the newly-summoned razorsaur, in their rampaging state, will hurl spikes at the closest target. Ideally, they should be positioned to target ranged or flying attackers, which The Wanderer struggles to counter.


\columnbreak


### The Wanderer Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Wanderer are the remains of the equipment he was using or valuables he was carrying. Though crox don't often collect these items themselves, other lizardmen often adorn them with bones, jewelry, and ornaments of precious metal for ceremonial purposes, and The Wanderer is decorated with the most sacred of these items. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Because a battle against The Wanderer will likely be a major turning point in the adventure, it will often be a good idea to include a treasure hoard of the appropriate level as loot in addition to what's listed here.

#### The Wanderer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
