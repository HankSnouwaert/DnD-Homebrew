## The Dark Forest Shrine <br> (Player Level: 16-18)
In this encounter, the players find a forest shrine dedicated to malevolent woodland spirits. The shrine's defenders ambush the players shortly before a huge manifestation of the spirits they worship attacks.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have traveled into the dark forest where the shrine is located and have a reason to destroy said shrine. They may have been sent on a mission to destroy it or may have stumbled upon it. Either way, it should be obvious that the shrine is sinister in nature.

### Lead Up
The ambushers will wait until the players enter the optimal location (shown on the map) before springing their attack. They will begin their attack earlier if they are spotted. If there already isn't at least a light snowfall when the players arrive, it will begin lightly snowing when the ambushers attack (but not enough to obscure vision).

### Map Description
* **Foliage.** The forest's foliage creates areas of difficult terrain that are lightly obscured. Additionally, the trees can be climbed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check and average around 20 feet high.
* **Stone Monuments.** The monuments have varying heights and can be climbed with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. 

### Running the Encounter
The ambushers will focus on buying time and whittling the players down as they await the arrival of the avatar of beasts they worship. The elemental will appear at the start of the third round of combat at any point of your choice, touching the edge of the map. It then immediately rolls for initiative and takes the Hide action (no action required). 

At this point, the snow will also begin coming down much harder, to the point where it lightly obscures the whole battlefield, thus allowing the ambushers and the elemental to hide anywhere.

#### Woodland Ambusher Tactics
Depending on the difficulty level you are using for the encounter, you could use woodland or wolfheart ambushers. The general combat tactics for both are described below.

**Initiating Combat.** As their name implies, ambushers always wait until they have the element of surprise and an environmental advantage before engaging in combat. They initiate their attack from a distance, preferably with rough terrain and land features they can use as cover between them and the players.

* <font color="Green">**Green Areas:** Forest Foliage </font>
* **A:** Start Location of Woodland Ambushers

<br>

&emsp;**Avoiding Melee Combat.** Ambushers avoid melee combat whenever possible, preferring to maintain a distance of at least 60 feet from their targets. This distance hinders most targets from engaging them in melee combat yet allows the ambusher to pursue them if they decide to flee. 

**Spreading Out.** Ambushers never form tight formations; they always spread out from each other, thereby forcing enemies to traverse a significant amount of difficult terrain to reach any single target.

**Retreating.** Ambushers are quick to flee if it's clear the fight is not going their way. If their foes manage to repeatedly thwart their bull's-eye damage bonus, or if they fail to execute a surprise attack on the first turn, they will retreat into dense foliage or other natural cover, aiming to ambush the party later when an opportunity arises. Their high survival skill allows them to easily track down their enemies for a subsequent ambush.

\pagebreakNum

#### Wolfheart Ambushers
Wolfheart ambushers follow the same tactics as regular ambushers, with two notable differences:

**Close Quarters Shooter.** Unlike regular ambushers, wolfheart ambushers are not as averse to being in melee range due to their Close Quarters Shooter ability. This means they are more willing to launch ambushes in environments where they can't initiate from as far away.

**Ambusher's Net.** The ambusher's net serves as an escape tool and a way to enable their bull's-eye ability. When a creature engages in melee combat with a wolfheart ambusher, the ambusher responds by throwing its net on the creature as a bonus action, then shoots at point-blank range. If unsuccessful, the wolfheart ambusher will distance itself from the target, continuing to shoot at it each turn.

#### Avatar of Beasts Tactics
Avatars of Beasts are ambush predators and experts at stealthily navigating woodland environments to attack from optimal hidden positions. Knocking enemies prone will be their primary tactic throughout the fight as it allows them to stack successive talon attacks on a single target more easily.

During this fight, the avatar of beasts will prioritize attacking whoever is closest to its shrine.

##### Special Abilities

&emsp;**Flock of Doom.** The avatar generally uses this ability at the start of the fight, ideally before it's even spotted by the players. The avatar will stay hidden for as long as possible while withering away the players with the flock. The avatar will only charge into combat if it manages to blind a vulnerable player it can reach, or one of the players spot it. While the flock is active during combat, the avatar will position it to hinder ranged attackers. 

**Amber Breath.** This ability is deployed when the avatar can hit three or more targets simultaneously. 

##### Attack Sequence

The elemental's primary targets are those blinded by its flock and any vulnerable prey it can reach. The target's distance and whether it's prone affects how the elemental will attack.<br><br>

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Available.** 
* The avatar uses Howl of the Great Beast.
* It then closes the distance and makes a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If finishes with a stomp attack.

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Not Available.** 
* The avatar uses its Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If it manages to knock the target prone, it will follow up with two stomp attacks; otherwise, it will make two talon attacks.

\columnbreak

**Targets Beyond 60ft.**
* The avatar dashes to its target.
* The avatar uses the Bestial Take Down bonus action to make a gore attack.
* The avatar stands back up.
Note, if the avatar lacks the remaining movement to stand back up, it will be unlikely to use Bestial Takedown and leave itself vulnerable.

**Targets Already Prone.**
* The avatar attacks with two talon attacks.
* If both attacks hit, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make another talon attack.
* If any of the attacks miss, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a stomp attack.

### Aftermath
The ambushers and the avatar of beasts will fight to the death before abandoning the shrine. If the players attempt to flee, they instinctively hunt after them, though they will pull back to the shrine if there is any reason to believe it's in danger.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables and new magic item descriptions found later in this document to determine what valuables ambushers and the avatar of beasts might leave behind. Considering the significance of the shrine, it may be fitting to reward the players with a magic item or loot from the Challenge 11-16+ treasure hoard table in the DMG. This treasure might be what the players plunder from the shrine or items adorning the avatar of beasts.

#### XP Award: 25,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ambushers and the elemental can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all their foes without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all their foes, but one or more of their party members were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to either destroy the shrine or slay the avatar of beasts but flee the remaining foes.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without slaying the avatar of beasts or destroying the shrine.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easiest Encounter (Level 8-9).** Instead of the avatar of beasts appearing after 3 rounds, a wolfheart ambusher appears. Change the XP Award to 8,000 XP.

**Easier Encounter (Level 12-14).** Replace the woodland ambushers with wolfheart ambushers. Instead of the avatar of beasts appearing after 3 rounds, a wolfheart ambusher appears. Change the XP award to 20,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 18-19).** Replace the woodland ambushers with wolfheart ambushers. Change the XP award to 35,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Winter's Grasp:** The heavy snowfall isn't natural but rather a prolonged curse by the shrine, slowly turning the region into a frozen wasteland. Players must uncover ancient rites or find sacred artifacts to reverse the effect before it's too late. |
|  2  | **Abducted Villagers:** The players discover that the ambushers have been abducting villagers and sacrificing them to strengthen the elemental. Rescuing any remaining captives and ensuring they get home safely becomes a priority.|
|  3  | **The Dark Druid:** A druid, disillusioned with humanity's treatment of nature, is behind the shrine's power and the elemental's wrath. Tracking them down and either confronting or redeeming them might be the key to pacifying the woods.|
|  4  |**The Forgotten Forest God:** Hidden scriptures or relics at the shrine hint at an old deity of nature, forgotten and angry. The players can embark on a quest to rediscover this deity, potentially appeasing or confronting it to restore balance. |

>
> ***Crashing Charge.*** If the avatar moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 11 (2d10) damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The creature makes the saving throw with disadvantage if the attack was made using its Bestial Take Down bonus action.
>
> ***One with the Wild.*** The avatar has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena and can do so when only lightly obscured. Additionally, the avatar can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them, and can move through trees as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 10 force damage if it ends its turn inside a tree.
>
> ***Primal Senses.*** The avatar has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on the checks in areas that are lightly obscured.
>
> ***Talons of the Forest.*** When the avatar makes an attack, it ignores half and three-quarters cover provided by foliage.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The avatar makes two attacks.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage.
>
> ***Savage Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) for each time this turn the target has already been hit with its Talon attack this turn.
>
> ***Pulverizing Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a prone creature, it cannot stand up until the end of the avatar's next turn unless it uses its action to succeed on a DC 20 Constitution check.
>
> ***Amber Breath (1/day).*** The avatar exhales amber light in a 60-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creatures gain no benefit from cover given by foliage for this saving throw.
>
> ***Flock of Doom.*** The avatar fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 100 feet of it with shadowy crows. The avatar can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by the crows. The sphere spreads around corners, and it lasts until the avatar uses the ability again, is more than 100 feet away from the area, or loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The sphere's area is difficult terrain, and creatures in it have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. At the end of each of the avatar's turns, each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 15 (6d4) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is surprised. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 8), it is blinded until the end of the avatar's next turn. On each of the avatar's turns, the avatar may move the crows 50 feet in any direction (no action required). Using this ability does not reveal the avatar if it is hidden from a creature.
> 
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Howl of the Great Beast (1/day).*** The avatar lets out a primeval howl. The avatar can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by it. Each affected creature within 120 feet of it that can hear it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes frightened of the avatar. The creature can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the avatar by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. At the end of its turn, the creature repeats the Wisdom save, ending the effect on it on a success.
>
> ***Bestial Take Down.*** The avatar makes one weapon attack. After the attack, the avatar falls prone. If it has 90 or fewer hit points, the attack is made with advantage.

### Avatar of Beasts Loot
Because these creatures are elementals, they don't have flesh and blood like mundane other creatures, and most of their body disintegrates when they die. Amidst the smokey ashes they leave behind, players may be able to salvage some bone or hide that remained corporeal or even some of their magical essence before it evaporates. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Avatar of Beasts Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Avatar of Beasts Loot Table
| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |

### Woodland Ambusher Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from woodland ambushers are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
