## The Dark Forest Shrine <br> (Player Level: 12-14)
In this encounter, the players find a forest shrine dedicated to malevolent woodland spirits. The shrine's defenders ambush the players shortly before a huge manifestation of the spirits they worship attacks.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have traveled into the dark forest where the shrine is located and have a reason to destroy said shrine. They may have been sent on a mission to destroy it or may have stumbled upon it. Either way, it should be obvious that the shrine is sinister in nature.

### Lead Up
The ambushers will wait until the players enter the optimal location (shown on the map) before springing their attack. They will begin their attack earlier if they are spotted. If there already isn't at least a light snowfall when the players arrive, it will begin lightly snowing when the ambushers attack (but not enough to obscure vision).

### Map Description
* **Foliage.** The forest's foliage creates areas of difficult terrain that are lightly obscured. Additionally, the trees can be climbed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check and average around 20 feet high.
* **Stone Monuments.** The monuments have varying heights and can be climbed with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. 

### Running the Encounter
The ambushers will focus on buying time and whittling the players down as they await the arrival of the bestial elemental they worship. The elemental will appear at the start of the third round of combat at any point of your choice, touching the edge of the map. It then immediately rolls for initiative and takes the Hide action (no action required). 

At this point, the snow will also begin coming down much harder, to the point where it lightly obscures the whole battlefield, thus allowing the ambushers and the elemental to hide anywhere.

#### Woodland Ambusher Tactics
Depending on the difficulty level you are using for the encounter, you could use woodland or wolfheart ambushers. The general combat tactics for both are described below.

**Initiating Combat.** As their name implies, ambushers always wait until they have the element of surprise and an environmental advantage before engaging in combat. They initiate their attack from a distance, preferably with rough terrain and land features they can use as cover between them and the players.

<br>

&emsp;**Avoiding Melee Combat.** Ambushers avoid melee combat whenever possible, preferring to maintain a distance of at least 60 feet from their targets. This distance hinders most targets from engaging them in melee combat yet allows the ambusher to pursue them if they decide to flee. 

**Spreading Out.** Ambushers never form tight formations; they always spread out from each other, thereby forcing enemies to traverse a significant amount of difficult terrain to reach any single target.

**Retreating.** Ambushers are quick to flee if it's clear the fight is not going their way. If their foes manage to repeatedly thwart their bull's-eye damage bonus, or if they fail to execute a surprise attack on the first turn, they will retreat into dense foliage or other natural cover, aiming to ambush the party later when an opportunity arises. Their high survival skill allows them to easily track down their enemies for a subsequent ambush.

#### Wolfheart Ambushers
Wolfheart ambushers follow the same tactics as regular ambushers, with two notable differences:

**Close Quarters Shooter.** Unlike regular ambushers, wolfheart ambushers are not as averse to being in melee range due to their Close Quarters Shooter ability. This means they are more willing to launch ambushes in environments where they can't initiate from as far away.

**Ambusher's Net.** The ambusher's net serves as an escape tool and a way to enable their bull's-eye ability. When a creature engages in melee combat with a wolfheart ambusher, the ambusher responds by throwing its net on the creature as a bonus action, then shoots at point-blank range. If unsuccessful, the wolfheart ambusher will distance itself from the target, continuing to shoot at it each turn.

#### Bestial Elemental Tactics
Bestial elementals are ambush predators and experts at stealthily navigating woodland environments to attack from optimal hidden positions. Knocking enemies prone will be their primary tactic throughout the fight as it allows them to stack successive talon attacks on a single target more easily.

During this fight, the bestial elemental will prioritize attacking whoever is closest to its shrine.

##### Special Abilities

&emsp;**Flock of Doom.** The elemental generally uses this ability at the start of the fight, ideally before it's even spotted by the players. The elemental will stay hidden for as long as possible while withering away the players with the flock. The elemental will only charge into combat if it manages to blind a vulnerable player it can reach, or one of the players spot it. While the flock is active during combat, the elemental will position it to hinder ranged attackers. 

**Amber Breath.** This ability is deployed when the elemental can hit three or more targets simultaneously. 

##### Attack Sequence

The elemental's primary targets are those blinded by its flock and any vulnerable prey it can reach. The target's distance and whether it's prone affects how the elemental will attack.<br><br>

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Available.** 
* The elemental uses Howl of the Great Beast.
* It then closes the distance and makes a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If finishes with a stomp attack.

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Not Available.** 
* The elemental uses its Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If it manages to knock the target prone, it will follow up with two stomp attacks; otherwise, it will make two talon attacks.

\columnbreak

**Targets Beyond 60ft.**
* The elemental dashes to its target.
* The elemental uses the Bestial Take Down bonus action to make a gore attack.
* The elemental stands back up.
Note, if the elemental lacks the remaining movement to stand back up, it will be unlikely to use Bestial Takedown and leave itself vulnerable.

**Targets Already Prone.**
* The elemental attacks with two talon attacks.
* If both attacks hit, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make another talon attack.
* If any of the attacks miss, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a stomp attack.

### Aftermath
Because the chamber offers no easy means of escape and The Grand Hierophant is desperate to unlock its secrets, he will likely fight to the death. If it is clear he can't win and he sees an opportunity to use his minions to cover his exit, he may attempt to escape so he can make another attempt at plumbing the chamber's secrets later. 

If the players flee, he won't pursue them himself but may send minions after them if it seems like they could be finished off. 

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables and new magic item descriptions found later in this document to determine what valuables The Grand Hierophant and his minions might leave behind. Considering this encounter is likely to be a major boss battle, it may be fitting to reward the players with a magic item or loot from the Challenge 17+ treasure hoard table in the DMG. This treasure might be what the players plunder from the chamber or something they being carried by The Hierophant.

#### XP Award: 35,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating The Grand Hierophant can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat The Grand Hierophant without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat The Grand Hierophant, but one or more of their party members were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players temporarily foil The Grand Hierophant's plans here, but he manages to escape.
* **10% XP:** The players flee.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 15-17).** Remove The Grand Hierophant's Wrath of the Desert Feature and replace the eternal guards with tomb guards. Change the XP Award to 35,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Give The Grand Hierophant a Casket of Souls, and replace the tomb guard reinforcements with eternal guards. Change the XP award to 60,000 XP.




### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Forbidden Knowledge:** Ancient texts speak of a ritual that can restore the Tomb Kingdoms to their full, living glory. The Grand Hierophant is on the verge of completing this ritual. The heroes must follow clues from various tombs, collecting artifacts and knowledge to stop him before he completes his grand design. |
|  2  | **Guardians of the Nexus:** The land's ley lines converge at an ancient, forgotten temple, and The Grand Hierophant plans to tap into this nexus. He intends to siphon its power, becoming a god-like being. To stop him, the heroes need to awaken the temple's ancient guardians and harness their unique abilities.|
|  3  | **Eclipse of Despair:** A rare celestial event is approaching, and The Grand Hierophant plans to harness its energy. If he succeeds, he will cast the world into an eternal twilight filled with undead horrors. The adventurers must journey through treacherous lands, gathering allies and learning of a way to prevent the Hierophant's dark ritual under the eclipse. |
|  4  |**The Pyramid Scheme:** Towering pyramids rise overnight near major cities. They drain life energy from nearby residents, channeling it to The Grand Hierophant to empower him in preparation for his ritual in the forgotten sanctum. Each pyramid presents a unique challenge, and all must be neutralized. |
