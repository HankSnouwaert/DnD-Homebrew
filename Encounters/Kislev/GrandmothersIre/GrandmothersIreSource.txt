## The Grandmother's Ire  <br> (Player Level: 16-18)
In this encounter, the players face off against The Crone Grandmother, who resides within her monstrous crone's hut atop a hill in a forest clearing. 
### Encounter Context
The players have arrived knowing they will be facing off against The Crone Grandmother. This will likely be the final encounter of an adventure with The Grandmother as the primary antagonist. As such, they may have had the opportunity to learn about her and the tools she has at her disposal before the fight.

### Lead Up
The players arrive from the forest entrance on the right side of the map. They can attempt to stealthily approach Grandmother in her hut by using the trees as cover, but she will be on the lookout for them.

### Map Description
* **Stone Pedestals.** These objects provide three-quarters cover.
* **Mundane Foliage.** The normal forest plant growth is difficult terrain. 
* **Magical Sharp Bramble and Branches.** These supernatural plants create areas of difficult terrain. When a creature moves into or within an area with these plants, it takes 2d4 (5) piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels unless it has a trait such as Woodland Stalker or One With the Wild (NOTE: Where are these abilities from?).

### Running the Encounter
Below are general tactics for how to most effectively use The Crone Grandmother in combat against the players. Note, in the default difficulty for this encounter, The Crone Grandmother does NOT have access to her Ancient Widow Form.

#### Grandmother's Abilities

&emsp;**Malediction of Ruin:** This curse ensures the crone's adversaries will slowly wither away, losing their effectiveness over time before finally perishing. Assuming she is able to utilize it effectively, she will fight defensively and use attrition to wear her enemies down.

**Draw from the Earth:** The crone aims to disseminate the bewitched ground across the battlefield, positioning them at intervals within 60 feet of each other. Her focus is on keeping adversaries away from these grounds, thus granting her the stamina to outlast her foes.

#### Concentration Spells & Their Priority
&emsp;**Impending Doom:** This spell accelerates the effects of Malediction of Ruin and should target characters with poor Charisma saves.

* <font color="Purple">**H** Crone's Hut </font>
* **C:** The Crone Grandmother

<br>

&emsp;**Bestial Spirit:** The summoned spirit should be positioned atop foes standing on the bewitched ground, compelling them to relocate or suffer its damage.

**Withering Resolve:** This spell accelerates the effects of Malediction of Ruinand should target characters with poor Wisdom saves. If the crone can maintain concentration on two spells—by using a crone's sled or crone's hut—she will use this spell twice on the same target.

**Summon Flock:** The attacks from this spell gain potency from the crone's Spirit's Wrath trait, and she uses them to drive enemies off her bewitched terrain.

**Mindrazors:** This spell excels when the crone has weapon-wielding allies. If so, it takes precedence; otherwise, it's of limited value.

\pagebreakNum

#### Non-Concentration Spells & Their Casting Priority

&emsp;**Amber Spear:** This spell is best used when it can affect three or more targets (or two targets with low Dexterity saves).

**Eldritch Blast:** Leveraging her Spirit's Wrath trait, the crone uses this spell to push foes away from her bewitched ground.

**Crippling Pain:** This spell is ideally cast upon agile players, such as monks or rogues.

#### Ancient Widow Form Tactics <br> (Not In Default Difficulty)
The crone retains the same combat priorities as her standard form. Her overarching objective remains to prolong battles, allowing her Malediction of Ruin to erode her adversaries.

**Cursed Metal Bite:** This attack is reserved for the most vulnerable foes. The crone uses it on the player whose ability score has suffered the greatest reduction.

**Legendary Claw Attacks:** Her legendary actions are primarily employed to unleash claw strikes on the most wounded enemy.

**Countering Melee Denial:** If opponents are staying out of her melee range, the crone retaliates with her Bewitched Bolt attacks. Furthermore, she utilizes her legendary actions to employ the devastating Grinding Teeth ability to damage and knock foes prone, giving her a chance to close in on them.

### Crone's Hut Tactics
The crone's hut is created by and loyal to the crones and dutifully carries out any command they give it. Its primary function is safeguarding a crone's magical items or the crone herself. When occupied by a crone, the hut transforms into a mobile fortress, offering protection and mobility.
Despite its formidable presence, the hut tends to avoid direct confrontations with creatures that have high Strength and Athletics scores. The risk lies in these foes being able to break inside the hut and either harm the crone within or inflict damage on the hut from the inside out. Instead, the hut prioritizes targeting those with less Strength.

#### Hut Combat Tactics
The hut prioritizes attacking two creatures within 30 feet of each other. This tactic allows it to utilize its pinning claw attacks without needing to move and allows it to grapple two adversaries simultaneously.

If the hut begins its turn with a melee-focused enemy grappled, it will use an attack to punt the enemy away to maintain distance.

#### Special Expel Combos

&emsp;**Punt and Expel Combo:** If the hut has an enemy grappled, it can punt that creature and then swiftly expel another creature from inside itself 
toward the enemy it just punted.

**Expel, Claw, Punt Combo:** If the hut doesn't have any adversaries grappled, it can approach an expelled creature, lash out with a claw attack, and subsequently punt the creature away.

\columnbreak

### Aftermath
Depending on the nature of your adventure, if the Grandmother is losing the fight, she may attempt to flee, surrender, or fight to the death. If the players flee and she still has access to her hut, she will likely pursue them. 

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables The Crone Grandmother and her hut leave behind if they're looted. Considering this encounter is likely to be a major boss battle at the end of an adventure, it may be fitting to reward the players with a magic item or loot from the Challenge 17+ treasure hoard table in the DMG. This treasure might be what the players plunder from the hut or something being carried by The Crone Grandmother. If you're running this encounter at a lower difficulty, change which loot table you're using accordingly.

#### XP Award: 30,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the crones can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the crone without taking much damage or expending many resources, and none of the players drop to 0 hit points.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the crone, but one or more of their party members was dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to destroy the crone's hut but then flee the crone.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating the crone or destroying her hut.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easiest Encounter (Level 10-12).** Remove the Crone's Hut from the encounter. Change the XP award to 11,000 XP.

**Easier Encounter (Level 13-15).** Remove the Crone's Hut from the encounter, but give The Crone Grandmother access to her Ancient Widow form. Change the XP award to 20,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Give The Crone Grandmother access to her Ancient Widow form. Change the XP award to 50,000 XP.

> ***Draw from the Earth.*** When the crone casts a spell of 1st level or higher, she may cause a 10-foot square of ground centered on herself to become bewitched for one minute. She can have up to three different areas bewitched at one time. At the start of the crone's turn, she or a creature she can see within 30 feet of her regains 10 hit points for each bewitched area within 60 feet of her that does not have a hostile creature occupying it. A *dispel magic* spell or similar magic will end the bewitchment on any given area.
>
> ***Forest Camouflage.*** The crone has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forest terrain.
>
> ***Malediction of Ruin (1/Day).*** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the crone names up to six creatures, cursing each of them for one minute or until the crone dies. When a creature cursed this way starts its turn within 120 feet of the crone, it must make a DC 18 saving throw; on failure, one of its ability scores is reduced by 1d4 until the curse ends. The target dies if this reduces its score to 0. The saving throw type and the ability score that is reduced is the creature's highest ability score other than Constitution. If two or more ability scores are tied for the highest value, the crone chooses one. A *remove curse* spell cannot remove the curse from a creature unless cast at a 6th level or higher; if it is cast at a lower level, it instead allows the creature to automatically succeed on its next saving throw against the curse.
>
> ***Spirits' Wrath.*** When the crone hits with a spell attack, she adds her Wisdom modifier to the damage dealt on a hit (5), and if the target is a creature, she can push it up to 10 feet away from her in a straight line.
>
> ***Survivor (30 HP, 1/Day).*** When the crone's hit points drop to half or less, for the next minute, she gains advantage on all saving throws and also gains 25 temporary hit points at the start of each of her turns.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The crone can make two Quarterstaff attacks or cast two cantrips.
>
> ***Quarterstaff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, or 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The crone casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Wisdom as her spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks):
>
> **At will:** druidcraft, *eldritch blast (three attacks)*, guidance
>
> **2/Day:** *amber spear** (4th level), *augury*, *crippling pain** (4th level), *summon flock** (5th level), *withering resolve**
>
> **1/Day:** *bestial spirit**, *impending doom**, *scrying*, *mindrazors**<br><br>
> **New Spells Found Later In Document*
> ### Legendary Actions
>
> The crone can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The crone regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.
> 
> **Blast.** The crone casts *eldritch blast*, making only one attack.
>
> **Check.** The crone makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Teleport.** The crone teleports herself to any other spot within 15 feet. She arrives at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place she can see, one she can visualize, or one she can describe by stating distance and direction. If she would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, the ability fails to teleport her.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If the crone is suffering from an effect that allows her to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of her next turn, she may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. She can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Spell Casting (Costs 3 Actions).** The crone casts a spell.

### Form of the Ancient Widow
When the Crone Grandmother would drop to 0 hit points or die, instead, her body begins twisting, twitching, and contorting as she becomes possessed by the Ancient Widow. The Crone Grandmother instantly changes into her Ancient Widow form in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of where her first form disappeared. Her initiative count doesn't change. 

When she has access to this ability, both her forms combined are treated as a CR 18 creature.

Each other creature within 120 feet of the widow must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (3d6) thunder damage and falls prone.

> ***Bound.*** The hut is magically bound to a creature. As long as the hut and the creature are on the same plane of existence, the creature can telepathically call the hut to it, and the hut knows the distance and direction of the creature. If a creature inside the hut casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to have the hut maintain concentration on the spell in its stead. The hut doesn't make concentration saving throws unless the damage that would force the save is from a critical hit.
>
> ***Extradimensional Walls.*** Creatures can't teleport into the hut unless it allows them to. Additionally, creatures with incorporeal movement or similar abilities can't move through its walls. The walls also extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The hut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
>
> ***Interior.*** A Large or smaller creature can spend all its movement to enter inside the hut or leave it, or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the hut is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter. If the hut succeeds, the creature can't enter. Any movement it used to try to enter is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. 
> 
> The interior is a 15-foot-square space. While a creature is inside the hut, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the hut. Any attack that hits the hut from the inside is a critical hit.
>
> ***Sure-Footed.*** The hut has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone or move it against its will.
>
> ***Warded Home.*** The hut and creatures inside it have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects originating from outside the hut. Additionally, creatures in the hut are shielded against divination magic, as though protected by a *nondetection* spell.
>
> ***Woodland Stalker.*** The hut has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage. Additionally, the hut can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The hut makes two *Pinning Claw* attacks and uses *Expel*. It can replace one of its *Pinning Claw* with a *Punt* attack as long it is not grappling two or more creatures.
>
> ***Pinning Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not inside the hut. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled. The hut has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Punt.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not inside the hut or grappled by it. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away. It has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is prone. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 11), it is pushed 40 feet away instead.
>
> ***Expel.*** The hut spins and attempts to force a number of creatures of its choice inside it to leave. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be thrown anywhere between 20 to 40 feet away (the hut's choice). If the thrown target would hit another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be hit, taking 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage and becoming prone. On a successful save, the creature dodges and takes no damage.

- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.

- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V

___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.

- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric Warlock, Wizard

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn.

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

### Crone Grandmother Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Crone Grandmother comes in the form of items she wears <Br> or carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

If the players are looting her hut for materials that were part of its construction, they could use Intelligence checks with the appropriate tools such as Carpenter's Tools or Woodcarver's Tools.

#### Crone Grandmother Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
