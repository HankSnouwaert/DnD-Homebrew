## The Crone's Quarrel  <br> (Player Level: 7-9)
In this encounter, the players stumble upon a trio of crones having a three-way argument and ask the players to pick which one of them is right. If the players choose one, the other two team up to attack the players and the crone they picked.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have traveled into a forest where the crones live but doesn't require they have any prior knowledge of the crones. It should be made clear that the crones aren't hags but humans, so the players don't feel compelled to attack them on sight.

### Lead Up
The crones are squabbling among themselves when the players appear. If they spot the players and the players aren't hostile, they will ask them to settle their argument by picking which one is right. The nature of the argument can vary depending on your campaign, but below are some suggestions:

1. The crones ask the players which lore of magic they believe is more powerful: Beasts, Death, or Shadow.
2. The crones ask which of them is the most beautiful.
3. The crones prepare to make an offering to the spirits of the forest, and they ask the party which is a more valuable item to use as an offering: Masterfully Crafted Bear Totem (Crone of Beasts), Demon Skull (Crone of Death) or a Pickled Witch Eye (Crone of Shadow). 
4. The crones have found a young girl (use commoner stat block) who they believe has the potential to become a powerful crone when she grows up. She is to choose one of the crones to be her mentor but cannot make up her mind, so she asks the party to choose for her.

When they side with one of the crones, the other two will become furious and ally together to attack the players and the other crone they picked. The crone the players sided with will aid them in the battle against the other crone. 

If the party ends up attacking the crones before they get a chance to converse with them, all three of the crones will attack the players together.


### Map Description
* **Foliage.** The forest's foliage creates areas of difficult terrain that are lightly obscured. Additionally, the trees can be climbed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check and average around 20 feet high.
* **Stacked Stones.** These stones can be climbed with a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. 
* **Rocks.** The rocks create areas that are difficult terrain, even for the sleds.
* **Sacred Trees.** These trees are 30 feet high and can be climbed like any other tree.

### Running the Encounter
The crones will fight using the general tactics described below. The crone allied with the players may give them warnings and tips for how best to deal with the spells the enemy crones are using during the fight. If the allied crone has support spells, she will cast them on the players and instruct them on how to best utilize their benefits.

#### Crone's Sled
While riding her sled, the crone employs hit-and-run strategies, utilizing her harts to ram into vulnerable targets.

The sled's Hexed Cauldron ability allows it to maintain concentration on a spell for the crone. This enables her to maintain two spells that require concentration at once. Typically, the crone assigns her most powerful spell to her sled as it retains concentration unless destroyed.

\pagebreakNum



#### Ancient Widow Form <br> (Harder Encounter Only)
Crone mothers transform into Ancient Widows when reduced to half health or less, enhancing their melee combat abilities. Despite this transformation, they do not become full-fledged frontline fighters and shouldn't be recklessly thrown into melee combat.


#### Crones of Shadow
More than any other type of crone, crones of shadow depend on their minions to be effective.

**Shadow Paths.** The crone will only use this ability to leave her sled if the sled becomes immobilized. The minion she swaps places with will be charged with restoring the sled's mobility. Once mobile again, the crone will swap back to reassume her position on the sled.

**Harrowing Coil .** Deploy Harrowing Coil on agile skirmishers such as rogues or monks.


##### Spell-Casting Hierarchy
&emsp;**Pit of Shadows.** Prioritize casting this spell on two or more targets with below-average Dexterity.

**Withering Resolve or Penumbral Pendulum.** Opt for penumbral pendulum if it can hit two or more targets or an immobilized target that will be struck again by the pendulum on the subsequent turn.
Alternatively, cast withering resolve on the target with the lowest Wisdom saving throw. Follow up with a charge using the crone's harts to exploit the attacks now made with advantage.

**Mystifying Miasma.** Cast when two or more targets can be hit, with one of them being under the effects of Harrowing Coil, so the conjured shadows inflict extra damage to the cursed creature.

**Shroud of Dusk or Unseen Lurker.** Use Shroud of Dusk when it can hit two or more targets. Unseen Lurker serves as an escape tool or an alternative attack facilitator for the crone. It's particularly effective when used in the crone's Ancient Widow Form to hide her actions or position.

#### Crones of Death
Crones adept in this lore of magic typically reserve their more potent spells for later combat stages.

**Life Leech Trait.** Crones start off with their lower-level spells to ramp up the bonus from this trait. They will then leverage their increased power to maximize their most powerful spells.

**Inversus Curse.** This curse should target a creature with low Charisma and Wisdom, who will then become a prime target for the crone's single-target spells.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Aspect of Dread.** This is a potent opening spell forcing multiple targets to make saving throws, thereby fueling the Life Leech trait. Beware that this spell can also affect allies.

**Impending Doom.** This is best used against a target marked with the Inversus curse. The crone can then follow this up with an assault by her harts and sled to take advantage of its poor saving throws.

\columnbreak





&emsp;**Spirit Leech.** Use this spell against creatures maked with the Inversus curse target before the crone's hit points drop to half so the temporary hit points gained don't cancel out any she will get from her Survivor or Ancient Widow trait.

**Crippling Pain.** Cast this on either the Inversus-cursed target or a creature encased in ice by the Freezing Charge ability of the harts.

**Horrifying Laughter.** Cast upon the Inversus-cursed target once the Life Leech trait has enhanced the crone's saving throws by +2.


#### Crones of Beasts
Because many of these crones' spells have a duration of an hour, and they have ways to maintain several of them at once, crones of beasts can be significantly more dangerous if they have time to prepare for a fight. 

**Wild Heart Trait.** This trait, when coupled with the crone riding on a sled, enables her to maintain concentration on three spells simultaneously, with the harts being prime targets for her spells. 

**Craven Scent Curse.** This curse is best targeted at frontline fighters.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Impenetrable Pelt.** The crone casts this defensive spell on herself to bolster her survivability.

**Bestial Spirit.** The summoned spirit should be positioned next to melee fighters possessing low Dexterity or targets slow enough that they can't outrun the Bestial Spirit.

**Wild Surge.** This spell works well with the Wild Heart trait and should target the crone's most formidable minion or herself while she is in Ancient Widow Form and has lost concentration on Impenetrable Pelt.

**Amber Spear.** This spell is particularly effective when it can hit three targets simultaneously (or at least two targets with low Dexterity).

**Summon Flock.** This spell is generally a lower priority among the crone's concentration spells. It's mostly useful when the crone doesn't have access to Impenetrable Pelt or she's scouting for enemies within her forest domain. The spell inflicts minimal damage, and its primary utility lies in disrupting the concentration of opposing spell casters.


### Aftermath
Depending on the nature of your campaign or setting, the crones may not see this as a fight to the death. It might be expected that the winner will revive the losers after the fight is done, in which case all the crones will fight until they can no longer. If the players and their crone ally lose the fight and are all reduced to 0 hit points or even killed, the enemy crones may revive them, gloat over their victory, and then send them on their way.

If the players flee, the remaining crones may chase after them on their sleds to punish them for their choices. 

If the players win the fight and their ally survives, the crone may reward them with valuables or her services or may offer them follow-up jobs that could lead to further adventures.

\pagebreakNum



#### Loot
You can use the loot tables and new magic item descriptions found later in this document to determine what valuables the crones leave behind if they're looted. If the ally crone survives, she may ask the players not to loot the other crones if she plans on reviving them. Instead, she may offer them a reward of her own. This could include a spell scroll of one of her once-per-day spells (the players can choose which they'd like) along with 2d6 100gp Rare Crone items (found in the loot guide later in the document.)

#### XP Award: 7,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the crones can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the enemy crones without taking much damage or expending many resources, and the allied crone never drops to 0 hit points.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all their foes, but one or more of their party members (or the allied crone) were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to defeat one crone but flee the remaining one.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating any of the crones.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 4).** Replace the crones with apprentice crones, replace the crone's harts with elks, and replace the crone's sleds with wagons that have the Winter Thicket Runner ability. Change the items the allied crone rewards the players with to 2d4 50gp Rare Crone Items. Change the XP award to 1,500 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 11-13).** Replace the crones with crone mothers. Change the items the allied crone rewards the players with to 5d8 200gp Rare Crone Items. Change the XP award to 15,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Forest's Plight:** The disagreement was about the best way to heal the dying forest. By choosing a side, the players have chosen a method. They must now assist the crone in her ritual, which could involve gathering rare ingredients, appeasing spirits, or breaking ancient curses. |
|  2  | **Guardians of Old:** Each crone was a guardian of a specific region of the forest. With the balance disrupted, malevolent creatures rise. Players must restore balance, either by mediating a truce or finding new guardians.|
|  3  | **Mystical Ingredients:** To strengthen the favored crone's magic against her sisters, the players are sent on a quest to collect rare ingredients, but each comes with its own perils.|
|  4  |**The Crone's Champion:** Impressed by their decision-making, the sided-with crone proposes a trial. If the players succeed, they become her champions who she endows with magical boons in return for their service. |

> ##### **Trait:**
> ***Life Leech.*** Whenever a non-undead, non-construct creature fails a saving throw against or is hit by a spell attack from one of the crone's spells of 1st level or higher, the crone gets a +1 to her spell save DC and spell attack rolls for the next minute. She can only gain this bonus once per casting of a spell, and this bonus can stack up to 3 times (+3). <br><br>
> 
> ##### **Crone's Curse:**
> ***Mortality's Grip (1/Day)*** The crone places a curse on a creature she can see within 90 feet, causing it to be overwhelmed by frailty.

> ##### **Crone's Curse:**
> ***Harrowing Coil (1/Day).*** The crone places a curse on a creature she can see within 90 feet, causing dark spirits to lurk in the shadows around the cursed creature. Until the curse ends, the creature treats dim light and darkness as difficult terrain. When the creature moves into or within an area of dim light or darkness, it takes 1d8 psychic damage for every 5 feet it travels. The curse ends once the crone dies, curses another creature, or ends it as an action.

>
> ***Hexed Cauldron.*** When a creature riding the sled casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to have the sled maintain concentration on the spell in its stead. The sled only loses concentration if it is destroyed, if it starts concentrating on a new spell, or if the spell-casting creature is either dead or moves more than 60 feet from the sled.
>
> ***Trample.*** The chariot and its steeds can move through the space of a prone hostile creature without using additional movement if that creature is Medium-sized or smaller. If the chariot or its steeds end their turn within the creature's space, the creature becomes restrained. While restrained this way, the affected creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 12 Strength check to try to free it. On a success, the restrained creature is moved to an unoccupied space of its choosing within 5 feet of the chariot and is no longer restrained.
>
> ***Winter Thicket Runner.*** The sled and its steeds are unaffected by non-magical, difficult terrain. Additionally, they can traverse through plants and ice without being slowed, grappled, restrained, knocked prone, or taking damage from thorny, spiky, or other hazardous plant features.
>
>
> ### Steed Actions
>
> ***Freezing Charge.*** When a steed moves at least 20 feet in a straight line, it can then make a melee weapon attack against each creature it's facing within 5 feet. On a hit, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) cold damage. If this attack knocks a target prone, ice forms around the target, restraining it for 1 minute. The restrained creature, or another creature within its reach, can use an action to break the ice and end the restrained condition.

### Woodland Crone Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from woodland crones come in the form of items they wear or carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Woodland Crone Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
