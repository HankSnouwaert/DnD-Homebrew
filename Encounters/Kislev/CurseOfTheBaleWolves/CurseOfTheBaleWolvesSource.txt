## Curse of the Bale Wolves  <br> (Player Level: 10-11)
In this encounter, the players come across a woodland trading post recently ravaged by a bale wolf dark blood who has transformed the former occupants into bale wolves via its cursed bite. 

### Encounter Context
The players may have been asked to visit this trading post or simply come across it during their travels. The players don't need to have any knowledge of bale wolves, though they have likely heard tales of them from folks living within the area.

### Lead Up
The trading post lies at the edge of an ancient forest. When the players approach, they will see the front door has been smashed in, and there are signs of violence. A DC 15 Wisdom Survival check done near the entrance will reveal there was a fight between the inhabitants of the trading post and a large beast of unnatural origin and that this struggle occurred several hours ago. 

The bale wolf dark blood that carried out this attack and the two former occupants who have been cursed into bale wolves lie within the trading post, waiting to ambush the players when they enter.
### Map Description
* **The Trading Post Walls.** The building is a wooden structure with a 10-foot high interior.
* **The Trading Post Doors.** Some of the doors inside are still functional and have an AC 15 and 25 hit points. The doorways are small enough that Large creatures must squeeze to move through them. 
* **Wooden Furniture.** The pieces of furniture still standing have an AC 15 and 25 hit points each. They provide half-cover.

### Running the Encounter
Below are general tactics for how to most effectively use the bale wolves in combat against the players.

**Initiating Combat.**
Bale wolves are ambush-oriented creatures, using darkness and cover to make their sneak attacks. They will patiently stalk prey until they see the opportunity to attack from stealth and surprise their victims.

**When to Retreat.**
Once bale wolves initiate their attack, they will fight to the death and relentlessly pursue fleeing players.


**Getting Advantage on Vicious Bite.**
In combat, the bale wolf's tactics revolve around it getting advantage on its bite attack to increase the odds of getting a crit with it. There are a few ways they can go about securing advantage:

* Utilizing their Pack Tactics
* Attacking from a hidden position
* Focusing their bites on a single target until they can knock it prone and pin it with their claws

**Working As a Pack.**
When bale wolves are operating as a pack, they instinctively hunt down the physically weakest player, relentlessly attacking until one of the bale wolves has the player prone and pinned. They will then move from player to player, repeating this process until they are all pinned, or there are only two bale wolves left. The remaining two bale wolves will then focus on the player closest to death. 

##### Dark Bloods
The key difference between these bale wolves and their "ordinary" kin is the curse they can inflict with their bite. There are some key strategies to keep in mind when cursing players:

* Prioratize attacking non-cursed players over cursed players to spread the curse to as many players as possible. Only focus on cursed players when they are doing something very disruptive, like pinning a bale wolf with their claws or scoring a critical hit on it.

* Cursed players who've lost control for a round and are attacking their allies can be used to trigger the bale wolf's Pack Tactics ability since they are momentarily on the same side.

### Aftermath
If the players flee, the bale wolves will relentlessly hunt them through the wilds until they reach civilization. The bale wolves will fight to the death.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what can be harvested from the remains of the bale wolves. If the players search the store, they'll find an abundance of trade goods as well as 2d4 x 100 gp worth of coins belonging to the former owners.

#### XP Award: 10,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the bale wolves can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the bale wolves without taking much damage or expending many resources, and none of them end up with a long-term curse.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the bale wolves, but one or more of them was dropped to 0 hit points or afflicted with the bale wolf curse and unable to shake it off. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to defeat either the bale wolf dark blood, or both of the other bale wolves but then flee the battle.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating dark blood or both of the other bale wolves.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-6).** Remove the two bale wolves, leaving only the bale wolf dark blood. Change the XP award to 3,500 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 11-13).** Replace the two regular bale wolves with bale wolf dark bloods. Change the XP award to 15,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Bale Wolf's Lair:** Tracing back the bale wolf dark blood's path could lead the players to its lair – a place filled with eerie ambiance, more threats, and clues about who or what set the creature on its destructive path. |
|  2  | **A Dignified Burial:** Among the slain bale wolves, the party identifies one as a long-lost friend or family member of a nearby village elder. The elder requests the party's help to lay their loved one's spirit to rest, which may involve a sacred rite or locating a treasured memento.|
|  3  | **Bale Master:** The dark blood's onslaught was no mere chance; it was directed by someone or something. The party finds evidence suggesting there’s a puppeteer in the shadows orchestrating these attacks as part of a larger plot.|
|  4  |**Rebuilding Efforts:** A nearby settlement decides to rebuild the trading post and requests the party’s assistance to secure the area, find supplies, and defend against any creatures drawn to the lingering dark energies. |

### The Bale Wolf Curse
&emsp;**Dark Transformation.** A creature afflicted with the Bale Wolf Curse is immediately subjected to a dark transformation into a bale wolf. The creature adopts the statistics of a bale wolf, with the following exceptions: it retains its original hit points, hit dice, and Constitution score. The creature's alignment and personality remain unchanged. 

Any equipment the creature was using or wearing drops to the ground at its current location, and for the duration of the transformation, the creature cannot interact with or benefit from its dropped equipment. Additionally, it cannot speak, cast spells, or perform any action requiring hands or speech.

**Dark Instincts.** At the start of each of its turns, the creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its psyche is overcome by the darkness within until the start of its next turn. During this time, it suffers from the following effects:

* It perceives all non-Balewolf creatures as enemies and all Balewolfs as allies until the start of its next turn.

* If there is a non-Balewolf creature within its reach, it must use the Attack action against the nearest one.

* If there are no creatures within its reach, it uses the Dash action to approach the nearest non-Balewolf creature it is aware of.

**Ending the Curse.** Should the creature succeed on this saving throw three times, the curse is lifted, and it reverts back to its original form. However, if the creature fails the save three times, the transformation becomes permanent. The creature then adopts the maximum hit points and Constitution score of a Balewolf, becomes an NPC under the DM's control.



Casting *dispel evil and good* or *remove curse* within the first hour of the transformation can reverse the curse. After this initial hour, only *dispel evil and good* or *remove curse*  spells cast at 9th level, the *wish* spell, or divine intervention can restore the creature to its original form.

### Bale Wolves Loot
The valuable items looted from cold ones will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a bale wolf. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Bale Wolf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
