## The War Elephant  <br> (Player Level: 7-9)
In this encounter, the players are traveling through a savanna, where they are confronted by a patrol group of soldiers riding a howdah-equipped elephant, seeking to crush them underfoot. 

### Lead Up
When the players spot the elephant with its howdah approaching, they can attempt to flee, turning the encounter into a chase. Once the players are in range, the soldiers on top of the howdah will immediately start firing arrows while the howdah master steers the elephant to charge.

### Encounter Context
When the players encounter the elephant patrol, it should be clear they aren't open to negotiations. They may belong to a faction the players are already enemies with, or they may have been ordered to mercilessly trample any intruders they find. You can have them working for a faction the players already know, use them to introduce a new faction, or simply have them be a gang of unhinged individuals that have somehow gotten a hold of a war elephant.

### The Trees
The encounter map features large 20-foot tall trees that can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics check outlined on the map.)

##### Map Legend
* <font color="918007">**Yellow To Red Areas:** Changes In Elevation </font>
* <font color="purple">**Purple Areas:** Trees </font>
* <font color="green">**Green Area:** Foliage creating an area of difficult terrain that lightly obscures creatures standing in it </font>
* **E:** Elephant starting location

<br>

 Creatures with a climb speed that are within 5 feet of the trunk don't need to make a check. Creatures in a tree have half cover and are lightly obscured. Each tree trunk has 50 hit points, an AC of 15, immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage. If a tree is destroyed, any creatures in the tree immediately fall out.

### Running the Encounter
The howdah master will focus on directing the elephant to repeatedly charge at the players while using truck attacks to separate them from each other, all while the archers pepper them with arrows. If the howdah master dies or is incapacitated, another member will take control of the elephant on their turn.

As long as the elephant is still alive, the raiding party inside will continue to fight with confidence. If the elephant is defeated, they will attempt to flee or surrender.

The elephant will enter a rampage if the crew is defeated and continue to attack. It can be calmed if charmed or if one of the players makes a successful DC 18 Animal Handling check against it.

### Loot 
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be harvested from the remains of the cheetahs. 

The soldiers carry valuables they've taken from previous battles. The value amount depends on the difficulty level of the encounter (see Adjusting The Difficulty section.)

#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in overcoming the hunters can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the soldiers without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the soldiers, but the players expend significant resources or take heavy damage in the fight.
* **50% XP:** The players escape the soldiers without defeating them.
* **10% XP:** The players surrender to the soldiers.



### Difficulty Levels
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

Regardless of the difficulty level of the encounter, the howdah will always house 4 **howdah soldiers** and 1 **howdah master**.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Commander's Orders:** After dealing with the patrol, the players find orders on the commander’s body detailing a larger military operation in the region. The players must decide whether to thwart these plans, potentially leading to a series of skirmishes with other patrols and a final confrontation with the general.|
|  2  | **Bounty Hunters:** The players discover that a bounty has been placed on their heads, and the patrol was just the first wave of bounty hunters. They must now deal with ongoing threats from mercenaries and assassins sent to claim the reward. |
|  3  | **Desperate Refugees:** The players encounter a group of refugees fleeing from the soldiers’ oppressive regime. Helping these refugees can lead to new quests, such as finding a safe haven, protecting them from further attacks, and dealing with internal conflicts. |
|  4  |**Weapon Cache:** Information obtained from the patrol reveals the location of a hidden weapons cache. The players can secure this cache to arm themselves or distribute it to local resistance groups, shifting the balance of power in the region. |

## Howdahs
War howdahs are small armored structured mounted to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use different types of howdahs in your games. They can be applied to howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own howdahs. 

Howdahs are generally structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger war beast of some kind. The creatures within the howdah are referred to as riders, and the creature the howdah is mounted upon is referred to as its steed. If one of the riders is controlling the steed, that creature is the pilot. Howdah riders and steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a howdah or its steed, the howdah and its steed are moved together.

* **Controlled & Independant Steeds.** The howdah's steed can be a controlled or independent mount as described in the player's handbook. If it is controlled, there must be a pilot who is controlling it.

* **Entering & Exiting Howdahs.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah. Any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. Each passenger already inside the howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.



### Howdah Saving Throws
While objects normally automatically fail all Strength, Dexterity, and Constituion saving throws, howdahs are active parts of combat, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, you can use the following rules when howdahs are subject to such saving throws.

#### Strength & Dexterity Saves
Howdahs equipped on an unencumbered steed do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as they can rely on their steed to make the save for them. If a howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, its steed must make the saving throw against the effect. If the steed succeeds on the save, the howdah passes the save.

#### Constitution Saves
Howdahs can make their own Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is mounted on a steed.

\columnbreak

### Opportunity Attacks
When the howdah steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the howdah itself. Passengers cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures outside the howdah.

### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures inside a howdah are considered within 5 feet of each other. Additionally, a creature inside a howdah does not gain disadvantage on ranged attacks due to a hostile creature being within 5 feet of it unless it is also in the howdah.

### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of three of the steed's largest hit dice.

### Teleporting
If the steed is teleported, the howdah and its riders can choose to teleport with it.

### Falling Howdahs
When a howdah's steed falls from a height of 10 feet or more, it and all its riders take fall damage as usual, and the riders fall prone.

### Repairing Howdahs
If a howdah has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting repairs, provided it has the necessary tools and parts. After 1 hour of work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus if proficient with the required tools. On success, the howdah regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. On failure, the howdah doesn't regain any hit points, but repairs can be reattempted with the same tools and parts.

### Howdah Destruction
When a howdah is destroyed, riders that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of its steed.

\pagebreakNum

## Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, howdahs have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Howdah DC 
Whenever the howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, that creature uses this value for the DC.

### Damage Threshold
Most howdahs possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the howdah takes the damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the howdah's hit points.

###  Steed Size
This is the minimum size a creature must be to be the howdah's steed. If a creature ever becomes too small to carry the howdah, the howdah falls off the creature and is knocked over as though its steed was knocked prone, described in the Prone Howdahs section.

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride in the howdah comfortably. Additional creatures may be able to fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the howdah at the DM's discretion.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the howdah adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning howdah, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the howdah is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits the howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

### Siege Weapons
A howdah may have one or more built-in siege weapons. These siege weapons are built into the howdah and share its Hit Points, AC, and Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the howdah is destroyed. These siege weapons can only be operated by riders in the howdah, and riders can't provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the howdah while operating these weapons. The weapons can't be used if the howdah is not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.

### Elephant Loot
The valuable items looted from elephants will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of an elephant. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Elephant Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
