## The Cheetah <br>Hunt Masters  <br> (Player Level: 5-7)
The players are traveling through a savanna, where they are ambushed by a hunting party commanding cheetahs who wish to capture the players for nefarious purposes.

### Lead Up
The hunters will attempt to ambush the party, lying in wait for them to get into position to strike. If the players fail to perceive the hunters and their cheetahs, start the encounter at the ambush start position on the map. Otherwise, if the players catch wind of what's going on, start the encounter at the player start position.

If you're using the harder djinni version of the encounter, the djinni will be invisible 60 feet in the air, waiting for the players to reach the ambush position. The enemy's goal is to capture the players and sell them into slavery, or in the djinni's case, take them back to their palace on the Plane of Air to be kept in their menagerie.

### The Trees
The encounter map features large 20-foot tall trees that can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics check outlined on the map.) Creatures with a climb speed that are within 5 feet of the trunk don't need to make a check. Creatures in a tree have half cover and are lightly obscured. Each tree trunk has 50 hit points, an AC of 15, immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage. If a tree is destroyed, any creatures in the tree immediately fall out.

### Aftermath
The cheetahs are loyal and will fight to the death. The hunters will continue to fight until they are either badly wounded (a scout at 6 HP, pack hunter at 20 HP, or djinni at 40 HP) or if the other hunters are already defeated or have run away. When the hunters have given up the fight, they will attempt to run away if they are able to. If they are surrounded, they will surrender to the players.

If the players attempt to flee, the hunters will use their cheetahs to run them down, so escape will be unlikely. If the players do have some means of outrunning their pursuers, you can turn the encounter into a chase using the chase encounter rules found in the DMG.

### Loot 
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be harvested from the remains of the cheetahs. 

The hunters carry valuables they've taken from their previous catches. The value amount depends on the difficulty level of the encounter (see Adjusting The Difficulty section.)

* **100% XP:** The players defeat the hunters, but the players expend significant resources or take heavy damage in the fight.
* **50% XP:** The players escape the hunters without defeating them.
* **10% XP:** The players are captured.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Hunters' Enterprise:** After defeating or escaping the ambush, the players find a map and coded messages on the cheetah handlers. These documents hint at a larger organization involved in capturing and trafficking humanoids. The players must decipher the code and follow the clues to uncover and dismantle the operation. |
|  2  | **The Captive Camp:** During the ambush, the players learn that other captives are being held at a nearby camp. They must decide whether to rescue these prisoners, leading to a mission to infiltrate the camp, free the captives, and deal with the remaining captors.  |
|  3  | **The Cheetah Collars:** The cheetahs are wearing enchanted collars that make them unusually aggressive and obedient to the handlers. Investigating these collars reveals they were created by a powerful sorcerer who is using them to control wildlife. The players must find and stop this sorcerer to prevent further misuse of magic. |
|  4  | **Mercenary Pursuit:** The cheetah handlers were hired by a powerful mercenary group to capture the players. This group now views the players as targets and pursues them across the savanna, leading to a series of intense encounters and battles. |

The whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60 feet as a bonus action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni is more than 120 feet away from it. A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.
> 
> **Innate Spellcasting.** The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

> 
> 3/day each: *create food and water, tongues, wind walk*
> 
> 1/day each: *creation, gaseous form, invisibility*
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> 
> ***Vapor Shift (3/day).*** The djinni or one willing creature it can see within 90 feet of it magically transforms into a vapor and moves up to 30 feet, and then reverts to its normal form. While in vapor form, the creature is under the effects of the *gaseous form* spell.

### Cheetah Loot
The valuable items looted from cheetahs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cheetah. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Cheetah Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
