## The Rhino Raider's Tithe  <br> (Player Level: 7-9)
The players are traveling through a savanna when they are confronted by an ogre riding a rhino who demands a tithe for passage through his territory.

### Lead Up
As the players journey, they notice an ogre approaching, mounted on a massive elasmotherium, who is demanding a toll for entering what he sees as his territory. The amount he's demanding depends on the difficulty level of the encounter (see Adjusting The Difficulty section.) 

The party can attempt to flee, turning the encounter into a chase (see the DMG for rules on chase encounters.) Should the ogre close the distance to within 40 feet, the chase ends, and he will demand immediate payment.

#### Tips For Roleplaying The Ogre
Keep the following considerations in mind depending on what approach the players take:

**Intimidation:** The ogre may avoid a fight if the party appears particularly intimidating.

**Superstition:** The ogre is very superstitious and might avoid conflict if it believes there will be bad luck or divine retribution for attacking the players.

**Bargaining:** Players can offer information about easy food or gold in exchange for passage.

**Valuable Items:** The ogre might accept a valuable item instead of payment, but this can backfire if the players are not convincing.

### The Tree
The encounter map features a large 20-foot tall tree that can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics check outlined on the map.) Creatures with a climb speed that are within 5 feet of the trunk don't need to make a check. Creatures in the tree have half cover and are lightly obscured. The tree trunk has 50 hit points, an AC of 15, immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage. If the tree is destroyed, any creatures in the tree immediately fall out.

### Aftermath
The ogre will attempt to flee if it appears he's losing the battle. If his rhino has been slain and it's clear he won't be able to escape, he will try to offer the players the loot he's carrying in exchange for his life.

If the players flee, the ogre will pursue them on his rhino until they are out of his territory.

### Loot 
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be harvested from the remains of the rhino.

The ogre carries valuables he's extorted from previous tolls. The value amount depends on the difficulty level of the encounter (see Adjusting The Difficulty section.)

#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in overcoming the ogre can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players avoid paying the toll through negotiation, or they defeat the ogre without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players avoid paying the toll through negotiation, or they defeat the ogre, but they take significant damage or expend major resources to do so.
* **50% XP:** The players manage to pay half the toll, or they flee the ogre and find another way to get around him.
* **10% XP:** The players pay the ogre the full toll, or they flee without finding another way around him.

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Hidden Cache:** The players discover a clue to a hidden cache of treasure the ogre had been collecting from travelers. Following this lead takes them deep into the savanna, where they must contend with natural hazards and competing treasure hunters. |
|  2  | **The Ogre's Debt:** The players learn that the ogre was collecting the tithe on behalf of a powerful local warlord. The warlord demands the players repay the ogreâ€™s debt or face his wrath.  |
|  3  | **Artifact of Power:** The players come across an ancient artifact the ogre had collected from a previous tithe, which holds immense power and a mysterious origin. The players must decide whether to use it, hide it, or return it to its rightful owners, all while dealing with factions seeking the artifact for themselves.  |
|  4  | **"This Isn't Ogre!":** The players attract the attention of the ogre's kin, who seek revenge. This leads to a series of skirmishes and, eventually, a showdown with the ogre clan. |

> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d10 + 6) piercing damage. If the cungye moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 22 (4d10) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the cungye's horn, causing it to be grappled (escape DC 18). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of the cungye's turns. The targetâ€™s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the cungye gains temporary hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The cungye can't grapple other creatures with its Gore while it has a creature grappled this way.
>
> ***Tide of Languish (1/Day).*** The cungye chooses four creatures in a 30-foot cube within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or fall prone and become cursed for the next 10 minutes. While cursed, the creature can't stand up and its Strength and Dexterity scores are reduced to 1. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending the curse on a success.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The cungye's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). The cungye can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
>
> ***At will:*** *detect evil and good, protection from evil and good*
>
> ***1/day each:*** *dispel evil and good, dispel magic (5th level), locate creature*

### Hornless Cungye

 Through the casting of powerful spells or twisted surgery, a cungye's horn can be stolen. A cungye can live for 3 + 2d4 days without its horn before it dies and returns to the abyss as a demon with a Challenge Rating (CR) of 4 or less. While it is alive, it is a CR 7 creature, but it loses its gore attack, innate spellcasting, and its Tide of Languish ability. The <br> horn is a magical item worth 500 gp that can be forged <br> into a *sword of life stealing* by someone with proficiency <br> in smith's tools using at least 300 gp worth of smithing supplies.

### Rhinoceros Loot
The valuable items looted from rhinos will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a rhino. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Rinoceros Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
