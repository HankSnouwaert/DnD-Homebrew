## The Hierophant's Sanctum <br> (Player Level: 17-19)
In this encounter, the players venture deep into a forgotten Tomb Kingdom sanctum to face The Grand Hierophant as he tries to plumb its forbidden secrets.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have traveled into a long-forgotten chamber of the Tomb Kingdoms with the intention of preventing some long-buried threat from being unleashed. It makes for a good final encounter to a Tomb Kingdom dungeon adventure where the players finally come face to face with The Grand Hierophant himself.

### Lead Up
The Grand Hierophant, along with his minions, resides within the chamber and will initiate an attack on the players as soon as he sees them. Baring magical means the players have no way to enter the chamber stealthily.

### Map Description
* **Chamber.** The platform in the center of the chamber is 60 feet above the entrance, and the ceiling is 60 feet above this platform.
* **The Pit.** The pit is 120 deep (from the top of the central platform.) If The Grand Hierophant ever falls off the platform, he will immediately be teleported back to its center.
* **Pillars.** The pillars are 30 feet high and do not reach the ceiling. They can be climbed with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

### Running the Encounter
Once The Grand Hierophant commences his attack, he will do everything he can to slay the players or at least ensure they cannot interfere with his machinations any further.

#### Summoned Eternal Guards
On initiative count 20 of each turn, if The Grand Hierophant has 3 minions or less, a tomb guard will be summoned to an unoccupied space on the platform of his choice. It acts on initiative count 1. If The Grand Hierophant is slain, all his minions will instantly crumble to dust.

#### Combat Tactics
For in-depth tactical tips on how to run The Grand Hierophant and his minions see the Encounter Reference Material later in this document.

* **H:** Start Location of The Grand Hierophant
* **G:** Start Location of Eternal Guards
* **C:** Start Location of Casket of Souls (Harder Version of Encounter Only)

<br>

### Aftermath
Because the chamber offers no easy means of escape and The Grand Hierophant is desperate to unlock its secrets, he will likely fight to the death. If it is clear he can't win and he sees an opportunity to use his minions to cover his exit, he may attempt to escape so he can make another attempt at plumbing the chamber's secrets later. 

If the players flee, he won't pursue them himself but may send minions after them if it seems like they could be finished off.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables and new magic item descriptions found later in this document to determine what valuables The Grand Hierophant and his minions might leave behind. Considering this encounter is likely to be a major boss battle, it may be fitting to reward the players with a magic item or loot from the Challenge 17+ treasure hoard table in the DMG. This treasure might be what the players plunder from the chamber or something they being carried by The Hierophant.

#### XP Award: 35,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating The Grand Hierophant can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat The Grand Hierophant without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat The Grand Hierophant, but one or more of their party members were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players temporarily foil The Grand Hierophant's plans here, but he manages to escape.
* **10% XP:** The players flee.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 15-17).** Remove The Grand Hierophant's Wrath of the Desert Feature and replace the eternal guards with tomb guards. Change the XP Award to 35,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Give The Grand Hierophant a Casket of Souls, and replace the tomb guard reinforcements with eternal guards. Change the XP award to 60,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Forbidden Knowledge:** Ancient texts speak of a ritual that can restore the Tomb Kingdoms to their full, living glory. The Grand Hierophant is on the verge of completing this ritual. The heroes must follow clues from various tombs, collecting artifacts and knowledge to stop him before he completes his grand design. |
|  2  | **Guardians of the Nexus:** The land's ley lines converge at an ancient, forgotten temple, and The Grand Hierophant plans to tap into this nexus. He intends to siphon its power, becoming a god-like being. To stop him, the heroes need to awaken the temple's ancient guardians and harness their unique abilities.|
|  3  | **Eclipse of Despair:** A rare celestial event is approaching, and The Grand Hierophant plans to harness its energy. If he succeeds, he will cast the world into an eternal twilight filled with undead horrors. The adventurers must journey through treacherous lands, gathering allies and learning of a way to prevent the Hierophant's dark ritual under the eclipse. |
|  4  |**The Pyramid Scheme:** Towering pyramids rise overnight near major cities. They drain life energy from nearby residents, channeling it to The Grand Hierophant to empower him in preparation for his ritual in the forgotten sanctum. Each pyramid presents a unique challenge, and all must be neutralized. |

While cursed, when a creature casts a spell with a verbal component, it must make a DC 15 ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a success, the curse ends for that creature.

\pagebreakNum

### Wrath of the Desert

The Grand Hierophant is protected by the gods of the desert, who can project their power at his behest. If you give him this ability, increase his CR by 1.     
 
 **Sand Storm (Recharges on a short rest).**
At the start of the round on Initiative count 20, The Grand Hierophant can create a 100-foot tall sandstorm with a 20-foot radius centered at a point within 120 feet of him. This ability can be activated even if The Grand Hierophant is incapacitated or surprised. The storm spreads around corners and lasts for 10 minutes, or until it is dismissed by The Grand Hierophant (no action required) or he dies.

The area within the storm is considered difficult terrain and is heavily obscured for creatures other than The Grand Hierophant. Additionally, ranged weapon attack rolls are made with disadvantage if their path passes through the storm.

On initiative count 20 of subsequent rounds, The Grand Hierophant can move the storm up to 20 feet in any direction. If the storm moves over a creature or if a creature ends its turn within the storm, that creature must make a Strength saving throw (The Grand Hierophant ignores this effect). On a failed save, the creature takes 6d6 slashing damage, is pulled 10 feet toward the storm's center, and if the creature is concentrating on a spell, it makes its concentration saving throw caused by the damage with disadvantage.
 


### Casket of Souls <br> (Harder Encounter Only)
  
The Grand Hierophant can be attuned to a Casket of Souls (whose mechanics are described below.) While attuned, he gains the following special abilities and is considered a CR 20 creature:
  
* He is immune to damage and cannot be moved or teleported against his will while within 5 feet of the casket.
  
* He can unleash the casket's souls (as described in the casket mechanics below) using a legendary action. The initial target for the souls must be the creature that just took its turn.
  
* He can use a legendary action to teleport the casket and himself to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the casket.

### Casket of Souls Mechanics

The casket of souls is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the casket if it has proficiency in the Religion skill and both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 14 or higher. 

A creature attuned to the casket can perform a minute-long ritual to summon it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat a casket of souls with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

\columnbreak



#### Unleashing the Souls

The creature attuned to the casket of souls and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the tormented souls within, targeting a creature it can see within 300 feet. The souls can then jump to another creature within 15 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 15 feet of that one. A creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per turn. A targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If a creature fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) or if the damage from this ability reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the casket begins extracting the target's soul. This effect ends if the casket is destroyed. The affected creature repeats the saving throw at the start of the casket user's next turn, with disadvantage if it has 0 hit points. On a success, the effect ends. If the creature fails, it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the casket until the casket is destroyed. While a creature's soul is trapped this way, it can't be resurrected.

#### Arcane Conduit

Additionally, creatures within 150 feet of the casket have a -1 penalty to their spell save DC and spell attack rolls. The creature attuned to the casket can choose for a creature to receive a +1 bonus instead. This modifier remains even if the creature attuned to the casket dies.

#### The Casket's Destruction

If the casket of souls is destroyed, the trapped souls are freed and lash out at all nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the casket must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock
___

You summon a swirling tempest of skulls in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This whirlwind lasts for the spell's duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The tempest spreads around corners, seeping through openings large enough for a tiny creature.
When you cast the spell, choose a direction. When the storm first appears, and at the start of each of your turns afterward, the swirling skulls move 30 feet in the chosen direction.

Any creature the storm passes though when moving must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct a cluster of skulls from the storm to streak toward a point you can see within 30 feet of the sphere. Once the skulls reach their destination or hit a solid surface, they lash out, biting at everything nearby. Every creature within 5 feet of where they stopped must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The skulls then return to the storm.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, damage dealt by the storm and the skull clusters increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

### The Grand Hierophant Tactics 
The Grand Hierophant represents the pinnacle of liche priest spellcasters. Always accompanied by a minimum of three elite undead warriors, The Grand Hierophant is a tactician who prioritizes his own safety over dealing direct damage. His potent ability to heal and resurrect his fallen soldiers makes him excel in prolonged engagements, often outlasting his enemies.

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word 
This ability is triggered in reaction to spellcasting threats. If any spellcaster manages to negate the curse, they immediately become the primary target for The Grand Hierophant and his minions.

#### The Grand Hierophant's Staff 
The Grand Hierophant strategically shares his concentration with the healthiest minion, ensuring it is not already paralyzed or vulnerable to incoming attacks. Furthermore, The Grand Hierophant can use the staff to concentrate on a variety of spells, each unlocking unique legendary actions. Below is a prioritized list detailing which spells he should cast first to harness their associated legendary actions.

##### Skull Storm
On its initial turn, The Grand Hierophant casts *skull storm*, targeting two or more enemies. After this, he deploys his Gust of Skulls legendary action whenever he can affect two or more targets again.

##### Black Tentacles
If The Grand Hierophant identifies two or more targets with low Dexterity and *skull storm* is no longer available, he will cast *black tentacles*. Once enemies are restrained, he will use his Drag Down legendary action. However, he avoids using this action on players with a high Strength saving throw, like barbarians.

##### Decrepify
This spell is reserved for scenarios where neither allies nor enemies are closely grouped for The Grand Hierophant's Incantation spells. The ideal targets are martial characters with weak Constitution saving throws. Once cast, he will use his Wither legendary action at the earliest opportunity.

\columnbreak

#### Incantation
The Grand Hierophant should cast spells using his Incantation legendary action when he can affect three or more powerful allies, particularly undead with a CR (Challenge Rating) of 3 or higher. However, these spells are of secondary priority if he can target three or more enemies with *black tentacles* or *skull storm*.

##### Specific Incantations and Their Uses:

**Guiding Wind:** 
* This spell should be deployed to swiftly move a large group of undead into melee combat.

* It is useful for allowing ranged archers to disengage from close combat.

* It acts as a potential escape route for The Grand Hierophant when surrounded. 

* Caution is advised, as adversaries within the spell's radius might also choose to be moved by it.

#####
**Incantation of Zeal vs. Incantation of Protection:**

* *Incantation of zeal* should generally be given priority over *incantation of protection*.

* However, if opponents possess bludgeoning weapons and The Grand Hierophant has skeletons under his command, or if a significant portion of the enemy group consists of martial classes using physical weaponry, then *incantation of protection* should be prioritized.

#### Tomb Strike Legendary Action
This action is used when The Grand Hierophant doesn't have a group of allies to enhance or isn't currently concentrating on a spell.

#### Wrath of the Desert
The Grand Hierophant summons this storm at the start of the fight and positions it to impact the highest number of targets. If players scatter, he directs the storm toward ranged attackers, aiming to disable their attack options.

#### Casket of Souls
When The Grand Hierophant uses the casket of souls, his strategy shifts. While he will still cast *skull storm* on his initial turn, all subsequent legendary actions will be devoted to utilizing the power of the casket.

### Grant Hierophant Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Grand Hierophant come in the form of relics and religious icons he carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Liche Priest Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you're running a battle in which he has a casket of souls, use the Grand Hierophant's Casket of Souls Loot Table to determine the additional relics the players are able to uncover.
