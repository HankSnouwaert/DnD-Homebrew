## Buried Ruins <br> (Player Level: 10-11)
In this encounter, the players enter the ruins of a desert tomb filled with interconnected sand pits where burrowing constructs lie in wait.

### Encounter Context
This encounter works well in the context of a larger dungeon, such as a lost desert tomb. It could also be a random encounter the players find while traveling through a desert. Very little setup is needed beyond this.

### Lead Up
The tomb stalkers in the sand pits will wait until the players enter the chamber before striking. They will attempt to stealthily move through the sands and burst up at their target's location, catching them by surprise. A player with a high enough passive Perception may be able to hear them coming and avoid being surprised.

### Map Description
* **Sand Pits.** The chamber is interspersed with areas of 40-foot-deep sand that creatures with a burrow speed can move through. All of the areas of sand are connected underneath the areas of stone tiles, allowing burrowed creatures to move underneath the tiles from one area of sand to another.
* **Broken Pillars.** The stone pillars are in various states of disrepair and can be climbed with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.

### Tomb Stalker Tactics
Tomb stalkers are ambush fighters who either use their burrowing abilities or False Appearance trait to catch foes by surprise and hit them with their Transmogrifying Gaze. At the end of each of its turns, the stalker will burrow underground, then pop out to attack any player that is either restrained by its gaze or has chosen not to avert its gaze.

### Eyes of the Desert Tactics <br> (Harder Encounter)
The Living Mirage ability allows these stalkers to play mind games with their foes. There are many ways to use this ability, but there are a couple of tactics to keep in mind:

* The stalker never ambushes with its Living Mirage active, as a creature would be forced to look at it and realize it's a fake. It waits until creatures can choose whether they will look at it and its copy before using the ability.

* The stalker and its double stay near each other, and at the end of each of their turns, they will attempt to burrow back under the ground, moving to different positions. This means that every time one of them emerges from the ground, its opponents will have to guess whether it's the double or the real one. The stalker should switch up each round, varying whether the copy takes its turn before or after the real one so as not to become predictable.

### Necroserpents Tactics <br> (Easier Encounter)

Necroserpents are ambush creatures that either pretend to be inanimate statues or hide beneath the sand, waiting for prey to pass by. In sandy environments, they will wait 25 feet beneath the sand and emerge 10 feet away from their intended victim. They attack with a bite and tail attack, then dive 25 feet below the surface again before repeating the process on their next turn.

Necroserpents act as skirmishers, attempting to poison as many targets as possible. They always leverage their reach and burrow speed to stay out of melee reach from their targets. They will also use their tails to push back any creature that could potentially make an attack of opportunity against them as they retreat underground.

### Aftermath
None of the enemies here will leave the vicinity of the encounter map to pursue the players, and none of them will flee the players, even if defeat is imminent. If the players triumph, they will be able to proceed through the chamber and further into the tomb.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found in the Encounter Reference Materials section to determine what the players are able to loot from defeated enemies. Because this is likely a random encounter or an encounter that's part of a larger dungeon adventure, there isn't any need to provide other sources of major treasure. 

#### XP Award: 9,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating burrowing constructs can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the foes without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the foes but take heavy damage or expend unnecessary resources due to poor tactics.
* **50% XP:** The players defeat one of the two enemies but flee the remaining one.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating either of their foes.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, <br> you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easiest Encounter (Level 5-7).** Remove one of the tomb stalkers. Change the XP Award to 4,000 XP.

**Easier Encounter (Level 7-9).** Replace the tomb stalkers with necroserpents (or a single eyes of the desert). Change the XP Award to 6,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 11-13).** Replace the tomb stalkers with eyes of the desert. Change the XP Award to 13,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The True Guardian:** The players' intrusion awakens not just the constructs but also the tomb's primary guardian - a mighty undead entity. This could be a giant mummy, a forgotten pharaoh, or a powerful liche. The players must either defeat this guardian or find a way to appease it to explore deeper or escape. |
|  2  | **The Unearthed Prophecy:** In the tomb, the players find ancient buried inscriptions prophesying a great calamity that could spill from the Tomb Kingdoms into the wider world. They must piece together clues and travel to various locations to prevent this dark future.|
|  3  | **The Liche-Priest's Experiment:** The tomb is actually a testing ground for a liche-priest's experiments. The players must deal with the outcomes of these experiments, which could range from unleashed magical energies to new, more powerful undead creatures. |
|  4  |**Race Against The Sands:** The tomb is collapsing, and the players must find a way out before they are buried beneath the sands. As they make their escape, they must contend with the constructs and other hazards that are now unleashed in the chaos. |

The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success. The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. While petrified this way, if the creature takes any damage or is moved, it crumbles into fine sand.
>
> Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can’t see the stalker until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the stalker in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
>
> If the stalker sees itself reflected on a polished surface within 30 feet of it and in an area of bright light, the stalker must make the saving throw against its own gaze, ignoring its immunity to being petrified and its Immutable Form trait.
>
> A creature holding a reflective surface that is affected by the gaze at the start of its turn may use its action to reflect the gaze back at the stalker by making a DC 17 Dexterity check; it has a disadvantage on the check if it averted its eyes. If the creature succeeds on check, the stalker is subjected to the effects of its own gaze.
>
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The stalker makes three attacks: two with its halberd and one with its tail.
>
> ***Halberd.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) slashing damage.

> ***Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage, and the stalker can push the target up to 5 feet away if it is Large or smaller.

### Harvestable Loot
The valuable items looted from tomb stalkers and necroserpents will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
