## Desert Scavengers <br> (Player Level: 10-11)
In this encounter, the players are traveling through a harsh desert when they find themselves ambushed by undead desert animals.

### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as an overland travel encounter that could be thrown at the players randomly or help serve as a lead-up to an upcoming adventure. The encounter can serve as a way to signal to the players they have now entered the land of the dead.

### Lead Up
The battle takes place in a desert that is mostly a sea of hot sand with patches of rocky outcropping dotting the landscape. A pair of tomb carrion will begin circling the players about 100 feet overhead as they approach the area of the map. If none of the players are on the lookout or state that they are looking up at the sky, they won't notice these giant undead vultures. The tomb carrion will dive after the players if they're attacked or when they see the players come under attack. 

The tomb swarms begin hidden under the sands and will attempt to stealthily burrow up and catch the players by surprise once they've entered the area of the map.

### Map Description
* **Rocks.** Creatures can walk up the sloping sides of the rocks without being impeded, but the tomb swarms cannot burrow through them. Creatures without a climb speed that try to climb up the sides with sheer drops must succeed on a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check to do so.
* **Sand.** This is open terrain that the tomb swarms can burrow through.

### Running the Encounter
The tomb swarms and tomb carrion will work in tandem to slay and devour the players. However, with no master present guiding them, they will operate on malevolent instinct.

#### Tomb Swarms
These undead swarms will spring an ambush on which ever player they can each reach first. They are made up of a mass of mindless undead creatures acting with just enough collective intelligence to maintain a unified cohesion as they hunt. Beyond this, they are mindless in their tactics. They focus on attacking the closest prey available, using their numbers to overwhelm and devour their victim. They will generally choose victims in the sand rather than the rocks but won't hesitate to pursue players onto the rocks if there are no other options.

#### Tomb Carrion
When these birds attack, they will dive down and use their Spew Filth ability as soon as they are in range and able to hit multiple players. They will then focus their attacks on whoever has the most levels of exhaustion. They will typically stop their attacks to use Feast whenever the opportunity presents itself. They will generally choose victims who are higher up on the rocks but won't hesitate to pursue players down into the sand if there are no other options. 


### Aftermath
Being undead creatures, the tomb carrion and tomb swarms have no sense of mortal fear and will fight to the death. If the players flee, they will flee after them, in which case you can use the chase rules described in the Dungeon Master's Guide.

#### Loot
After the battle, the players will be able to loot the remains of the undead creatures. You can use the loot tables found in the Encounter Reference Material section for this. Because this is a random encounter in the middle of the desert, there likely won't be any need to award significant treasure.

#### XP Award: 6,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the undead creatures can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the creatures without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the creatures, but one or more of their party members was dropped to 0 hit points, or they were forced to expend much of their resources. 
* **50% XP:** The players slay at least half the creatures but flee the rest.
* **10% XP:** The players flee after defeating less than half the creatures.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 6-8).** Replace the large tomb swarms with Medium sized tomb swarms. Change the XP award to 4,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 12-14).** Replace the tomb carrion with sacred tomb carrion. Change the XP award to 12,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Rising Sand King:** The creatures were sent as scouts, searching for the living. Deep beneath the desert, a once-forgotten pharaoh awakens, aiming to rebuild his lost empire. The adventurers are now unwittingly marked as threats to be eradicated or enslaved. |
|  2  | **The Desert's Dark Heart:** The attacks increase in frequency, leading the party to discover a central, ancient pyramid that seems to pulse with dark energy. The creatures are drawn to this structure. Can the party find a way to shut down the malevolent force emanating from this edifice? |
|  3  | **Desert Plague:** The tomb swarms are the harbingers of a mummy's curse that spreads throughout the land, affecting both the living and the undead. The adventurers must seek out the source of this curse and end it before the desert becomes a wasteland of the cursed. |
|  4  | **Beneath the Sands:** The desert is changing. Dunes shift overnight to reveal crypt entrances, and at the heart of it all is a vast underground necropolis. The tomb carrion and swarms are but hints of what lies beneath. |

### Tomb Carrion Loot
The valuable items looted from tomb carrion will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Carrion Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

|  17-21 | 1d4(2) 20gp Items  |  
|  22+ |  1d6(3) 20gp Items | 


#### Example Tomb Carrion Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.
