## Tomb of Dread <br> (Player Level: 16-18)
In this encounter, the players enter a forbidden chamber where a liche priest is in the process of awakening a dread sphinx to unleash upon the world.


### Encounter Context
This could be the final encounter of an adventure featuring the liche priest as the primary antagonist. With the adventures having overcome everything he's thrown at them, the priest now turns to an act of blasphemous desperation by awakening the dread sphinx. Alternatively, the liche may be awakening the sphinx in preparation for a grand invasion, and the players must stop him before he can deploy it.

### Lead Up
The players should be aware of the liche before they even enter the chamber as they will hear him chanting. The liche will have a high vantage point from the top of the stairs, allowing him to see the party approach; the dread sphinx will enter from the top of the map at the start of the second round, and roll for initiative

### Running the Encounter
The liche priest will rely on the dread sphinx to keep the players at bay while it uses its array of spells to tip the odds in its favor. 
#### Liche Priest Tactics
Liches can wisely identify party members with weak proficiencies and saving throws and use that to determine who to target with what spells. 

**Guiding Wind:** This spell can serve as an escape for the liche if he's in melee combat. However, be cautious with the positioning of the spell; enemies within the spell's radius can opt to be moved by it as well.

**Incantation of Protection or Incantation of Zeal:** The liche priest will prioritize using *incantation of zeal* rather than *incantation of protection* to support the dread sphinx unless the sphinx is taking more than 50 physical damage each round, in which cast he will switch to *incantation of protection*.

**Black Tentacles or Decrepify:** Cast *black tentacles* when three or more targets are available, or if two targets engage with minions. Be wary; skeletons affected by this spell will incur double damage. If targets are dispersed, use *decrepify*—preferably a martial character with a weak Constitution saving throw.

**Skull Storm:** Use *skull storm* once it can affect three targets. If it can hit two targets, prioritize the spell's bonus action over the liche's Dredge ability. The liche might opt to move alongside the spell to shield itself from ranged attacks. The Liche will cease concentration on this spell if the initial storm has moved beyond outside the field of battle or if the spell's bonus action can't affect two or more targets.

#### Dread Sphinx Tactics

Dread sphinxes are giant, straightforward killing machines. When they see a large group of targets, they'll dive in with their Impact Tremor. They will then choose a prime target for decapitation and target it with a Sting attack before following up with their Blade attack. Their preferred targets are the ones with the most health, such as barbarians, paladins, and fighters.

If the sphinx is quickened by the liche priest's *incantation of zeal*, it will use its extra attack to use another Sting since it can still only use its Decapitating Strike ability once per turn.

##### The Underworld Butcher (Harder Encounter)
The biggest tactical difference with this sphinx is its new legendary actions. It will use its Blade Rush legendary action to help build up stacks of fire damage on its Blade attacks. If there are multiple enemy spells that all have a combined spell level of approximately 9 or higher, it will use all its legendary actions to use Consuming Flame to attempt to dispel them all.

### Aftermath
The dread sphinx is a force of pure malevolent destruction and will fight to the end. The liche priest is likely backed into a corner and won't flee unless he believes he'd have a chance of escaping and plotting his revenge against the players. 

If the players flee, the dread sphinx will ruthlessly hunt them down unless it is severely damaged, and the liche priest is there to order it to stop. 

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found in the Encounter Reference Materials section to determine what the players are able to loot from defeated enemies. Because this is likely a climactic battle that may even be the final fight of an adventure, it is an opportune time to award the players part of, if not an entire, treasure hoard appropriate to their level. This treasure will come in the form of riches and finely crafted items being kept in this lost tomb, which will likely include a magic item or two.

#### XP Award: 30,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the liche priest and the dread sphinx can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the foes without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the foes but take heavy damage or expend unnecessary resources due to poor tactics.
* **50% XP:** The players either defeat the dread sphinx or the liche priest but flee the remaining foe.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating the dread sphinx or the liche priest.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 13-15).** Replace the high liche priest with a liche priest. Change the XP Award to 20,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Replace the dread sphinx with The Underworld Butcher. Change the XP Award to 60,000 XP.

At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Constitution saving throw, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration becomes 24 hours and the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a short or long rest.

___

You summon a potent gust of wind, forming a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This wind then moves in a straight line up to 30 feet in a direction you choose. When the sphere initially forms, any Medium or smaller creature or unsecured object within its area is lifted and carried by the wind for the distance it travels. Creatures can choose to resist and remain stationary instead of being carried by the wind.

\columnbreak

- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  1 round.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Bard, Paladin

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tooth)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock
___

You summon a swirling tempest of skulls in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This whirlwind lasts for the spell's duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The tempest spreads around corners, seeping through openings large enough for a tiny creature.
When you cast the spell, choose a direction. When the storm first appears, and at the start of each of your turns afterward, the swirling skulls move 30 feet in the chosen direction.

Any creature the storm passes though when moving must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct a cluster of skulls from the storm to streak toward a point you can see within 30 feet of the sphere. Once the skulls reach their destination or hit a solid surface, they lash out, biting at everything nearby. Every creature within 5 feet of where they stopped must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The skulls then return to the storm.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, damage dealt by the storm and the skull clusters increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

## Creature Loot

### Liche Priest Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from liche priests come in the form of relics and religious icons they carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Liche Priest Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Dread Sphinx Loot
The valuable items looted from dread sphinxes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
