## The Tomb Gate <br> (Player Level: 10-11)
In this encounter, the players attempt to reach the entrance to a lost desert tomb, which happens to be protected by a screaming skull catapult and a tomb scorpion hidden in the sands.

### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players are attempting to reach the entrance of the tomb. They may have been tasked with doing so or have their own reasons for wanting to reach the inside. The tomb should be built into a cliff face of some sort so as to prevent the players from attempting to circle around and approach the entrance from a different angle.

### Lead Up
The skeletal crew will have a skull ready to launch at the players as soon as they come within range. The tomb scorpion will be waiting underground. It will only emerge to attack an enemy walking across the tiles it is buried under or an enemy who comes within melee range of the catapult or its crew.

### Map Description
* **The Stone Covered Sand Pit.** The stones in the red square on the map are thinner than the rest and cover a 40-foot deep pit covered in sand, which contains a tomb scorpion (or tomb swarm on an easier difficulty). Any creature crossing these stones can tell they are differently made than the other tiles. The tiles are thin enough that a tomb scorpion can break through them with its burrowing, and they contain numerous 1-inch-diameter holes to allow tomb swarms to move through them.
* **Pillars.** The stone pillars are 30 feet high and can be climbed with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.

### Running the Encounter
Once the catapult commences its attack, the crew will primarily focus on enemy melee fighters, as the fear effects of the screaming skulls can prevent them from closing in. If anyone does manage to close in on the catapult or crosses the sand pit, whatever is burrowed within will strike.

### Tomb Scorpion Tactics

**The Ambush.** These constructs have the ability to burrow underground, allowing them to catch their prey off guard. The tomb scorpion will wait 30 feet beneath the surface for intruders to pass by. When it senses a creature with its tremor sense, it will move up towards its target using its Burst Forth feature to knock enemies prone and gain advantage on all its attacks.

##### Map Legend

* **Green & Yellow Lines:** Changes In Elevation
* **T:** Start Location of Tomb Scorpion
* **C:** Start Location of Screaming Skull Catapult
* **S:** Start Location of Skeleton Crewman

<br>

**Attack Sequence.** The tomb scorpion is built to focus its attacks on a single target. It will use both of its claw attacks against a target, prioritizing anyone that has been knocked prone by its Burst Forth feature so that it can keep the target from standing back up if any of the attacks hit. It will then attempt to sting the target. 

If it is unable to hit a target with a claw attack, it will retreat back underground and attempt to use its Burst Forth feature again. If it does have the target grappled, it will use its Pull Apart action on that target next turn. 

If the target is grappled, it will sting it unless the target has already been poisoned, in which case it will sting another target.

**Protecting the Catapult.** If the tomb scorpion is keeping enemies away from the catapult, it will attempt to grapple them and move them out of melee range from the catapult and its crew. Pulling multiple threats away from the catapult is more important than doing maximum damage to a single target.

### Tomb Swarm Tactics
Tomb swarms are made up of a mass of mindless undead creatures acting with just enough collective intelligence to maintain a unified cohesion as they hunt. Beyond this, they are mindless in their tactics. They remain hidden in crevasses or underground until they detect prey, then they burst forth for a surprise attack. They focus on attacking the closest prey available, using their numbers to overwhelm and devour their victim.

Because it is acting in the service of the undead manning the catapult, the tomb swarm will prioritize attacking whoever is posing the greatest threat to the catapult and its crew.

### Aftermath
None of the enemies here will leave the vicinity of the encounter map to pursue the players, and none of them will flee the players, even if defeat is imminent.  If the players triumph, they will be able to proceed into the tomb.

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found in the Encounter Reference Materials section to determine what the players are able to loot from defeated enemies. Because the real prize the players are after lies within the tomb, they are unlikely to find much else in the immediate vicinity. Inside the tomb, they are likely to find treasure from a treasure hoard appropriate to their level, but they may have to make it past more threats to reach this loot.

#### XP Award: 9,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating The Grand Hierophant can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the foes without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the foes but take heavy damage or expend unnecessary resources due to poor tactics.
* **50% XP:** The players either defeat the burrowed guardian or destroy the catapult but flee the remaining foes.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating the burrowed guardian or the catapult.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, <br> you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 7-9).** Replace the tomb <br> scorpion with a large tomb swarm. Change the <br> XP Award to 6,000 XP.

**Easiest Encounter (Level 5-7).** Replace <br> the tomb scorpion with a tomb swarm. <br> Change the XP Award to 4,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Tomb Treasure:** Once inside the tomb, the players discover it's the resting place of an ancient, powerful artifact, now sought by multiple factions. They must navigate a labyrinth of traps, solve ancient puzzles, and decide the artifact's fate. |
|  2  | **The Haunting Curse:** Delving deeper into the tomb, the players unwittingly trigger an ancient curse. Plagued by haunting visions and relentless undead assailants, they must find a way to lift the curse before it consumes them.|
|  3  | **The Pharaoh's Awakening:** The tomb is the prison of a long-forgotten pharaoh, whose awakening could spell disaster. The players must either stop the awakening or contend with the unleashed might of a vengeful undead ruler. |
|  4  |**The Doomed Expedition:** The players discover remnants of a previous expedition, with clues suggesting they unearthed something they shouldn't have. Tracing their steps could lead to a greater understanding of the tomb's secrets or a lurking danger within its depths. |

If it fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5), the damage is doubled. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies as it is torn in half.
>
> ***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw.

### Screaming Skull Catapult Loot

Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these screaming scull catapults are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Mason’s Tools) check. Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the crewmen come in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Screaming Skull Catapult Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
