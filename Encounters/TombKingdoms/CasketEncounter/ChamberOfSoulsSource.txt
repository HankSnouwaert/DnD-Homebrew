## Chamber of Souls <br> (Player Level: 15-17)
In this encounter, the players venture into a grand Tomb Kingdom chamber, where they face off against liche priests wielding the power of a casket of souls.

### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as part of a dungeon adventure. It could be something the players face part way through the dungeon or its final climactic encounter.

### Lead Up
The battle begins as soon as the players enter the chamber and are spotted by the undead within. Because there is no cover across the entrance way, sneaking in without the aid of magic will be difficult.

### Map Description
* **Walls and Pillars.** The pillars reach up to the ceiling. The walls and pillars can be climbed with a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Lighting.** The chamber is lit by many torches around its center.
* **Cursed Pool.** The pool in the center of the room is filled with necrotic water that is 10 feet deep and deadly to the living. Any non-undead creature that enters the water for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes 18 (4d8) necrotic damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. A creature using an ability such as the *water walk* spell can move across its surface without being harmed.

### Running the Encounter
Once any of the undead spot the players, they will initiate their attack. Though the waters of the pool won't harm the undead, they will still avoid fighting in it, as being in water imposes disadvantage on their weapon attacks. Instead, the tomb guards may attempt to shove players into the water while the archers shoot at them from a distance. 

#### The Liche Priests

The liche priests will keep their distance from the players, using their minions to keep them safe, and they can wisely identify party members with weak proficiencies and saving throws and use that to determine who to target with what spells. All liches (including the keeper of rites) use the Hieratic Hierarchy rule described later in the document.) They prioritize dealing damage, and will sacrifice minions to empower themselves. They reserve their stronger spells for later stages of combat when enemies are more likely to fail their saves, thanks to their Life Leech trait.

They will use their spells in the following ways:

**Crippling Pain:** Target skirmishers like rogues or monks to hinder their combat effectiveness.

<br>


&emsp;**Spirit Leech:** Use when a target with low Charisma is within range or when the liche's health drops below half.

**Impending Doom:** Target martial characters with multiple attacks and low Charisma.

**Horrifying Laughter or Wind of Death:**  Use *horrifying laughter* to target martial characters with low Wisdom scores. Switch to *wind of death* when its saving throw has been boosted by at least +1 or if it can affect four or more targets, as it synergizes well with the Life Leech trait.

**Aspect of Dread:** This is a strong opening spell, forcing multiple targets to make saving throws and fueling the liche's Life Leech trait. It can also be cast on an enemy to frighten its allies or serve as an escape tool when the liche is surrounded.

#### Keeper of Rites
This liche doesn't have access to any combat spells and will focus on striking down the most dangerous players using the casket. It will also help the other liches maintain concentration on one of their spells using their Hieratic Hierarchy feature.

### Aftermath
The liche priests will be loathe to lose their casket of souls and will only attempt a retreat if their defeat is unquestionably imminent. If the players flee, they will not pursue them far from the chamber and risk leaving their casket behind.

#### Loot
After the battle, the players will be able to loot the remains of the casket and the liche priests along with their minions. You can use the loot tables found in the Encounter Reference Material section for this. If you wish to provide additional treasure, you can have the casket embedded with 3d6 (10) black opals worth 1,000 gp each.

#### XP Award: 25,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the liches and their minions can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeated all their foes without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeated the liches, but one or more of their party members was dropped to 0 hit points, or they were forced to expend much of their resources. 
* **50% XP:** The players slew at least two of the liches but fled the remaining undead.
* **10% XP:** The players fled without defeating at least two of the liches.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 10-12).** Replace the liche priests with liche acolytes and the tomb guard with skeleton spearmen. Change the XP award to 10,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Replace the liche priests with high liche priests, the tomb guard with scorpion legion spearmen, and the skeletal archers with hawk legion archers. Change the XP award to 60,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Prophesied Heir:** An ancient prophecy speaks of a living heir to the Tomb Kingdoms. This heir has been found, and now the players must escort them to the chamber to perform a ritual that will break the power of the undead. The liche priests are there to stop the party and the heir at any cost.|
|  2  | **Tormented Whispers:** One of the players has been hearing mysterious whispers leading them to the chamber. These whispers are from souls trapped within the Casket, pleading for release. The adventures must defeat the liches and find a way to free the souls. |
|  3  | **Tomb Spirits:** Ghostly apparitions of Tomb Kingdom royalty appear around the land, causing chaos. They all point towards the chamber, where the liche priests use the Casket of Souls to manifest these spirits. The players must resolve the restless spirits' grievances and confront the priests. |
|  4  | **Times of Old:** Time anomalies start to occur around the region. At the epicenter is the ancient chamber where the liche priests, with the power of the Casket, attempt to rewind time and restore the Tomb Kingdoms' living glory. |

### Hieratic Hierarchy

When several Tomb Kingdom priests collaborate in their usage of magic, they can combine their powers to form an arcane hierarchy that allows them to support each others' abilities.

A hierarchy consists of at least two spell casters in service to the Tomb Kingdoms. Any of the creatures in this document can be members of a hierarchy. The Challenge Rating (CR) of members of a hierarchy should be increased by 1.

Members of a hierarchy gain the following benefits:

* Upon rolling initiative, members of a hierarchy can swap their initiative orders with each other in any order they agree upon. <br><br>

<br><br>

* When a member of the hierarchy casts a spell requiring concentration, it can choose another willing member who isn't already concentrating on a spell to maintain concentration on the spell in its place. Moreover, if a member dies while concentrating on a spell, another member can choose to maintain concentration of the spell for its remaining duration.

* All members gain a +1 bonus to saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells for each hierarchy member within 60 feet.

- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Crippling Pain
*3rd-level necromancy*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Wizard, Warlock

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Horrifying Laughter
*6th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Wizard
___

You target a creature you can see within range, causing it to collapse into debilitating fits of deranged laughter. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less aren't affected.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration, any creature within 30 feet of the laughing creature that can hear the laughter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the laughing creature until the end of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it stabilizes but remains laughing and can no longer attempt saving throws against the spell. If the spell ends while the creature has 0 hit points, it dies.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

### Casket of Souls Mechanics

The casket of souls is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the casket if it has proficiency in the Religion skill and both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 14 or higher. 

A creature attuned to the casket can perform a minute-long ritual to summon it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat a casket of souls with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

#### Unleashing the Souls

The creature attuned to the casket of souls and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the tormented souls within, targeting a creature it can see within 300 feet. The souls can then jump to another creature within 15 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 15 feet of that one. A creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per turn. A targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If a creature fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) or if the damage from this ability reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the casket begins extracting the target's soul. This effect ends if the casket is destroyed. The affected creature repeats the saving throw at the start of the casket user's next turn, with disadvantage if it has 0 hit points. On a success, the effect ends. If the creature fails, it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the casket until the casket is destroyed. While a creature's soul is trapped this way, it can't be resurrected.

#### Arcane Conduit

Additionally, creatures within 150 feet of the casket have a -1 penalty to their spell save DC and spell attack rolls. The creature attuned to the casket can choose for a creature to receive a +1 bonus instead. This modifier remains even if the creature attuned to the casket dies.

#### The Casket's Destruction

If the casket of souls is destroyed, the trapped souls are freed and lash out at all nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the casket must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw; it has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is poisoned. On a failed save, it takes 15 (3d8) poison damage and is poisoned until the start of the skeleton's next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned.

### Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from liche priests come in the form of relics and religious icons they carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
