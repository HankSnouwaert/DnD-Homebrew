## Pirate's Crossing  <br> (Player Level: 5-6)
In this encounter, the players must fight their way across a bridge guarded by pirates atop a watch tower, one of whom rides a parrot-griffon monster. If the pirates are losing, they will try to destroy the bridge before the players can stop them.



### Encounter Context
The players are tasked with removing the pirates from the watchtower, which controls a critical bridge for travel and trade in the area. Alternatively, the players may simply need to cross the bridge, which is the only crossing available. The pirates may demand a toll (10 gold for an easy encounter, 20 gold for a hard encounter). If the players refuse to pay, the pirates will attack.



### Pirate Tactics

&emsp;**Crackshots:** These pirates will keep their distance, with one staying in the crow's nest and the other using the paragriffon to fly above the battlefield. The paragriffon (an independent mount) avoids melee combat, using its Mocking Squawk and Roaring Squawk to harass the players. If its rider falls to 0 hit points, the paragriffon will dive into melee combat.

**Boarders:** These pirates use their grappling hooks to swing into combat, attempting to knock players off the bridge with their kicks. If they are losing, they will attempt to destroy the bridge out of spite, either when all pirates have less than half their health or when two or more pirates have been knocked unconscious or killed. The pirates are very proud, and may even kill themselves to destroy the bridge if the players are also on the bridge.

### Terrain Features

#### The Bridge
A 5-foot square of the bridge can be destroyed by dealing 30 damage to the area (AC 15, immunity to psychic and poison damage, and resistance to all damage except fire and acid). The entire bridge can be destroyed by cutting the ropes, which have 60 hit points and AC 10, with vulnerability to slashing damage.

#### The Trees
The encounter map features large 20-foot tall trees that can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics check outlined on the map.)
Creatures with a climb speed that are within 5 feet of the trunk don't need to make a check. Creatures in a tree have half cover and are lightly obscured. Each tree trunk has 50 hit points, an AC of 15, immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage. If a tree is destroyed, any creatures in the tree immediately fall out.

#### Falling In The Water

If a creature falls into the water, it can climb up the side of the cliffs with a DC 18 Strength (Athletics) check. On a failure, it falls back into the water.Â  A creature with a climb speed does not need to make this check.

### Resolution 

&emsp;**Fleeing:** If the encounter turns against the players, they can attempt to flee. Only the pirate on the paragriffon will pursue them, with the rest staying to guard the bridge.

**Victory:** The pirates will only surrender if they have no chance of defeating the players or destroying the bridge. Success should be judged based on whether the players managed to keep the bridge intact.

#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in defeating the pirates can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the enemy pirates without taking much damage or expending many resources and prevent the bridge from being destroyed.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all their foes and prevent the bridge from being destroyed, but one or more of their party members are dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to defeat the pirates, but they don't prevent the bridge from being destroyed.
* **10% XP:** The players flee the pirates.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 


**Standard Encounter (Level 5-6).** 
* Use **Crackshots** & **Ship Boarders**
* XP Award: 1,500 XP

**Harder Encounter (Level 7-9).** 
* Replace the **Crackshots** with **Trickshots** & the **Ship Boarders** with **Bloody Boot Boarders**
* XP Award: 6,000 XP
