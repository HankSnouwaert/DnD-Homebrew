## The Counsel of Captains  <br> (Player Level: 7-9)
In this encounter, the players interrupt a pirate counsel where three captains are having a heated dispute and ask the players to pick which one of them is right. If the players choose one, the other two team up to attack the players and the captain they picked.



### Encounter Context
The pirate captains are squabbling among themselves when the players appear. If they spot the players and the players aren't hostile, they will ask them to settle their argument by picking which one is right. The nature of the argument can vary depending on your campaign, but below are some suggestions:

| d4  | Captain Arguments |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |The captains are arguing over which one of them is more intimidating and, therefore, should be in charge, each showing off their abilities to the players, telling them to decide. |
|  2  | The captains have happened upon a magic item from the last treasure hoard they obtained and are bickering over who gets to keep it. |
|  3  | The captains are arguing over where to sail next and ask the players which venture they should go on. |
|  4  | Each captain has a different mission they want the players to embark on for them. The players must decide which mission they want to take. |


### Lead Up
Regardless of the nature of the pirates' arguments, it must be made clear to the players that they aren't hostile so that they have the opportunity to choose a captain's side. Once the players pick a captain, the other two will become furious and ally together to attack the players and the other captain they picked. The captain the players sided with will aid them in the battle against the other captain.

On the harder encounter difficulty, the crews of each of the captains will join in on the fight. On the easier encounter difficulty, you can choose to have them merely be bystanders who are too cowardly or uncertain to join the fight or not have them at all.

If the party ends up attacking the captains before they get a chance to converse with them, all three of the captains will attack the players together.

### Pirate Captain Tactics
All captains possess the Pick a Fight ability, encouraging them to distribute their attacks across multiple adversaries.

#### Trickshot Scoundrel Tactics 
&emsp;**Mobility:** The scoundrel can move within 10 feet of a target to gain advantage from point blank, then retreat out of reach.

**Combat Flexibility:** The scoundrel can shoot a different target 10 feet away while engaged in melee combat, using the Point Blank feature to negate the disadvantage of close-range firearm use.

**Double Up:** If the ricochet shot targets a creature within 10 feet of the scoundrel, the disadvantage on the ricochet can be negated thanks to the Point Blank trait.

#### Drunken Master Tactics
&emsp;**Riot Tactics:** An effective way to activate this ability is to grapple one opponent, move to another, and use a Dazing Strike to hinder the second opponent's mobility.

#### Storm Sword Tactics
&emsp;**Harassment Strategy:** This captain excels at bypassing frontline fighters to target backline casters and archers, disrupting their ability to support their frontlines effectively.

### Aftermath
Depending on the nature of your campaign or setting, the captains may not see this as a fight to the death. It might be expected that the winner will revive the losers after the fight is done, in which case all the captains will fight until they can no longer. 

If the players and their captain ally lose the fight and are all reduced to 0 hit the points, the enemy pirate captains may revive them, gloat over their victory, and then send them on their way.

If the players flee, the remaining pirate captains may chase after to punish them for their choices.

If the players win the fight and their ally survives, the captain may reward them with valuables or their services or may offer them follow-up jobs that could lead to further adventures.



#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in defeating the pirates can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the enemy pirates without taking much damage or expending many resources, and the allied captain never drops to 0 hit points.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all their foes, but one or more of their party members (or the allied captain) were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to defeat one pirate but flee the remaining one.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating any of the pirates or lose the battle entirely.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 


**Easier Encounter (Level 5-6).** 
* The plunderers stay out of the fight (or simply aren't there)
* XP Award: 1,500 XP

**Standard Encounter (Level 7-9).** 
* The plunderers all enter the fight on behalf of their respective captains 
* XP Award: 6,000 XP

During this movement, the storm sword can move through the space of other creatures, and it does not provoke opportunity attacks. If the storm sword ends its turn inside a creature’s space, it is pushed into the nearest unoccupied space. The storm sword may have each creature whose space it moves through make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the storm sword automatically hits the target with a rapier attack.

If the creature is pulled within 5 feet of the storm sword, the storm sword automatically hits the target with a rapier attack. If the target fails by 10 or more (DC 6), the attack is a critical hit.
