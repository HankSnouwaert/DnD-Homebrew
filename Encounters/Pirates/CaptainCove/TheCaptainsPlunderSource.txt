## The Captain's Plunder  <br> (Player Level: 5-6)
In this encounter, the players battle a pirate captain at his island hideout to reclaim stolen treasure.
### Encounter Context

This encounter can serve as the final battle in a pirate-themed adventure or as a standalone one-off encounter, where the players are meeting the captain for the first time. In either scenario, the players should be aware that the pirate possesses a large amount of stolen treasure.

### Lead Up
The captain should be aware that the players are on their way and be on the lookout for them. The island hideout is made to be difficult to assault from most angles; the players will likely have to confront the captain head-on.

### The Trees
The encounter map features large 20-foot tall trees that can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics check outlined on the map.)
Creatures with a climb speed that are within 5 feet of the trunk don't need to make a check.

 Creatures in a tree have half cover and are lightly obscured. Each tree trunk has 50 hit points, an AC of 15, immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage. If a tree is destroyed, any creatures in the tree immediately fall out.

### Running the Encounter
The pirates are immediately hostile to the players and will demand their unconditional surrender. If the players don't comply, the pirates will attempt to kill them on the spot and rob them of all their valuables.

The captain is extremely proud and greedy and will likely die defending his treasure. If the players flee, the captain will rally more crew mates to hunt them down but won't chase them himself if doing so would leave the island undefended.

#### Captain Tactics 

Captains typically use their Warning Shot ability before their All Aboard so that the frightened targets can be pelted with gunfire and left unable to get closer.

If the players have a lot of ranged attackers, the captain will use his All Aboard ability first instead. Once a captain is out of ammo, he will charge in if he has allies to help him utilize his Opportunist reaction.

#### Pirate Admiral Tactics
Pirate admirals differ from captains by having Sneak Attack and Raise Morale abilities. They are reliant on their minions to help them consistently gain an advantage.

#### Powderhand Tactics
In an optimal situation, a powderhand should move within 10 feet of a target and then back up as far as it can. Another trick is that if a powderhand is locked in melee combat, it can still shoot another target that is 10 feet away, negating the disadvantage of being within 5 feet of a creature.


### Loot 
Because this battle is centered around reclaiming treasure, it provides a great opportunity to award the players a treasure hoard of the appropriate level from the DMG.

#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in overcoming the pirates can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the pirates without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the pirates, but the players expend significant resources or take heavy damage in the fight.
* **50% XP:** The players defeat the captain but flee the remaining pirates.
* **10% XP:** The players flee the pirates without defeating the captain.


### Difficulty Levels
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.
