## Barroom Brawl  <br> (Player Level: 5-6)
In this encounter, the players get caught up in a pirate bar brawl, which could be the result of a failed negotiation or an unavoidable confrontation, depending on the encounter's context in your adventure.



### Encounter Context
The players could have all sorts of reasons for needing to get information from someone in a rowdy and hostile bar. Below are some possible scenarios:

| d4  | Bar Fight Setups|
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |The players are trying to glean information on a notorious pirate crew, and one of their crew is a regular at the bar and known for being loose-lipped with drinking. However, trying to speak with him risks angering other members of the crew who frequent the bar. |
|  2  | The players are looking for a ship crew, and the sailors here will need to see how well they can handle themselves in a fight before they join. |
|  3  | The players were told a pirate informant was waiting for them at the bar, but it was a trap set by the crew. It might have worked better had they not gotten drunk while waiting for the players to arrive. |
|  4  | The players were hired to capture a run-away youth who joined a pirate gang. When the players try to persuade the new pirate to come with them, the rest of the crew intervenes. |

### Lead Up
The players’ objective is to question the bar’s patrons about a sensitive subject that the pirates are reluctant to discuss with strangers. As the players begin their inquiries, the pirates may start speaking loudly, drawing the attention of the rest of the bar. At this point, it should become clear that the pirates are ready to attack. The players can either attempt to de-escalate the situation or negotiate. If these attempts fail, combat will begin.

### Pirate Tactics
The pirates in the bar are highly disorganized, creating a chaotic encounter. Tavern Smashers should charge at players whenever they get an opportunity, even if there’s a risk that a missed attack could hit another pirate.

### Resolution
There are several ways this fight can end:

**Fleeing:** If the encounter turns against the players, they can attempt to run. The pirates won’t pursue them but will warn them never to return.

**Defeat:** If the players are overwhelmed, they will wake up a short distance outside the tavern, having been thrown out.

**Victory:** If the players win, the pirates will reveal any information they have (or concede to the players' wishes if there is a different reason for the fight.)

#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in defeating the pirates can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the enemy pirates without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all their foes, but one or more of their party members are dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to defeat half the pirates but flee the rest.
* **10% XP:** The players flee after defeating less than half the pirates or lose the fight entirely.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 


**Easier Encounter (Level 5-6).** 
* Use **Barroom Brawlers** & **Tavern Smashers**
* XP Award: 1,500 XP

**Standard Encounter (Level 7-9).** 
* Replace the **Barroom Brawlers** with **Rabble Rousers** & the **Tavern Smashers** with **City Smashers**
* XP Award: 6,000 XP
