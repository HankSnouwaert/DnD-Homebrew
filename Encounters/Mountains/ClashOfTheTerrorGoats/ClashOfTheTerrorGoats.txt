## Clash of the Terror Goats <br> (Player Level: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players attempt to stop elemental terror goats from clashing along a mountainside. These goats are avatars of angry mountain spirits, and every time they but heads, the reverberations wreak havoc across the mountains. 

### Encounter Context
The players become aware of restless and angered mountain spirits through an NPC or communing with the land if one of them is a ranger or druid. Regardless of the source, they discover that these spirits have manifested as large elemental terror goats and have started dueling each other. If this dueling continues unchecked, it will trigger avalanches and devastate the entire mountainside. The players must intervene, subduing the spirits and preventing them from engaging in further conflict.


### Lead Up
The goats are extremely noisy and will pay little attention to approaching creatures, meaning the players should have no trouble locating them and can engage the goats on their own terms.

### Map Description
* **Mountainside.** The mountain slopes are made up of hard rock with varying elevations, as shown on the map. Beyond this, there are no signification map features.


### Running the Encounter
The goats are fixated on using their Ram attacks to strike each other, prioritizing this action whenever possible. They generally ignore the players unless one happens to be positioned directly between two goats or if a player has successfully grappled a goat, preventing their movement or escape. Goats may also attack players who impede their movement in other ways or somehow interfere with their ability to reach another goat, and you can use your judgment when determining if a goat will switch its attacks to a player. If there are no other goats for them to attack, they will shift their focus to attacking the nearest opponent.

The goats will generally reserve their Cranial Plating reaction for defensive use against attacks from other goats.


### Aftermath

The goats will not stop fighting until they have all been destroyed. Each time one of them hits with a Ram attack against another, there are negative ramifications the players will have to deal with down the road. The nature of these ramifications can vary depending on the context of the encounter, but the more Ram attacks the goats are able to hit with, the more severe they should become.

Below are some examples of consequences you can use.

* **Arrows:** Paths Terror Goats Will Take To Reach Each Other If Not Interrupted By The Players


<br>



&emsp;**Town In Peril.** Each ram causes landslides to bombard a nearby town the players just traveled from, causing more death and devastation.

**Falling Rocks.** Each ram increases the likelihood the players will be struck by a rockslide as they continue their mountain journey. You can increase how often you roll for random encounters and increase the number of them that are rockslides.

**Collapsing Landscape.** Each ram causes landslides that bury mountain paths and alter the landscape, increasing the DC of checks to navigate through the mountains without getting lost.

**Unearthed Monsters.** Each ram unleashes more monsters from the earth, such as gangs of earth elementals, which may pursue the players as they continue their journey.

#### Loot
After the battle, the players can harvest the remains of the terror goats for gems within their stony remains. You can use the loot tables at the end of the document to help with this. 

If the players are undertaking this mission on behalf of someone else, they may get a larger reward from their patron, for which you could use a portion of a treasure hoard of the appropriate level. How much of this treasure they receive should scale with how successful they were in preventing the goats from causing damage. You can use the XP percentages from the XP Award section to determine what percentage of their payment they should be awarded.

#### XP Award: 15,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in preventing damage caused by the terror goats can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The terror goats are only able to hit each other with Ram attacks up to 1 time throughout the encounter before being defeated.
* **100% XP:** The terror goats are able to hit each other with Ram attacks 2 or 3 times throughout the encounter before being defeated.
* **50% XP:** The terror goats are able to hit each other with Ram attacks 4 or 5 times throughout the encounter before being defeated.
* **10% XP:** The terror goats are able to hit each other with Ram attacks 6 or more times throughout the encounter.

\columnbreak

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-7).** Replace the terror goats with dire bighorn sheep. Change the XP award to 5,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 15-17).** Start the battle with 3 extra **earth elementals** who are hostile to the players. Each time a terror goat successfully hits another terror goat with a Ram attack, have another **earth elemental** burst from the ground next to a random player and roll initiative for it. Change the XP award to 25,000XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Pacifying the Spirits.** After the elemental Terror Goats are destroyed, it becomes apparent that the mountain spirits they represented are still furious. The region faces natural calamities as a manifestation of this fury - landslides, rockfalls, and dangerous shifts in weather. The adventurers must now journey to a hidden spiritual site in the mountains to perform a ritual of appeasement, while dealing with the dangerous consequences of the spirits' rage.
|  2  | **The Echoes of Impact.** The violent clashes between the elemental terror goats have caused instability in the region's ley lines - pathways of magical energy that crisscross the land. This has resulted in sporadic magical anomalies, such as spontaneous creation of minor elementals or areas where magic doesn't work as expected. The adventurers must work with local druids or mages to restore the ley lines and stop the anomalies. |
|  3  | **Goat Guardians.** An ancient tribe living in seclusion in the mountains contacts the adventurers. They believe that the Terror Goats were guardians of the mountains, keeping a far more dangerous entity sealed away. With their destruction, this entity could soon awaken. The adventurers must investigate these claims and, if true, find a way to contain the looming threat. |
|  4  | **Mountain's Bounty.** Amidst the rubble and destruction caused by the terror goats' clashes, precious minerals and artifacts from deep within the mountains have been unearthed. This has sparked a gold rush, with miners, treasure hunters, and bandits flocking to the region. The adventurers might get involved to protect the locals, claim some of the unearthed treasure for themselves, or deal a dangerous artifact that's been accidentally unearthed. |

## Goats & Sheep Tactics
Goats and sheep are generally stubborn creatures and excel in one-on-one combat due to their Cranial Plating feature. If one becomes outnumbered or its opponent gains the advantage over it, it may attempt to flee to find its herd and gain safety in numbers. Goats and sheep with a climb speed will prefer to fight and flee in rocky terrain where they have the advantage and can flee more easily if need be.

Unless directed by a more intelligent creature, goats and sheep will use their Head Bash ability every turn until they miss, after which they will revert to regular attacks. A more intelligent creature may direct them to target enemies with lower AC, increasing the likelihood of a successful hit.

### Terror Goats
Terror goats are even more belligerent, stubborn, and less intelligent than regular goats. They exhibit no fear, even when losing battles. Their malevolent nature means they will relentlessly pursue foes to the death, smashing through anything that gets in their way.


## Goat & Sheep Loot
The valuable items looted from goats and sheep will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### Goat & Sheep Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Dire Bighorn Loot Table

### Type of Loot Found
Because the creatures in this encounter are elementals, you can have the valuable goods the players recover be gems found within their stony forms. You can use the gem tables from pg. 134 of the DMG to come up with the types of gems the players harvest.
