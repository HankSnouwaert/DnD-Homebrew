## The Yeti Temple <br> (Player Level: 5-6)
In this encounter, the players find an ancient shrine dedicated to a benevolent yeti known as a meh-teh. However, the shrine has been desecrated, and they have been tasked with restoring it while surviving the wrath of the angered yeti.

### Encounter Context
The players must be aware of the shrine's state of desecration and how to appease the angered spirits within. They will likely have learned of this from monks who once cared for the shrine. This information would also include the words and hand gestures needed to perform the prayer at each of the shrine's statues to appease the spirit that the statue represents. The players may learn of this from writings left behind by the monks or by talking to them directly. 

How much the players know of the yetis within is up to you. The yetis are peaceful by nature, but the angered spirits have driven them to heightened states of aggression. Once the spirits are appeased, the yetis will cease their attack.

### Lead Up
The players arrive through the massive doors at the entrance. Any entrance into the temple will be heralded by a blast of winter air, likely preventing anyone from sneaking in. The yetis are hiding at their starting locations in a hibernating state but will awake when they hear the players and wait to launch a surprise attack when they've stepped at least 10 feet into the temple.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The temple has no light except what comes in through the opened door and the windowed areas of the walls, though the braziers can be lit.
* **Braziers.** The braziers begin unlit but can be ignited by players to provide more light to the chamber. The yetis have disadvanage on attacks made against creatures within 5 feet of a lit brazier and on all attacks they make while within 5 feet of a lit brazier.
* **Walls & Ceiling.** The temple's walls are 70 feet high, and they, along with the roof, are made of wood. The roof is supported by 4 stone pillars throughout the chamber.
* **Statues and Alters.** The statues are made of stone, and the smaller ones are 30 ft. tall, while the largest central statue is 40 ft. tall. Each alters is made of ornately carved wood and draped with cloth and furs.

### Running the Encounter
Once the fight starts, the yetis will do everything they can to repel the players as the players attempt to perform their ritual.

#### Performing the Ritual
The ritual requires the players to perform a prayer at the altar of each of the 5 statues. The prayers can be done by different players, but all must be done within 1 minute of the first prayer to complete the ritual; otherwise, it must be started again. A prayer can be done by any creature with an Intelligence of 8 or higher who can speak at least one language. It involves dropping prone within 5 feet of an altar while directly facing the statue and using an action to use both hands to perform the appropriate hand gestures while saying the prayer. 

#### The Yetis
The primary goal of the meh-teh yetis is to repel the players from the shrine or slay them trying. They try to initiate combat with a surprise attack and should have just enough movement from their start location to reach a player who has entered far enough into the temple to reach an alter.

The yetis will include a grapple attempt as part of their multiattacks, and on their next turn, bite and throw grappled creatures towards the exit or at players near the exit. They will move grappled creatures closer to the exit when possible to help accomplish this if doing so doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. 

More general yeti tactics can be found later in this document.

The yetis don't factor in who's performing prayers when choosing their targets. However, once the ritual is complete, they will retreat through the windows into the wilderness unless one of them has been killed, in which case the remaining yeti will still be hostile toward the players.


### Aftermath
If the players complete the ritual, the temple will be safe for the remaining monks to return to and restore. If the players flee, the yeti will not give chase. 

#### Loot
If the players successfully complete the ritual, they can be awarded 2d4 25gp art objects. These can be items the returning monks gift to the players for their service or items left behind in the temple if the monks are long gone. 

If the meh-teh yetis are spared, each of them will leave behind a necklace made of blessed bones and stones (worth 250gp each) as a parting gift for the players.

#### XP Award: 4,500xp
The degree of success the players have in sanctifying the shrine can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players complete the ritual without slaying any of the yetis or having any of their party reduced to 0 hit points.

\columnbreak

* **100% XP:** The players complete the ritual without slaying any of the yetis.
* **50% XP:** The players complete the ritual and slay the yetis. 
* **10% XP:** The players retreat without completing the ritual.

### Adjusting the Difficulty 
&emsp;**Easier Encounter (Level 3-4).** Remove one of the yetis. Change the XP award to 1,800 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 7-9).** Add a third meh-teh yeti. Change the XP award to 9,500 XP.
