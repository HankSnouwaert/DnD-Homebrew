## The Yeti Temple <br> (Player Level: 5-6)
In this encounter, the players find an ancient shrine dedicated to a benevolent yeti known as a meh-teh. However, the shrine has been desecrated, and they have been tasked with restoring it while surviving the wrath of the angered yeti.

### Encounter Context
The players must be aware of the shrine's state of desecration and how to appease the angered spirits within. They will likely have learned of this from monks who once cared for the shrine. This information would also include the words and hand gestures needed to perform the prayer at each of the shrine's statues to appease the spirit that the statue represents. The players may learn of this from writings left behind by the monks or by talking to them directly. 

How much the players know of the yetis within is up to you. The yetis are peaceful by nature, but the angered spirits have driven them to heightened states of aggression. Once the spirits are appeased, the yetis will cease their attack.

### Lead Up
The players arrive through the massive doors at the entrance. Any entrance into the temple will be heralded by a blast of winter air, likely preventing anyone from sneaking in. The yetis are hiding at their starting locations in a hibernating state but will awake when they hear the players and wait to launch a surprise attack when they've stepped at least 10 feet into the temple.


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The temple has no light except what comes in through the opened door and the windowed areas of the walls, though the braziers can be lit.
* **Braziers.** The braziers begin unlit but can be ignited by players to provide more light to the chamber. The yetis have disadvanage on attacks made against creatures within 5 feet of a lit brazier and on all attacks they make while within 5 feet of a lit brazier.
* **Walls & Ceiling.** The temple's walls are 70 feet high, and they, along with the roof, are made of wood. The roof is supported by 4 stone pillars throughout the chamber.
* **Statues and Alters.** The statues are made of stone, and the smaller ones are 30 ft. tall, while the largest central statue is 40 ft. tall. Each alters is made of ornately carved wood and draped with cloth and furs.

### Running the Encounter
Once the fight starts, the yetis will do everything they can to repel the players as the players attempt to perform their ritual.

#### Performing the Ritual
The ritual requires the players to perform a prayer at the altar of each of the 5 statues. The prayers can be done by different players, but all must be done within 1 minute of the first prayer to complete the ritual; otherwise, it must be started again. A prayer can be done by any creature with an Intelligence of 8 or higher who can speak at least one language. It involves dropping prone within 5 feet of an altar while directly facing the statue and using an action to use both hands to perform the appropriate hand gestures while saying the prayer. 

#### The Yetis
The primary goal of the meh-teh yetis is to repel the players from the shrine or slay them trying. They try to initiate combat with a surprise attack and should have just enough movement from their start location to reach a player who has entered far enough into the temple to reach an alter.

The yetis will include a grapple attempt as part of their multiattacks, and on their next turn, bite and throw grappled creatures towards the exit or at players near the exit. They will move grappled creatures closer to the exit when possible to help accomplish this if doing so doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. 

The yetis don't factor in who's performing prayers when choosing their targets. However, once the ritual is complete, they will retreat through the windows into the wilderness unless one of them has been killed, in which case the remaining yeti will still be hostile toward the players.

More general yeti tactics can be found later in this document.

### Aftermath
If the players complete the ritual, the temple will be safe for the remaining monks to return to and restore. If the players flee, the yeti will not give chase. 

#### Loot
If the players successfully complete the ritual, they can be awarded 2d4 25gp art objects. These can be items the returning monks gift to the players for their service or items left behind in the temple if the monks are long gone. 

If the meh-teh yetis are spared, each of them will leave behind a necklace made of blessed bones and stones (worth 250gp each) as a parting gift for the players.

#### XP Award: 4,500xp
The degree of success the players have in sanctifying the shrine can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players complete the ritual without slaying any of the yetis or having any of their party reduced to 0 hit points.

\columnbreak

* **100% XP:** The players complete the ritual without slaying any of the yetis.
* **50% XP:** The players complete the ritual and slay the yetis. 
* **10% XP:** The players retreat without completing the ritual.

### Adjusting the Difficulty 
&emsp;**Easier Encounter (Level 3-4).** Remove one of the yetis. Change the XP award to 1,800 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 7-9).** Add a third meh-teh yeti. Change the XP award to 9,500 XP.




### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Evil Within.** The temple corruption was caused by an ancient evil sealed in the chambers below that is close to escaping its bindings. The party must venture into the depths below the temple to reseal this malevolent force. |
|  2  | **The Dzu-Teh Defilers.** The act of cleansing the temple angers a nearby clan of dzu-teh yetis, who were the ones to defile it in the first place. In retaliation, they seek to lay siege to the temple and destroy it entirely. |
|  3  | **Restoring the Monastery.** The temple, now cleansed, once housed a community of monks who had to flee when the spirits were angered. The party is tasked with finding these monks and ensuring their safe return to the temple. |
|  4  | **The Desecrator's Identity.** The party discovers clues pointing to the identity of the original desecrators of the temple. They must track down those responsible and bring them to justice or learn their motivations to prevent further conflicts. |

Note that for any of these adventures, you could provide an opportunity for the players to find and ally themselves with the meh-teh yeti to accomplish their shared goals, assuming the players didn't slay them.

## Yeti Tactics

Yetis are ambush predators well adapted to moving through mountainous alpine terrain. They rely on surprise attacks in snowy or rocky environments. If their ambush is thwarted, they will retreat and attempt to sneak up on their targets later. Most yetis have a way of paralyzing their victims, rendering them helpless. However, a common weakness all yetis share is their fear of fire. Constant fire damage can deter a determined yeti, forcing it to retreat temporarily and target the individual responsible for the fire damage in future encounters.

<br><br><br>

**Meh-Teh.** Meh-teh are rarely provoked to anger, but when they are, it is for a righteous cause. They never give up on punishing those they deem guilty. Meh-teh initiate combat with an all-out attack, aiming to grapple their foes and drag them away from allies. On the next turn, their actions depend on whether the target is still grappled. If it is, they deliver a bite before attempting to throw the frozen victim into their allies for additional damage. If the target is not grappled, the meh-teh continues to attempt to grapple and bite the victim as they drag it further away. They may consider throwing grappled victims off a high cliff if possible.

## Yeti Loot
The valuable items looted from yetis will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

While yetis don't use much in the way of equipment, they may wear or keep more valuable items they’ve collected. If you’re using a yeti important to a story for a climactic battle, it is usually good to provide some high-value “art objects” from the DMG they’ve collected or crafted for players to find.

### Yeti Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

#### Meh-teh Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1 5gp Item |
|  8-10 | 1d4(2) 5gp Items | 
|  11-16 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items  |  
|  17-22 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items |  
|  23+ |  1d4(2) 20gp Items |  
 
#### Example Yeti Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.

##### Example Uncommon Yeti Item Names
|1d4 | 5gp Item | 10gp Item | 20gp Item |
