## The Stonehorn Graveyard <br> (Player Level: 16-18)
In this encounter, the players venture into the Granitetooth Graveyard, a renowned location where stone horns nearing the end of their life come to rest as they slowly die, and their bodies fully petrify into stone. The stony bodies of these mighty creatures are filled with gems they've consumed throughout their long lives. This presents an opportunity for bold treasure seekers to harvest precious stones from the rocky corpses. However, this is a risky endeavor, as some of the stonehorns are still alive and can be awakened if disturbed. Once roused, these creatures become enraged and seek to crush the intruders with single-minded determination.

To make matters worse, the graveyard is subjected to an unnatural number of severe ice storms, and as the players explore, one such storm begins to gather in the area, enveloping the graveyard in bitter cold. This storm creates time pressure as the players work to mine for as many gems as they can before the storm becomes too intense.

### Encounter Context
The players may have found this location by accident, but it's more likely they had to seek it out. They may have been hired to collect the gems here and are getting a cut of the riches they gather, or they may only be out for themselves. Either way, their goal is to gather as many gems as they can while the weather allows for it. The players should be given some clues as to the fact that this location seems to be cursed with regular ice storms of unnatural intensity. 



### Lead Up
When the players arrive at the graveyard, all is quiet, and the weather is still calm. 

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** This depends on the time of day, and there will likely be daylight at the start of the encounter. Be sure to track daylight as the players spend time at the graveyard and reduce the lighting accordingly. 
* **Terrain.** The ground is open snowy terrain, and outside of the stonehorn statues, there are no significant  features. 

### The Stonehorns
The players can attempt to examine a stonehorn to determine whether it is dead or alive. To do so, a player must spend 10 uninterrupted minutes making an Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Nature) check to determine the status of the stonehorn. Because the stonehorns are in varying states of petrifications, they have different DC for this check, as shown on the encounter map, and this check should be made by you without showing the player the result. On a failed check, the player won't be able to determine the status of the stonehorn, and if they fail the check by 5 or more, you can give them a random status.

##### Map Legend
* <font color="Red">**Red Square:** Stonehorn, Including Whether It's Alive or Dead, and the DC for Checks to Determine Its Status </font>

<br>

#### Dead Stonehorn Statues
The stonehorn statues possess the same hit points and armor class as a living stonehorn but are magical stone objects rather than creatures. These statues have immunity to poison and psychic damage, as well as resistance to all other forms of damage. They also possess the stonehorn's Stone Skeleton trait.


##### Mining Stonehorn Statues
Any number of players can engage in mining a statue to extract gems and other valuable items over the course of one or more hours. Over the course of an hour, a player working at mining exerts an amount of Effort equal to their Strength score. Players working together can combine their Effort. Once a total of 80 Effort is spent on a statue, it has been cracked open, and the gems within can be extracted. 

A player can choose to double the Effort they exert, but when they do so, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving afterward. On a failure, they suffer a level of exhaustion.

##### Stonehorn Statue Gem Yield
Stonehorns that are harvested yield the same amount of loot as still living stonehorns that are harvested. Stonehorn loot tables can be found at the end of the document. 

#### Living Stonehorns
A statue that is actually a still-living stonehorn will transform into a creature when it sustains 20 or more damage or when the players attempt to mine gems from it. The awakened stonehorn will attack using the tactics typical of a regular stonehorn (see tactics section at the end of the document for more details). It's important to note that the stonehorn's Earth-Shattering Smash ability can awaken other dormant stonehorn statues in the vicinity, bypassing their resistance and dealing double damage. 

If a stonehorn is left undisturbed and not engaged in combat for 1 minute, it will find a spot to rest and revert back to its statue form.


### The Approaching Storm
A slow-moving yet highly intense storm approaches the graveyard, posing a significant threat to everything within its path. With each passing 2-hour interval, the storm intensifies, making mining more exhausting and determining the state of the stone horns increasingly difficult. Refer to the table below to determine how the elapsed time changes the effort required to excavate a stonehorn, the Constitution saving throw DC to avoid exhaustion when mining at an accelerated pace, and the DC of the check to determine if a stonehorn is still alive.

##### Approaching Storm Effects
| Hours Passed  | Exhaustion Constitution Save DC | Effort Required to Excavate| Increase to DC When Examining Stonehorn
|:---:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|  0-2 | 16 | 90 | +1  |
|  2-4 | 17 | 100 | +2 |
|  4-6 | 18 | 110 | +3
|  6-8 | 19 | 120 | +4
|  8+ | 20 | 130 | +5

Once 9 hours pass, the storm starts dealing 3d6 cold damage to creatures every minute they spend exposed to its winds.

Each time the storm increases in severity, roll a d6. On a result of 4 or higher, a new stonehorn will arrive at the graveyard and attack the players.

### Aftermath
The encounter ends whenever the players decide to retreat from the graveyard to shelter. There is a sheltered mountain passage about a 10-minute run away from the graveyard, though players encumbered with treasure will take 20 minutes to reach it. Once they reach this passage, they can continue traveling out of the storm without taking damage.


\columnbreak





#### XP Award
For each stonehorn statue the players successfully mine, award them 10,000 XP. 



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 13-15).** Don't have any new stonehorns appear in the graveyard when the storm increases in severity. 

Reduce the XP and gems awarded per stonehorn mined by half.

**Harder Encounter (Level 18-20).** Whenever the storm increases in severity and you roll a d6 to determine if a new stonehorn arrives, the stonehorn arrives on a 3 or higher instead of a 4. Additionally, whenever a stonehorn would awaken, roll a d6. On a result of 5 or higher, the statue becomes an icehorn instead. Note that to keep the battle manageable, it's best to only have one icehorn in the battle at once unless you want to handle multiple creatures with legendary actions. 

Double the XP and gems awarded per stonehorn mined.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Granite King.** While mining the statues, the adventurers inadvertently awaken a dormant Stonehorn - the ancient Granite King. This monstrous stonehorn has rested year for decades without dying. Now awakened, it seeks to wreak havoc across the land. |
|  2  | **Gems of Winter's Wrath.** The gems extracted from the Stonehorn statues are discovered to possess a residual elemental magic, specifically ice magic. A powerful sorcerer hears of this and seeks to harness the gems' power for his own nefarious purposes, sending his minions after the adventurers to steal them. |
|  3 | **Ghosts of Granite.** Rumors circulate that the graveyard is haunted, as several adventurers have gone missing. The players are asked to investigate and encounter the spectral forms of stonehorns, furious at the desecration of their resting place. |
|  4  | **The Fossilized Egg.** The adventurers find a rare stonehorn egg fossilized in a statue. The egg begins to crack, hinting that it might be hatching soon. They must figure out what to do with it, while also dealing with those who would seek to possess such a unique creature for themselves.|

## Stonehorn Tactics
When left to its own devices, the stonehorn relies on instinct, primarily driven by its insatiable appetite for precious metals and gems, which it consumes to nourish its earthen form. Thanks to its Treasure Sense ability, it identifies and charges at the creature holding the most valuable gems and gold, aiming to slaughter them by running them over repeatedly for maximum charge damage. When faced with multiple creatures possessing equal amounts of treasure, the stonehorn prefers targets adorned with the most metal. However, it shifts its attention towards any creature inflicting substantial damage (30 or more in a single turn), directing its Earth-Shattering Smash at that particular threat. The stonehorn instinctively utilizes its Stone Plating reaction against attacks it doesn’t have resistance to and that don’t have their damage reduced by its Stone Skeleton trait.

If under the guidance of a more intelligent creature, the stonehorn strategically focuses its attention on the largest group of creatures, charging at full speed from one target to another if they are spread out. The intelligent creatures guiding the stonehorn may also instruct it to reserve its Stone Plating reaction for high-damage single attacks from enemies like Paladins or Rogues, provided those attacks have a way to bypass its resistances.

### Icehorn Tactics
The icehorn boasts a unique ability known as Glacial Stance, and understanding when to utilize this stance forms a critical part of its strategy. If the icehorn is not guided by an intelligent creature, it assumes the Glacial Stance whenever a creature comes within 20 feet, seeking to leverage the stance's higher defense.

When controlled by a more intelligent creature, the icehorn adopts the Glacial Stance whenever its enemies are reachable with melee attacks. If there are priority targets more than 20 feet away, the snow horn will exit its Glacial Stance to reach them.

The icehorn possesses two pairs of legendary actions whose use is dependent on whether it's in Glacial Stance:

**Frost Bite/Glacial Stomp:** The icehorn uses Glacial Stomp to crush a melee-range target that's drawn its attention. Conversely, Frost Bite targets solitary adversaries out of melee range, dealing moderate damage when it does not wish to waste time charging over to a new foe.

**Wild Shove/Trample:** The icehorn employs Wild Shove to position a target such that it can hit multiple creatures with its Earth-Shattering Smash or to create an escape route if it needs to withdraw from melee range. This tactic enables the Stonehorn to charge back and forth for devastating attacks without drawing opportunity attacks. Similarly, Trample is used to move toward a solitary target, stomp it, then return to the original position on its next turn for a full charge.

\columnbreak

### Stonehorn Loot
The valuable items looted from still living stonehorns will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. Because stonehorns are filled with gems are partially stone, you may also allow players to make **Wisdom (Carver's Tools)** or **Wisdom (Jeweler's Tools)** checks when harvesting them. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Stonehorn Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
