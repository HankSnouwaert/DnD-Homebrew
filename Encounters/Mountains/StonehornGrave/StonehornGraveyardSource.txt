## The Stonehorn Graveyard <br> (Player Level: 16-18)
In this encounter, the players venture into the Granitetooth Graveyard, a renowned location where stone horns nearing the end of their life come to rest as they slowly die, and their bodies fully petrify into stone. The stony bodies of these mighty creatures are filled with gems they've consumed throughout their long lives. This presents an opportunity for bold treasure seekers to harvest precious stones from the rocky corpses. However, this is a risky endeavor, as some of the stonehorns are still alive and can be awakened if disturbed. Once roused, these creatures become enraged and seek to crush the intruders with single-minded determination.

To make matters worse, the graveyard is subjected to an unnatural number of severe ice storms, and as the players explore, one such storm begins to gather in the area, enveloping the graveyard in bitter cold. This storm creates time pressure for the players as they work to mine for as many gems as they can before the storm becomes too intense.

### Encounter Context
The players may have found this location by accident, but it's more likely they had to seek it out. They may have been hired to collect the gems here and are getting a cut of the riches they gather, or they may only be out for themselves. Either way, their goal is to gather as many gems as they can while the weather allows for it. The players should be given some clues as to the fact that this location seems to be cursed with regular ice storms of unnatural intensity. 



### Lead Up
When the players arrive at the graveyard, all is quiet, and the weather is still calm. 

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** This depends on the time of day, and there will likely be daylight at the start of the encounter. Be sure to track daylight as the players spend time at the graveyard and reduce the lighting accordingly. 
* **Terrain.** The ground is open snowy terrain, and outside of the stonehorn statues, there are no significate terrain features.

### The Stonehorns
The players can attempt to examine a stonehorn to determine whether it is dead or alive. To do so, a player must spend 10 uninterrupted minutes making an Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Nature) check to determine the status of the stonehorn. Because the stonehorns are in varying states of petrifications, they have different DC for this check, as shown on the encounter map, and this check should be made by you without showing the player the result. On a failed check, the player won't be able to determine the status of the stonehorn, and if they fail the check by 5 or more, you can give them a false status.


#### Dead Stonehorn Statues
The stonehorn statues possess the same hit points and armor class as a living stonehorn but are magical stone objects rather than creatures. These statues have immunity to poison and psychic damage, as well as resistance to all other forms of damage. They also possess the stonehorn's Stone Skeleton trait.

##### Mining Stonehorn Statues
Any number of players can engage in mining a statue to extract gems and other valuable items over the course of one or more hours. Over the course of an hour, a player working at mining exerts an amount of Effort equal to their Strength score. Players working together can combine their Effort. Once a total of 80 Effort is spent on a statue, it has been cracked open, and the gems within can be extracted. 

A player can choose to double the Effort they exert, but when they do so, they must make a DC 16 Constitution saving afterward. On a failure, they suffer a level of exhaustion. 

### Aftermath
This is a fight to the death for the titanic ape and its worshippers, and they will not flee the mountain summit. If the players flee, they will give chase until the players manage to reach an area the ape can't follow. The ape invokers will be unlikely to continue the pursuit without the aid of the ape.

If the players slay the titanic ape, no new invokers will join the fight as they all flee the mountain in terror.


#### Loot
After the battle, the players will be able to enter the ape's chamber and plunder all the offerings it received from its worshippers. Because this battle is likely to be the final encounter of an adventure, it would be a good time to award the players one or two treasure hoards of the appropriate level.

#### XP Award: 30,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the titanic ape and its worshippers can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the titanic ape without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the titanic ape, but one or more of their party members were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** If the players find a way to defeat the ape without killing it or putting an end to the threat it posses for good, you can award them half the XP.
* **10% XP:** The players flee.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 10-12).** Reduce the titanic ape's hit points to 297 and have it appear three rounds after combat starts rather than one round. Additionally, don't have any new ape invokers appear throughout the battle, and seal entrances 2 and 3 on the map so they no longer function as exits. Change the XP award to 15,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 18-20).** Increase the titanic ape's hit points to 597. Additionally, have a new ape invoker appear every round after combat starts rather than every other round. Change the XP award to 45,000XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Remnants of the Cult.** While the immediate threat was neutralized, not all cultists were present at the mountain temple. The remaining members, desperate and vengeful, start gathering new followers and search for a new monstrous deity to worship and control. The adventurers must root out the rest of the cult and stop their new sinister plan. |
|  2  | **Rise of the Titans.** The titanic ape was one of many ancient monsters being awoken by the cult, and the players must track down the other locations around the world where these primordial threats are being raised to prevent them from being unleashed. |
|  3  | **The Lost City.** The battle with the titanic ape revealed the entrance to a lost city buried within the mountain. The remaining cultists have fled into this city in pursuit of their cryptic goals. |
|  4  | **Nature's Reclaim.** The awakening of the titanic ape has caused the area around the mountain temple to start growing at an unnatural rate, turning into a wild and magical jungle. The rapidly expanding jungle threatens to engulf nearby settlements and must be stopped. |

#### Mythic Titanic Ape Encounter
If you're aiming to transform a titanic ape into a formidable adversary for an intense boss battle, consider doubling its maximum hit points to a total of 597, elevating its CR to 20, and granting it the following trait:<br><br>

> ***Tantrum (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Upon reaching half its hit points (297 or less), the ape ends any spells or conditions of its choice that are currently affecting it. Simultaneously, it releases any creatures or objects it is holding and commences a ground-pounding tantrum that can last up to a minute. <br> In order to maintain this tantrum, the ape must use its action each turn to use Ferocious Roar. The tantrum ends early if it ends its turn without using Ferocious Roar, loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), or can no longer reach a solid surface with its arms.<br> While the ape is engaged in this tantrum, it gains the following effects:<br>
> * Both its hands are considered occupied.
> * It cannot use the Grasp, Throw, or Rending Bite legendary actions
> * It gains Reverberating Slam (described below) as a bonus action and a legendary action.<br><br>
> **Reverberating Slam.** Each creature within 60 feet of the titanic ape must succeed a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the ape. If the save fails by 10 or more (DC 11), the creature is pushed 20 feet away. On a successful save, the creature only takes half the damage and isn't pushed.

## Zheng Tactics
Zheng are skilled ambush predators, choosing to strike when they have the element of surprise or when their target is isolated. If they find themselves in a disadvantageous situation, they will retreat and regroup to re-engage later with the advantage. Once zheng successfully ambush their prey and enter combat, they will not hesitate to retreat if the tide of the fight turns against them. This is especially true if they fail to knock their target prone, secure them in a grapple, or if their own health drops below half.
### Mountain Breaker
Mountain breakers initiate their ambushes by using their Landslide ability on their intended prey before taking the Hide action as a bonus action. If a mountain breaker successfully hits multiple targets with its Landslide, it prioritizes attacking buried targets. It utilizes dashes and bonus action Hides to launch surprise attacks from different angles if it can stay hidden while doing so. If the combat conditions become unfavorable, the mountain breaker will retreat.
### Summit Sovereign
The summit sovereign employs most of the same tactics as the mountain shaker. However, if a target succumbs to the icy effects of its bite, the summit sovereign is more likely to remain engaged in the battle to ensure the incapacitated can be finished off.

## Zheng Loot
The valuable items looted from zheng will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### Zheng Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
