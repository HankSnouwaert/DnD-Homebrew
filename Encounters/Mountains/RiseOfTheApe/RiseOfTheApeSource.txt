## Rise of The Ape <br> (Player Level: 14-16)
In this encounter, the players are battling ape-worshipping cultists at the top of a mountain, where they are awakening the titanic ape they reverie as a living god.

### Encounter Context
This encounter works well as the final battle of a larger adventure. The players may have had to fight their way up the mountain, battling apes and ape cultists. The cult may be trying to trigger an ape-pocalypse by awakening the titanic, and this battle may be the culmination of all their efforts. 


### Lead Up
The battle takes place on the peak of the mountain, and the players arrive up the steps from the lower side of the map. The titanic ape starts hidden in an enclosed chamber up the steps to the north of the map and will appear through a massive set of doors one round after the cultists detect the players. 

### Map Description
* **The Plaza.** The battle takes place in a massive stone plaza before a massive chamber that houses the titanic ape on top of the mountain. There are large steps coming up the mountain to the south the players arrive from and even larger stairs to the north leading up to the ape's chamber. There are also two smaller doors on either side of the ape's staircase leading into smaller chambers from which more cultists can arrive. <Br> Creatures without a climb speed can attempt to climb the plaza's walls and pillars by making a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Pillars.** These ancient decorative pillars are unstable are large. They are objects with 50 hit points, an AC of 16, and resistance to all damage except for thunder and bludgeoning damage. They are immune to psychic and poison damage.<br>
When a pillar is destroyed, each creature within 10 feet of it must make a DC 17 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (creature's choice). On a failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 12), it is also buried in rubble. A buried creature is restrained, and it or another creature must use an action to make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) to free it. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone or buried. A Huge or larger creature has advantage on the saving throw. The area within 10 feet of the destroyed pillar also becomes difficult terrain.
* **Mountainside.** The sides of the mountain are extremely steep, and only creatures with a climb speed can move across them effectively. If a creature is dropped or knocked prone in this area, it will continue to fall and roll down the cliff for 100 feet off the map, taking 100 feet worth of fall damage before landing on a ledge.

* <font color="Red">**Red Shaded Area:** Steep Mountainside </font>
* <font color="Purple">**Purple Numbers:** Entrances for Invoker Reinforcements </font>
* **I:** Ape Invoker Starting Location


### Running the Encounter
The battle will start with three ape invokers chanting wildly. You can use these invokers for role-play purposes, having them taunt the players about the titanic ape and boast that nothing can stop them. On initiative count 20 of the round after the battle with the invokers starts, the titanic ape will enter the plaza through the massive double doors at the top of the map carrying a Large rock it can use with its fling ability. Have it roll for initiative for that round (if it rolls a 20 or higher, have it immediately take its turn.)


#### Titanic Ape
The titanic ape uses the same general tactics described in its own document (these can be found at the end of this document) but without wasting any time trying to scare off the players. It immediately goes all out on the first turn of combat. When choosing where to throw a player, the ape will consider throwing them into the pillars to destroy them, burying the thrown target and any nearby creatures. The ape fights to the death, driven by frenzy and without regard for the safety of its worshipers.

#### Ape Invokers 
The ape invokers are completely devoted to their titanic god and have no fear of death. They prioritize attacking players that the ape can't easily reach using javelins or targeting those who are concentrating on spells that restrain the ape. They always attempt to use their Apetagonize ability whenever possible, even if it risks being hit by the ape's Reverberating Slam right after the tantrum triggers.

***New Invokers.*** On initiative count 20 of each turn, have a new ape invoker arrive at one of the map's 4 entrances at random, then roll initiative for it (if it rolls a 20 or higher, have it immediately take its turn.)

### Aftermath
This is a fight to the death for the titanic ape and its worshippers, and they will not flee the mountain summit. If the players flee, they will give chase until the players manage to reach an area the ape can't follow. The ape invokers will be unlikely to continue the pursuit without the aid of the ape.

If the players slay the titanic ape, no new invokers will join the fight as they all flee the mountain in terror.


#### Loot
After the battle, the players will be able to enter the ape's chamber and plunder all the offerings it received from its worshippers. Because this battle is likely to be the final encounter of an adventure, it would be a good time to award the players one or two treasure hoards of the appropriate level.

#### XP Award: 30,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the titanic ape and its worshippers can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the titanic ape without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the titanic ape, but one or more of their party members were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** If the players find a way to defeat the ape without killing it or putting an end to the threat it posses for good, you can award them half the XP.
* **10% XP:** The players flee.



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 6-8).** Replace the zheng summit sovereign with a zheng mountain breaker. Change the XP award to 5,900XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 12-14).** Replace the zheng summit sovereign with two zheng mountain breakers. Change the XP award to 15,000XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Zheng's Lair:** In the aftermath of the ambush, the players discover tracks leading back to wherever the zheng came from. They must decide whether venture off the beaten path and risk more dangers to seek out its lair and more potential treasures. |
|  2  | **Territorial Shifts:** The zheng's death has left a power vacuum in the local ecosystem. Other creatures, possibly more dangerous, are now expanding into its territory, leading to unexpected encounters and new threats to nearby settlements. |
|  3  | **Zheng Revenge:** A powerful zheng, possibly a mate or kin of the slain zheng, seeks vengeance. It starts terrorizing nearby towns, causing landslides, and the party must find a way to put an end to its rampage. |
|  4  | **The Zheng Cub:** The slain zheng left behind an offspring. The baby zheng is a potential threat, but it could also be trained and become a formidable ally if the party manages to raise it. |

#### Mythic Titanic Ape Encounter
If you're aiming to transform a titanic ape into a formidable adversary for an intense boss battle, consider doubling its maximum hit points to a total of 597, elevating its CR to 20, and granting it the following trait:<br><br>

> ***Tantrum (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Upon reaching half its hit points (297 or less), the ape ends any spells or conditions of its choice that are currently affecting it. Simultaneously, it releases any creatures or objects it is holding and commences a ground-pounding tantrum that can last up to a minute. <br> In order to maintain this tantrum, the ape must use its action each turn to use Ferocious Roar. The tantrum ends early if it ends its turn without using Ferocious Roar, loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), or can no longer reach a solid surface with its arms.<br> While the ape is engaged in this tantrum, it gains the following effects:<br>
> * Both its hands are considered occupied.
> * It cannot use the Grasp, Throw, or Rending Bite legendary actions
> * It gains Reverberating Slam (described below) as a bonus action and a legendary action.<br><br>
> **Reverberating Slam.** Each creature within 60 feet of the titanic ape must succeed a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the ape. If the save fails by 10 or more (DC 11), the creature is pushed 20 feet away. On a successful save, the creature only takes half the damage and isn't pushed.

## Zheng Tactics
Zheng are skilled ambush predators, choosing to strike when they have the element of surprise or when their target is isolated. If they find themselves in a disadvantageous situation, they will retreat and regroup to re-engage later with the advantage. Once zheng successfully ambush their prey and enter combat, they will not hesitate to retreat if the tide of the fight turns against them. This is especially true if they fail to knock their target prone, secure them in a grapple, or if their own health drops below half.
### Mountain Breaker
Mountain breakers initiate their ambushes by using their Landslide ability on their intended prey before taking the Hide action as a bonus action. If a mountain breaker successfully hits multiple targets with its Landslide, it prioritizes attacking buried targets. It utilizes dashes and bonus action Hides to launch surprise attacks from different angles if it can stay hidden while doing so. If the combat conditions become unfavorable, the mountain breaker will retreat.
### Summit Sovereign
The summit sovereign employs most of the same tactics as the mountain shaker. However, if a target succumbs to the icy effects of its bite, the summit sovereign is more likely to remain engaged in the battle to ensure the incapacitated can be finished off.

## Zheng Loot
The valuable items looted from zheng will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### Zheng Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
