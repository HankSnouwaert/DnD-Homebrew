## The Zheng Ambush <br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this encounter, the players are traveling through a mountain pass where they are ambushed by a zheng who triggers a landslide in an attempt to bury them before moving in for the kill.

### Encounter Context
There is little context required for this encounter. It makes for a good random encounter during overland travel through mountainous terrain. For ways to tie it into other adventures, see Adventure Follow Ups section.

### Lead Up
The players arrive from the right side of the map as they're traveling. The zheng will try to remain hidden and ready its Landslide ability to use when all the players have come within its range.

### Map Description
* **Mountainside.** The mountainside is made up of steps with sudden elevation changes. These steps can be climbed by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Rocks & Debris.** The mountainside is littered with spots of rocks and debris that provide light obscurement and half cover to creatures and allow the zheng to use its Mask of Stone feature to hide.

### Running the Encounter
The zheng will try to wait to initiate the fight until it can catch the entire party in its landslide. The area of the map highlighted in red is the area it will target with the landslide, and it should do so once all the players are within this area.

Once the fight starts, it will mostly use the general zheng tactics described later in this document. The terrain and cliffs will allow it to use its stealth and climb speed to make hit-and-run attacks against the players, always coming in from different directions to keep them off guard.

### Aftermath
The zheng will attempt to flee if it is reduced to 25% of its health or less or if it is obviously losing the fight. Being vengeful by nature, it will likely plot a way to kill the players later. If the players flee, the zheng will make every attempt to hunt them until they escape the mountains.

If the players slay the zheng, they will be able to continue on their journey.


#### Loot
The players can harvest loot from the zheng using the loot tables described later in this document. Because this is essentially a random encounter, there likely won't be a need for much treasure beyond this.

#### XP Award: 13,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the zheng can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the zheng without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the zheng, but it manged to inflict significant damage against the party or cost them heavy resources. 
* **50% XP:** The zheng flees.
* **10% XP:** The players flee.



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 6-8).** Replace the zheng summit sovereign with a zheng mountain breaker. Change the XP award to 5,900XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 12-14).** Replace the zheng summit sovereign with two zheng mountain breakers. Change the XP award to 15,000XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Zheng's Lair:** In the aftermath of the ambush, the players discover tracks leading back to wherever the zheng came from. They must decide whether venture off the beaten path and risk more dangers to seek out its lair and more potential treasures. |
|  2  | **Territorial Shifts:** The zheng's death has left a power vacuum in the local ecosystem. Other creatures, possibly more dangerous, are now expanding into its territory, leading to unexpected encounters and new threats to nearby settlements. |
|  3  | **Zheng Revenge:** A powerful zheng, possibly a mate or kin of the slain zheng, seeks vengeance. It starts terrorizing nearby towns, causing landslides, and the party must find a way to put an end to its rampage. |
|  4  | **The Zheng Cub:** The slain zheng left behind an offspring. The baby zheng is a potential threat, but it could also be trained and become a formidable ally if the party manages to raise it. |

>
> ***Keen Sight.*** The zheng has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>

>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.  If the target is prone, the bite deals 23 (4d8+5) piercing damage instead.

If the avalanche moves through a creature's space, that creature must make a DC 17 Dexterity or Strength saving throw (creature's choice). On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone, if it fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 12) it is also buried in rubble. While buried, the creature is restrained and requires a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape, a creature has advantage on this check if it has a burrow speed. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone or buried.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Tail Whip.*** If an enemy within 10 feet of the zheng makes an attack, the zheng can impose disadvantage on the attack. If the attack misses, the zheng can make a tail attack against that creature as part of this reaction.

## Zheng Tactics
Zheng are skilled ambush predators, choosing to strike when they have the element of surprise or when their target is isolated. If they find themselves in a disadvantageous situation, they will retreat and regroup to re-engage later with the advantage. Once zheng successfully ambush their prey and enter combat, they will not hesitate to retreat if the tide of the fight turns against them. This is especially true if they fail to knock their target prone, secure them in a grapple, or if their own health drops below half.
### Mountain Breaker
Mountain breakers initiate their ambushes by using their Landslide ability on their intended prey before taking the Hide action as a bonus action. If a mountain breaker successfully hits multiple targets with its Landslide, it prioritizes attacking buried targets. It utilizes dashes and bonus action Hides to launch surprise attacks from different angles if it can stay hidden while doing so. If the combat conditions become unfavorable, the mountain breaker will retreat.
### Summit Sovereign
The summit sovereign employs most of the same tactics as the mountain shaker. However, if a target succumbs to the icy effects of its bite, the summit sovereign is more likely to remain engaged in the battle to ensure the incapacitated can be finished off.

## Zheng Loot
The valuable items looted from zheng will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

### Zheng Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
