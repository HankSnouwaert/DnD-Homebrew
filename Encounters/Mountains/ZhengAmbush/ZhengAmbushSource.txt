## The Zheng Ambush <br> (Player Level: 10-12)
In this encounter, the players are traveling through a mountain pass where they are ambushed by a zheng who triggers a landslide in an attempt to bury them before moving in for the kill.

### Encounter Context
There is little context required for this encounter. It makes for a good random encounter during overland travel through mountainous terrain. For ways to tie it into other adventures, see Adventure Follow Ups section.

### Lead Up
The players arrive from the right side of the map as they're traveling. The zheng will try to remain hidden and ready its Landslide ability to use when all the players have come within its range.

### Map Description
* **Mountainside.** The mountainside is made up of steps with sudden elevation changes. These steps can be climbed by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Rocks & Debris.** The mountainside is littered with spots of rocks and debris that provide light obscurement and half cover to creatures and allow the zheng to use its Mask of Stone feature to hide.

### Running the Encounter
The zheng will try to wait to initiate the fight until it can catch the entire party in its landslide. The area of the map highlighted in red is the area it will target with the landslide, and it should do so once all the players are within this area.

Once the fight starts, it will mostly use the general zheng tactics described later in this document. The terrain and cliffs will allow it to use its stealth and climb speed to make hit-and-run attacks against the players, always coming in from different directions to keep them off guard.

### Aftermath
The zheng will attempt to flee if it is reduced to 25% of its health or less or if it is obviously losing the fight. Being vengeful by nature, it will likely plot a way to kill the players later. If the players flee, the zheng will make every attempt to hunt them until they escape the mountains.

If the players slay the zheng, they will be able to continue on their journey.


#### Loot
The players can harvest loot from the zheng using the loot tables described later in this document. Because this is essentially a random encounter, there likely won't be a need for much treasure beyond this.
