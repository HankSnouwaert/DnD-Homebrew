## Clash of the Rams <br> (Player Level: 14-16)
In this encounter, the players attempt to stop elemental rams from clashing along a mountainside. These rams are avatars of angry mountain spirits, and every time they but heads, the reverberations wreak havoc across the mountains. 

### Encounter Context
The players become aware of restless and angered mountain spirits through an NPC or communing with the land if one of them is a ranger or druid. Regardless of the source, they discover that these spirits have manifested as large elemental goats and have started dueling each other. If this dueling continues unchecked, it will trigger avalanches and devastate the entire mountainside. The players must intervene, subduing the spirits and preventing them from engaging in further conflict.


### Lead Up
The goats are extremely noisy and will pay little attention to approaching creatures, meaning the players should have no trouble locating them and can engage the goats on their own terms.

### Map Description
* **Mountainside.** The mountain slopes are made up of hard rock with varying elevations, as shown on the map. Beyond this, there are no signification map features.


### Running the Encounter
The goats are fixated on using their Ram attacks to strike each other, prioritizing this action whenever possible. They generally ignore the players unless one happens to be positioned directly between two goats or if a player has successfully grappled a goat, preventing their movement or escape. Goats may also attack players who impede their movement in other ways or somehow interfere with their ability to reach another goat, and you can use your judgment when determining if a goat will switch its attacks to a player. If there are no other goats for them to attack, they will shift their focus to attacking the nearest opponent.

The goats will generally reserve their Cranial Plating reaction for defensive use against attacks from other goats.

In the absence of other goats or after eliminating all other goats, they will shift their focus to attacking the nearest opponent.


#### Titanic Ape
The titanic ape uses the same general tactics described in its own document (these can be found at the end of this document) but without wasting any time trying to scare off the players. It immediately goes all out on the first turn of combat. When choosing where to throw a player, the ape will consider throwing them into the pillars to destroy them, burying the thrown target and any nearby creatures. The ape fights to the death, driven by frenzy and without regard for the safety of its worshipers.

#### Ape Invokers 
The ape invokers are completely devoted to their titanic god and have no fear of death. They prioritize attacking players that the ape can't easily reach using javelins or targeting those who are concentrating on spells that restrain the ape. They always attempt to use their Apetagonize ability whenever possible, even if it risks being hit by the ape's Reverberating Slam right after the tantrum triggers.

***New Invokers.*** On initiative count 20 of every other turn after combat starts, have a new ape invoker arrive at one of the map's 4 entrances at random, then roll initiative for it (if it rolls a 20 or higher, have it immediately take its turn.)

### Aftermath
This is a fight to the death for the titanic ape and its worshippers, and they will not flee the mountain summit. If the players flee, they will give chase until the players manage to reach an area the ape can't follow. The ape invokers will be unlikely to continue the pursuit without the aid of the ape.

If the players slay the titanic ape, no new invokers will join the fight as they all flee the mountain in terror.


#### Loot
After the battle, the players will be able to enter the ape's chamber and plunder all the offerings it received from its worshippers. Because this battle is likely to be the final encounter of an adventure, it would be a good time to award the players one or two treasure hoards of the appropriate level.

#### XP Award: 30,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the titanic ape and its worshippers can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat the titanic ape without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat the titanic ape, but one or more of their party members were dropped to 0 hit points, and it was a narrow victory. 
* **50% XP:** If the players find a way to defeat the ape without killing it or putting an end to the threat it posses for good, you can award them half the XP.
* **10% XP:** The players flee.

\columnbreak

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 10-12).** Reduce the titanic ape's hit points to 297 and have it appear three rounds after combat starts rather than one round. Additionally, don't have any new ape invokers appear throughout the battle, and seal entrances 2 and 3 on the map so they no longer function as exits. Change the XP award to 15,000XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 18-20).** Increase the titanic ape's hit points to 597. Additionally, have a new ape invoker appear every round after combat starts rather than every other round. Change the XP award to 45,000XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Remnants of the Cult.** While the immediate threat was neutralized, not all cultists were present at the mountain temple. The remaining members, desperate and vengeful, start gathering new followers and search for a new monstrous deity to worship and control. The adventurers must root out the rest of the cult and stop their new sinister plan. |
|  2  | **Rise of the Titans.** The titanic ape was one of many ancient monsters being awoken by the cult, and the players must track down the other locations around the world where these primordial threats are being raised to prevent them from being unleashed. |
|  3  | **The Lost City.** The battle with the titanic ape revealed the entrance to a lost city buried within the mountain. The remaining cultists have fled into this city in pursuit of their cryptic goals. |
|  4  | **Nature's Reclaim.** The awakening of the titanic ape has caused the area around the mountain temple to start growing at an unnatural rate, turning into a wild and magical jungle. The rapidly expanding jungle threatens to engulf nearby settlements and must be stopped. |

#### Mythic Titanic Ape Encounter
If you're aiming to transform a titanic ape into a formidable adversary for an intense boss battle, consider doubling its maximum hit points to a total of 597, elevating its CR to 20, and granting it the following trait:<br><br>

> ***Tantrum (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Upon reaching half its hit points (297 or less), the ape ends any spells or conditions of its choice that are currently affecting it. Simultaneously, it releases any creatures or objects it is holding and commences a ground-pounding tantrum that can last up to a minute. <br> In order to maintain this tantrum, the ape must use its action each turn to use Ferocious Roar. The tantrum ends early if it ends its turn without using Ferocious Roar, loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), or can no longer reach a solid surface with its arms.<br> While the ape is engaged in this tantrum, it gains the following effects:<br>
> * Both its hands are considered occupied.
> * It cannot use the Grasp, Throw, or Rending Bite legendary actions
> * It gains Reverberating Slam (described below) as a bonus action and a legendary action.<br><br>
> **Reverberating Slam.** Each creature within 60 feet of the titanic ape must succeed a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the ape. If the save fails by 10 or more (DC 11), the creature is pushed 20 feet away. On a successful save, the creature only takes half the damage and isn't pushed.

## Titanic Apes Tactics
Titanic apes may first attempt to use their Ferocious Roar to scare off opponents. If unsuccessful, they will charge into the battle, primarily using Slam if they can hit two or more targets, or Bite if they can only reach a single target. They may throw creature's they've grappled if they want to remove them from the fight for a bit, or if there's a large height they can be thrown from.

**Legendary Actions.** If the titan ape manages to grapple a target, it will use Rending Bite on the grappled target and then throw it. If a target escapes its grapple, the ape will attempt to grapple the target again, then throw it, and finally attempt to grapple a different target on its next turn.

While not highly intelligent, titan apes are smart enough to differentiate between enemies who can deal damage from a distance and those who need to be in melee. They strategically use their grapple to control the battlefield, potentially flinging a grappled melee attacker far away or toward another ranged enemy. They also line up players for multi-target Slam attacks.

**Mythic Encounter.** In the mythic version, the Titan Ape loses all tactical instincts during its tantrum, blindly charging toward the closest foe.





## Ape Loot

The valuable items looted from apes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Apes don’t provide quite as much quality harvesting materials as other beasts, but because giant apes and titanic apes are more intelligent, they may wear or keep more valuable items they’ve collected. If you’re using a giant or titanic ape in a climactic battle, it is usually good to provide some high-value “art objects” from the DMG they’ve collected for players to find. 


#### Ape Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
