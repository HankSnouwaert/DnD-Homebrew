## Forest of Despair <br> (Player Level: 6-8)
In this encounter, the players are exploring a dark forest where they find a sinister stag construct accompanied by eerie ravens who seek to lure the travelers to their doom.

### Encounter Context
This works well as a random encounter for the players while traveling through a sinister forest. Alternatively, the players may have been tasked with tracking down the wicked stag.

### Lead Up
The stag (a hiiden hirvi) will charge at the players as soon as it detects them. The nature of the terrain will make an ambush from either side unlikely, though the ravens will stay out of sight among the trees until combat starts.


### The Stag (Hiiden Hirvi)
The signature tactic of the hiiden hirvi is to wear down foes while goading them into pursuit. The hiiden hirvi will attempt to move up the stairs, luring its victim along with it. Below are a few things to keep in mind when the hirvi is being pursued.
* Ensure that the pursuer is ending its turn in the hirvi's aura.
* Don't engage in melee combat with a target that's a more formidable melee fighter; such targets should be drawn into pursuit.
* If a target not under the influence of Luring Chase is catching up with the hirvi, use a charge attack to try and knock it prone before retreating out of range.

### The Ravens (Sorrow Carriers)
The sorrow carriers are drawn to the despair that surrounds the hiiden hirivi and are interested in spreading their sorrow among all the creatures near it. Their behavior in combat is generally predictable and follows the following order:

* Start by inflicting the initial transgressor (usually the creature at the forefront of a group) with sorrow.
* Work your way through the group, inflicting everyone with sorrow.
* Once everyone is inflicted with sorry, focus on the nearest creature suffering from disadvantage caused by the specific type of sorrow the carrier spreads.

### Ending the Encounter
The hiiden hirvi will attempt to escape if it drops to 25 HP or less. Each of the sorrow carriers will attempt to flee if they're dropped to 17 HP or less or if the hiiden hirvi is destroyed. 

If the players flee, the hiiden hirvi (along with the sorrow carriers) will likely continue to stalk them through the woods and attempt an ambush against them when they least suspect it.

### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what can be harvested from the remains of the constructs. As this is likely a random encounter, there won't be a need for much loot beyond this. 

### XP Award: 12,000xp 
(NOTE: This is a Deadly encounter for players at level 7)

The degree of success the players have in defeating the bale wolves can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the enemies and destroy the hiiden hirivi without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the enemies, but the hiiden hirivi escapes, or one or more of the players was dropped to 0 hit points. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to defeat the sorrow carriers but flee the hiiden hirvi.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating hiiden hirvi or all of the sorrow carriers.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 4-5).** Remove the sorrow carriers. Change the XP award to 2,900 XP. (NOTE: This is deadly for level 4 players)

**Harder Encounter (Level 12-14).** Add a second hiiden hirvi. Change the XP award to 18,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to make this part of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Echoes of Ancient Magic:** The adventurers learn that the hiiden hirvi and sorrow carriers are bound by ancient magic to protect or conceal something within the forest. Their mission becomes a quest to uncover this ancient secret. |
|  2  | **Awakening the Ancient Artificer:** The death of the hiiden hirvi and sorrow carriers awakens an ancient artificer or a spirit that created or was bound to them. This entity could either seek vengeance for the destruction of its creations or express gratitude if it wished to see its threat ended. |
|  3  | **Trail of Frozen Shadows:** With the hiiden hirvi defeated, a previously obscured path in the dark forest becomes visible, leading to a hidden valley where the malevolent entities that created the hiiden hirvi reside. |
|  4  |**The Sorrow Wells:** While investigating the locations where the sorrow carriers disposed of collected sorrow, the adventurers discover wells of condensed emotional energy. These sites, now unguarded, pose a risk of corrupting the surrounding area or being exploited by dark forces. The party must find a way to neutralize these wells or safeguard them against misuse. |
