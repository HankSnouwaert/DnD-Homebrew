## Forest of Despair <br> (Player Level: 6-8)
In this encounter, the players are exploring a dark forest where they find a sinister stag construct accompanied by eerie ravens who seek to lure the travelers to their doom.

### Encounter Context
This works well as a random encounter for the players while traveling through a sinister forest. Alternatively, the players may have been tasked with tracking down the wicked stag.

### Lead Up
The stag (a hiiden hirvi) will charge at the players as soon as it detects them. The nature of the terrain will make an ambush from either side unlikely, though the ravens will stay out of sight among the trees until combat starts.


### The Stag (Hiiden Hirvi)
The signature tactic of the hiiden hirvi is to wear down foes while goading them into pursuit. The hiiden hirvi will attempt to move up the stairs, luring its victim along with it. Below are a few things to keep in mind when the hirvi is being pursued.
* Ensure that the pursuer is ending its turn in the hirvi's aura.
* Don't engage in melee combat with a target that's a more formidable melee fighter; such targets should be drawn into pursuit.
* If a target not under the influence of Luring Chase is catching up with the hirvi, use a charge attack to try and knock it prone before retreating out of range.

### The Ravens (Sorrow Carriers)
The sorrow carriers are drawn to the despair that surrounds the hiiden hirivi and are interested in spreading their sorrow among all the creatures near it. Their behavior in combat is generally predictable and follows the following order:

* Start by inflicting the initial transgressor (usually the creature at the forefront of a group) with sorrow.
* Work your way through the group, inflicting everyone with sorrow.
* Once everyone is inflicted with sorry, focus on the nearest creature suffering from disadvantage caused by the specific type of sorrow the carrier spreads.

### Ending the Encounter
The hiiden hirvi will attempt to escape if it drops to 25 HP or less. Each of the sorrow carriers will attempt to flee if they're dropped to 17 HP or less or if the hiiden hirvi is destroyed. 

If the players flee, the hiiden hirvi (along with the sorrow carriers) will likely continue to stalk them through the woods and attempt an ambush against them when they least suspect it.

### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what can be harvested from the remains of the constructs. As this is likely a random encounter, there won't be a need for much loot beyond this.

### XP Award: 5,000xp 
The degree of success the players have in defeating the bale wolves can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the enemies and destroy the hiiden hirivi without taking much damage or expending many resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the enemies, but the hiiden hirivi escapes, or one or more of the players was dropped to 0 hit points. 
* **50% XP:** The players manage to defeat the sorrow carriers but flee the hiiden hirvi.
* **10% XP:** The players flee without defeating hiiden hirvi or all of the sorrow carriers.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 4-5).** Remove the sorrow carriers. Change the XP award to 2,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 12-14).** Add a second hiiden hirvi. Change the XP award to 8,000 XP.



### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to make this part of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Echoes of Ancient Magic:** The adventurers learn that the hiiden hirvi and sorrow carriers are bound by ancient magic to protect or conceal something within the forest. Their mission becomes a quest to uncover this ancient secret. |
|  2  | **Awakening the Ancient Artificer:** The death of the hiiden hirvi and sorrow carriers awakens an ancient artificer or a spirit that created or was bound to them. This entity could either seek vengeance for the destruction of its creations or express gratitude if it wished to see its threat ended. |
|  3  | **Trail of Frozen Shadows:** With the hiiden hirvi defeated, a previously obscured path in the dark forest becomes visible, leading to a hidden valley where the malevolent entities that created the hiiden hirvi reside. |
|  4  |**The Sorrow Wells:** While investigating the locations where the sorrow carriers disposed of collected sorrow, the adventurers discover wells of condensed emotional energy. These sites, now unguarded, pose a risk of corrupting the surrounding area or being exploited by dark forces. The party must find a way to neutralize these wells or safeguard them against misuse. |

The nearest humanoid creature within 100 feet of the sorrow carrier must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) psychic damage and becoming overcome with sorrow on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one without becoming overcome with sorrow. A creature overcome with sorrow has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks if another creature is within 5 feet of it and isn't incapacitated. A creature can take an action to make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check, ending the sorrow on a success.

> ***Aura of Numbing.*** The hirvi sheds dim light out to 20 feet. Creatures that regain hit points within the light regain only half that amount. Any creature that ends its turn in the light must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (3d4) cold damage and gains a level of exhaustion, and on a success, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. Creatures immune to cold damage are immune to this aura's effects.
>
> ***Charge.*** If the hirvi moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ***Ice Walk.*** The hirvi can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check, and icy surfaces can't cause it to fall prone. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Gore.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage.

> 
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Luring Chase (3/Day).*** The hirvi targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with hunting the hirvi until the hirvi uses this ability again. An obsessed creature knows the hirvi's location if they are on the same plane of existence and cannot be slowed by exhaustion. If the target is more than 10 feet away from the hirvi, it must move on its turn toward the hirvi by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet, and can then take the rest of its turn as normal. The creature doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain or whenever it takes damage from a source other than the hirvi, the target can repeat the saving throw. An obsessed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully saves is immune to this hirvi's Luring Chase for 24 hours.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Back Kick.*** If a creature makes an opportunity attack against the hirvi, the hirvi may make a Hooves attack against the creature with disadvantage after the attack.

### Hirvi Loot

The valuable items looted from hirvi will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Hirvi Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
