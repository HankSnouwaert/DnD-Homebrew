## Eagle of The Apocalypse  <br> (Player Level: 20)
In this encounter, the players face the dreaded Lapp Eagle as it emerges from the underworld into the mortal realm over a frozen battlefield, ready to serve as a harbinger of the apocalypse. 

### Lead Up
This encounter works well at the end of a campaign, as it may prove difficult even for a group of level 20 characters. In such a campaign, the eagle may act as an instrument of doom who's been summoned by a major overarching villain. 

### Lead Up
The players arrive at the ancient frozen battlefield, which serves as the crossing point for the Lapp Eagle to enter the world. As the players approach, a storm cloud will appear in the sky 120 feet above the ground at the location of the E on the map, at which point the eagle will attack.


### The Lapp Eagle's Tactics

The Lapp Eagle possesses formidable physical prowess, but its primary objective is to deploy the army it carries. It strategically avoids direct combat unless necessary, focusing instead on effectively using its abilities and spells from a distance.

**Long-Range Engagement:** When more than 120 feet away from the enemy, the eagle uses the following tactics:
* It targets three or more deadly enemies or any serious threat that has been incapacitated by its Dread Screech ability using its once-per-day spells.
* If no significant threats are present, or if potential targets are not adequately clustered, it casts *firewall* unless already concentrating on another spell; otherwise, it opts for *lightning bolt*.
* The eagle frequently uses its Bladed Feather legendary action to disrupt spellcasters and ranged attackers in the backline.

**Close-Range Combat:** If an enemy engages in melee or if the lapp soldiers are quickly being neutralized, the eagle employs the following tactics:
* The eagle shifts to using its talons and beak for direct attacks, focusing on the most significant threats or exploiting paralyzed targets to maximize damage.
* If three or more lapp soldiers are within 30 feet of each other, the eagle may reposition to provide them tactical advantages, such as allowing soldiers to benefit from enemies being restrained by its talons or branded by its beak.

* **E:** Lapp Eagle Starting Location 

<br>

* If fewer than two soldiers are available and no safe landing spots are present, the eagle may grasp an enemy and fly upward. On the following turn, it will ascend as high as possible, attack, and then drop the enemy to inflict maximum fall damage—unless it notes the enemy has resistance to bludgeoning damage.

**Strategic Use of Soldiers:**
* The eagle reserves its Ghastly War Cry for when four or more lapp soldiers can strike effectively or when multiple soldiers can target a paralyzed enemy.
* Lapp soldiers prioritize enemies that are restrained, branded, or paralyzed by the eagle to enhance their combat effectiveness.

### Ending the Encounter
The Lapp Eagle will not retreat, nor will any of its soldiers, and will fight to the death. If the players flee, the eagle will continue its path of destruction across the world.

### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what can be harvested from the remains of The Lapp Eagle. As this is likely a climactic encounter near the end of a campaign, you could have The Lapp Eagle contain an entire treasure hoard worth of magic items and other valuables within itself that it carried out from The Underworld.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with four 20th-level players. If there are more than four players or you wish to make the encounter even more difficult, you can give the Lapp Eagle access to its lair actions.

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you wish to make this part of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Signs in the Sky:** The campaign begins with the adventurers witnessing a rare celestial event—an ominous red comet streaking across the sky, believed to herald the arrival of the Lapp Eagle. As natural disasters start occurring with alarming frequency, the adventurers must investigate ancient sites and decode celestial alignments to predict the Eagle's point of entry into the mortal realm. |
|  2  | **The Lost Forge:** Legend tells of a forge where the Lapp Eagle was originally created. Believing it contains the key to subduing the eagle, the adventurers must locate this mythical forge, now hidden in a realm filled with constructs and traps. Here, they can find the weapons or artifacts necessary to stand a chance against the Eagle. |
|  3  | **Alliance of the Desperate:** Knowing they cannot face such a foe alone, the adventurers must forge alliances with various factions, including kingdoms that might normally be rivals. These diplomatic missions involve proving the threat is real and convincing these groups to lend their armies and mages for the fight against the underworld forces that will be following the eagle. |
|  4  |**The Doomsday Cult:** A doomsday cult has deciphered ancient texts revealing how to summon the Lapp Eagle, believing its arrival will purify the world by ushering in an apocalypse. The adventurers must track the cult to their hidden sanctuary in the icy wilderness and ultimately confront the Eagle if the ritual succeeds. |

> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The eagle makes two attacks: one with its talons and one with its beak.
>
> ***Beak.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d8 + 10) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it is branded for the next minute. While branded, the target loses any resistance to fire damage, and the first time each turn it takes fire damage, it takes an extra 11 (2d10) fire damage. The creature can make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn to end the effect. Any effect that removes a level of exhaustion also removes the brand.
>
> ***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (4d6 + 10) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 26). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and cannot use teleportation or interplanar travel, takes 11 (2d10) lightning damage at the end of its turns, and the eagle cannot use its talons on another target.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Ghastly War Cry (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** Each lapp soldier within 300 feet of the eagle that can hear it can make a melee weapon attack as a bonus action until the start of the eagle's next turn.
>
> ***Dread Screech.*** Each creature of the eagle's choice that is within 300 feet of the eagle and can hear it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature can't cast spells other than cantrips. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more, it is also paralyzed until the fear ends. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the eagle's Dread Screech for the next 24 hours.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> 
> The eagle can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The eagle regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
> 
> ***Blade Rush.*** The eagle may move up to 20 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. It is unaffected by difficult terrain and can pass through walls created by spells during the movement. At the end of this movement, each creature and object that isn’t being worn or carried within 5 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage.
> 
> ***Check.*** The eagle makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
> 
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the eagle is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
> 
> ***Bladed Feather.*** The eagle flaps its wings violently, sending one of its metal feathers at a point it can see within 300 feet of it. The point must be more than 30 feet away from the eagle. Each creature within 5 feet of the point must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) fire damage. A lapp soldier appears in the nearest unoccupied space to the point. Lapp soldiers created this way take their turns after the eagle on each round, one after another. The eagle can have up to 100 Soldiers summoned by this ability at one time. (NOTE: Only costs one legendary action?)

### The Lapp Eagle's Lair

Though the Lapp Eagle doesn't have a traditional lair, you can have an otherworldly storm with a 300-foot area centered on the eagle wherever it goes, which can act as its lair. 

While in its lair, the Lapp Eagle's challenge rating is 30 and is worth 155,000 XP.

The storm possesses an Intelligence of 18 and autonomously acts in the eagle's best interest. It is sentient and knows the location of any creature within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can invoke one of the following magical effects; the same effect cannot be used consecutively:

* **Thunderous Command:** A resounding thunderclap fills the air. The lair selects any number of lapp soldiers that can hear the clap. Each chosen soldier can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and then make one melee weapon attack.
* **Lightning Conduit:** A bolt of lightning strikes down from the storm at a designated point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Any creature, other than a lapp soldier, within 5 feet of a lapp soldier at this point has disadvantage on the saving throw.
* **Gust of Cinders:** A searing gust of wind sweeps through the area. Each creature within the storm takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. Creatures attempting concentration saves due to this damage do so with disadvantage. Additionally, the wind disperses gases and vapors.

### Lapp Eagle Loot
Because infernal destroyers are constructs, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tools), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Lapp Eagle Loot Table
The following table describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Lapp Eagle Loot Table
