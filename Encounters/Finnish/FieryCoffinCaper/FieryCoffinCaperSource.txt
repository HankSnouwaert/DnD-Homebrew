## The Fiery Coffin Caper <br> (Player Level: 5-6)
In this encounter, the players attempt to retrieve an artifact from a chamber filled with fiery traps. But, when they grab the artifact, flaming cat constructs awaken to attack them as they try to make their escape.

### Encounter Context
Below are some possible setups for this encounter.
* The players were hired to collect an artifact from a long-lost reliquary.
* The players are here to collect an item needed as part of a larger adventure.
* The players happened upon the chamber while traveling in the wilderness which contains a potentially useful magic item.

### Lead Up
When the players first enter the chamber, the cats are inactive, and the flame traps are active, though easy to spot. The cats won't attack until the players have taken the item.


### The Flame Trap
This magical trap spreads throughout a room filled with 5' x 5' tiles. It activates when a Small or larger creature moves across specific tiles. Triggered tiles emit a jet of flame that extends from the tile to the ceiling. Any creature within the flame's area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failure and half as much on a success. Each activated tile becomes inactive for one minute before it can trigger again.

The trap is designed to be obvious to players, with a passive Perception score of 13 revealing faint scorch marks on both the floor and ceiling. A DC 13 Investigation check allows a character to identify which tiles are safe to traverse. The trap serves as a dynamic challenge, particularly when players are under pressure to escape the cats in a hurried escape.

### The Coffin
&emsp;**Description:** Elevated 5 feet above the ground on an altar, this wooden coffin is securely bolted down and latched shut. Picking the coffin's lock requires a DC 13 Thieves' Tools check. The lock has an AC of 13, 10 hit points, and a damage threshold of 10.

**Contents:** Within the coffin rests a skeleton clutching the object the players are after. Removing the object from the coffin or attempting to move or destroy the coffin triggers a trap: all torches within the tomb ignite, and the coffin bursts into flames, summoning 2 hiisi's cats at any of the starting locations shown on the map. The magical fire consuming the coffin lasts for one hour and can only be extinguished by magic, specifically by spells of 4th level or higher that create water or wind.

&emsp;**Summoning Mechanism:** If a hiisi's cat perishes while the flame is active, it is immediately resurrected within 5 feet of the coffin's fire.

**Detection and Understanding:**
A successful DC 17 Investigation check reveals the presence of a trap linked to the removal of the item from the coffin.
A DC 21 Investigation check uncovers the precise mechanics of the summoning trap, including details about the creatures it summons. However, there is no way to disable it.

### The Hiisi Cats
When the cats are created, the object the players took becomes their bound object, and they will stop at nothing to prevent it from being taken. Their primary strategy involves attacking the individual in possession of the object and using their claws to inflict a curse. If the cursed individual drops the item, a cat will seize the opportunity to grab the object and attempt to return it to the coffin. When engaged in combat, the cats will quickly close the gap on players to prevent their escape and leverage their Scrape reaction to make escape hazardous. 

### Ending the Encounter
The hiisi cats cannot leave the chamber to pursue the players. If the players drop the item, the cats will bring it back near the coffin. One hour after the coffin trap has been activated, it will magically reset, causing the coffin to return to its previous state with the cats hidden within. If the item is within the chamber, it will be teleported back into the coffin where it was before.

### Loot
The hiisi cat's likely can't be looted because they continually regenerate within the coffin. If the players find a way to destroy the coffin and the cats, you can use their loot tables found later in the document to determine what the players can harvest from them. 

### XP Award: 4,000xp 
If the players find a way to go above and beyond (such as destroying the coffin), you can award them 50% more XP. If they perform poorly in some way but still get the item, you can reduce the XP by 50%.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 3-4).** Reduce the number of hiisi cats the coffin creates to 1. Change the XP award to 1,200 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 7-9).** Increase the number of hiisi cats the coffin creates to 3. Change the XP award to 7,000 XP.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to make this part of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Curse of Flame:** After retrieving the artifact, the adventurers discover it is cursed, or its removal has unleashed a curse upon them. The curse could manifest as a vulnerability to fire, attracting fiery creatures, or causing them to emanate heat, endangering both themselves and their surroundings. |
|  2  | **The Pyre Cult's Vendetta:** The act of taking the artifact has drawn the ire of a cult that worships elemental fire and believes the artifact is sacred to their deity. The cult views the adventurers as desecrators and swears vengeance. |
|  3  | **The Awakening Fire:** The removal of the artifact from its chamber awakens an ancient, slumbering entity linked to fire, such as a phoenix, a fire giant king, or an elemental lord. This entity either seeks the return of the artifact or to gain the aid of the adventurers for a larger quest. |
|  4  |**Legacy of the Elements:** The adventurers learn that the artifact is part of a set of elemental relics, each guarded by constructs similar to the flaming cats but themed around water, earth, air, and perhaps even more obscure elements.  |
