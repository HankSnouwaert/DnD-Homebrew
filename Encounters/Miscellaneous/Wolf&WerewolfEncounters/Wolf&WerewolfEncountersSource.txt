# Wolf & Werewolf Encounters

## The Hounded Wagon <br> (Player Level: 3-5)
In this encounter, the players find themselves protecting a broken-down wagon under attack by desperate and opportunistic wolves. 

### Encounter Context
The wagon is being pulled by a **draft horse** and piloted by a pair of traveling merchants (**nobles**) who are taking a seldom-used trade route through a dangerous frontier. They have likely brought the players along for added protection, but you may instead have the players stumble upon the wagon if they are traveling separately on foot. The region consists of snowy, forested foothills, and the wagon has lost a wheel, forcing the merchants to stop and unload it as they attempt repairs while the sun sets. 

### Lead Up
It’s been an unusually harsh winter, and the food-deprived **wolves** in the area are becoming more aggressive in their hunt for food. The wolves spot the wagon, and attempt to sneak up on it from all sides. If one of the players spots them, their characters will have a moment to ready themselves. Otherwise, the wolves will sneak up until they appear at the locations shown on the encounter map, at which point they will rush in at the surprised travelers.

When this occurs, you can read the following description:

> ##### Encounter Start Description
> You see glowing eyes in the dark everywhere you look. Soon gleaming fangs and snarling faces appear as wolves close in around you from all sides. The merchants gasp and make for their wagon, shouting: “Drive them off! Protect our goods, and we’ll pay ya! Promise!” The horse lets out a panicked neigh as the wolves move in, looking for a vulnerable target.  

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The wagon has several torches about it. Everything within 20 feet of the wagon is brightly lit, and dim light stretches out another 20 feet.
* **The Ground.** The clearing with the wagon is mostly open terrain, and the snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement. The area with the wagon is on a lower elevation than the surrounding edges of the map, which slopes down towards the center.
* **Trees.** The smaller or isolated trees provide half cover to any creatures behind them. The larger groups of trees provide three-quarters cover.

##### Map Legend
* **W:** Wolf Arrival Area

<br><br>

* **Ledges.** The rocky ledges provide about a 10-foot drop from the outside towards the center.
* **Wagon.** The wagon blocks line of sight to creatures in it and provides three-quarters cover against creatures attacking from the outside in. It provides total cover for creatures on opposite sides of it.

### Running Combat

The wolves will charge the wagon in an attempt to spook their newfound prey into running. If nobody runs, they will attempt to gang up on any player who is apart from the rest of the group. If the players all stay grouped up in or around the wagon, a pair of wolves will close in on the panicked horse in an attempt to score an easy kill. If a player exits the wagon to intervene, other wolves will surround that player and attempt to bring them down with trip attacks and pack tactics.

Any wolf that is reduced to half its hit points or less will attempt to flee for its life. Once half the pack is dead or fleeing, the remainder will flee as well.

\pagebreakNum

#### The Merchants

The two merchants are each armed with daggers but will hide inside the wagon while they wait for the players to drive off the wolves. They will only attack wolves who threaten the wagon. If they see their horse come under attack, they will shout at the players to intervene.

If you wish to add a complication to combat, you can have one of the merchants hop onto the horse and release it from the wagon so he can make a break for safety. If he manages to ride off, the wolf pack will begin pursuing him and eventually catch up and kill him and his horse if the players don’t intervene.

#### The Horse

The horse is latched to the cart, which currently can’t be pulled. This leaves the horse unable to move from its location, so it will do nothing but use hoof attacks at any wolf that comes near. If the horse is released from the wagon, it will make a run for it, and the entire pack will chase after it, eventually catching and killing it.


### Aftermath
If the merchants and their horse survive the encounter, the grateful merchants will gift each player 10 gold pieces or 10gp worth of supplies from their wagon. If one of the merchants dies, the remaining merchant will be badly shaken and not offer the players any reward. If both merchants die, but the players manage to bring the wagon to its destination, their business partner will demand the wagon’s contents as compensation for the inconvenience of his associates’ deaths. If the horse dies, the players will receive no reward from the merchants, and they will likely have to abandon the wagon to walk the rest of the journey.

#### XP Award: 1,000xp
The degree of success they had in defending the caravan can affect the XP the players receive. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.


\columnbreak



* **150% XP:** Wolves driven off and everyone survives mostly unscathed
* **100% XP:** Wolves driven off but the horse or one of the merchants fled or was badly wounded
* **50% XP:** Wolves driven off but the horse or one or more of the merchants was killed
* **10% XP:** The horse and both merchants were killed

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficult accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Change the encounter to 4 wolves. Change the XP Award to 450.

**Harder Encounter.** Replace the wolves with dire wolves. Change the XP Award to 2,300.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

|  3  | A hag has cursed the lands, starving off most of the wolves’ typical prey, which has resulted in them aggressively hunting humanoids. |
|  4  | When the players arrive at the trading post they were traveling to, they find it ransacked and abandoned. Further investigation reveals wolf paw prints all about the structure. |

## Howling Madness <br> (Player Level:6-8)
In this encounter, the players find themselves being hunted by an ascendant packleader who has been corrupted by an eldritch artifact hidden in the woods.

### Encounter Context
The encounter focuses on an eldritch artifact hidden away deep in the woods, which has driven the ascendant packleader who dwells there mad. The packleader now leads its pack of wolves through these twisted wilds, hunting and killing everything in sight.
The players will know something is corrupting the wilds and may have heard tales of a monstrous wolf leading its pack on a murderous rampage. They should not know that the corruption is being caused by the artifact. 

If you wish this to be part of a larger adventure, you could have the players face more kinds of twisted woodland monsters as they try to find the source of the corruption. The packleader may even be hunting them as they travel, and the artifact revives it at its location each time it is defeated.

### Lead Up

As the players approach the artifact’s location, the packleader will close in to protect the source of the corruption. The artifact will sense when the player’s approach, regardless of how stealthy they are, and will summon the packleader to its defense. 

When the players approach from the bottom edge of the battle map, the packleader will close in with its pack and attempt to stealthily encircle the players. This will include a pair of wolves attempting to sneak around and move in from behind. The tokens on the map show the general areas they will attempt to approach from. Once one or more are spotted or are within striking distance, they will all attack.


When this occurs, you can read the following description:

> ##### Encounter Start Description
> Emerging from the forest around you, multiple wolves close in from all directions. Leading the pack is an unnaturally large wolf that seems to be made of writhing shadows with a pair of eyes giving off a maddening green glow. Through the trees, you can see something else is also giving off a faint green glow.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The artifact sheds dim light out to 10 feet. Everything else is obscured by darkness.
* **The Ground.** The ground between trees is mostly clear terrain. The snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement, and there are no significant slopes
* **Trees and Bushes.** The bushes are very dense, and moving 5 feet through them costs 15 feet of movement. The lone trees provide three-quarters cover, and the tree clusters provide full cover.

##### Map Legend
* **P:** Player Arrival Location
* **W:** Wolf Arrival Location
* **L:** Pack Leader

### Running Combat

The packleader and its wolves will make preventing the players from reaching the artifact their priority. Any player that approaches it will be swarmed by as many available wolves as possible.

The packleader can use its Bark Order to facilitate moving wolves out of losing fights and help them surround and neutralize fragile or troublesome players. But, most of all, it uses it to help wolves catch up and close in on any creature approaching the artifact. If the entire party is closing in on the artifact, it will use its Hunter’s Howl to attempt to drive them away and have its wolves give chase.


#### The Artifact

The item causing the madness looks like a crystal ball radiating unnatural greenish light. Any creature, other than the packmaster or its wolves, that comes within 10 feet of it for the first time on its turn or starts its turn within 10 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be subjected to the *confusion* spell until the end of its next turn.

The artifact has 50 HP, an AC 15, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If it is destroyed, the green glow will vanish from the eyes of the packleader, who will then cease attacking the players and attempt to flee, taking its wolves with it.

#### Retreat
So long as the artifact remains intact, the packleader will fight to the death. The wolves will fight on as long as the packleader remains in the fight. If it flees, the wolves will flee with it. If it dies, any wolf that doesn’t outnumber its immediate foes or is below half its hit points will flee.

### Aftermath
If the players destroy the artifact, the curse of madness on the woods will end. The golden stand on which the artifact was sitting is carved with intricate and disturbing eldritch patterns but is not magical and will fetch about 100gp on the open market. 

If the packleader is cleared of corruption and survives, it will leave a parting gift in the players’ path as they leave the woods. The players will find a wooded flute with a wolf’s head carved at the end. A player that picks it up will instantly know how it works. Anyone who uses an action to play it will cause it to emit a wolf’s howl, which summons 4 wolves as though summoned by the *conjure animals* spell. Once the flute is used this way, it loses all its magical properties, which the players should be aware of when they receive it. 



#### XP Award: 3,000xp
The degree of success they had in ending the source of the madness can affect the XP the players receive. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The artifact was destroyed, and the packleader survived
* **100% XP:** The artifact and the packleader were both destroyed
* **50% XP:** The packleader was destroyed, but the players failed to locate or destroy the artifact
* **10% XP:** The players didn’t destroy the packleader or the artifact

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficult accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Remove the two wolves circling around from behind. Change the XP Award to 2,500.

**Harder Encounter.** Change the wolves to dire wolves and add 2 more. Change the XP Award to 4,800.

|  3  | The orb was placed in the woods by a delusional prince who believed it contained a gateway to a divine being he came to see as his beloved. He seeks to rebuild the orb and exact vengeance on the players for interfering with his beloved’s wishes. |
|  4  | Within twenty-four hours of being destroyed, the artifact reforms itself and continues to exude its aura of madness. The players must find a way to destroy it permanently. |

## Lycan Uprising <br> (Player Level: 12-14)
In this encounter, the players follow the trail of a rampaging werewolf to the wreckage of a village it recently demolished. Shortly after the players’ arrival, the mangled remains of the village’s former inhabitants violently begin transforming into werewolves. 

### Encounter Context
This encounter begins with the assumption that the players are on the trail of a monstrous werewolf. They have heard tales of a werewolf savaging the countryside or been assigned the task of hunting down the renegade werewolf directly. Under these circumstances, the players should have had an opportunity to arm themselves properly for their hunt before this encounter.

If you wish to truly put your players on the back foot, you can instead have them stumble upon the town with no fore warning of what has happened or what they’re about to face. This will increase the odds of them needing to retreat if they have no means of slaying the werewolves.

### Lead Up

The werewolf’s trail leads the players to the burning wreckage of a small hamlet it has recently decimated. It is after dark in the dead of winter, and the only illumination is provided by the burning wreckage, which illuminates mangled and motionless bodies strewn across the ground.

The werewolf markers on the encounter map indicate which bodies aren’t truly dead but instead infected with lycanthropy. If the players attempt to inspect such a body before entering the town square, it will spring to life with a snarl and flee toward the center of town as it transforms into its hybrid form.

Once the players enter the town center or engage in combat with a werewolf they’ve managed to keep from fleeing, all of the werewolves will begin awakening.


When this occurs, you can read the following description:

<bR>

> ##### Encounter Start Description
> A howl pierces through the night, quickly followed by a chorus of tortured growling and snarling. You see several of the villagers’ bodies violently spasming as their lycanthropy overcomes them. The werewolves spring to action and waste no time in charging after you as the commanding howls of their new leader continue to echo through the village.

* **Lighting.** The full moon casts the village in dim light. The house interiors without fires are obscured in darkness.
* **The Ground.** The ground outside is open terrain. The snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement, and there are no significant slopes
* **Buildings.** The buildings are made from light wood walls and thatch roofs. A creature can smash a Small hole through a wall with a DC 10 Strength check and a Medium hole with a DC 15 Strength check. Werewolves can automatically smash Medium holes through walls as an action. The rubble within the buildings is considered rough terrain, and any creature that moves within the fires for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there will automatically take 1d4 fire damage.
* **Trees.** The trees around the town have relatively thick bases and provide three-quarters cover to any creatures behind them. They can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Fountain.** The fountain in the center of town stands 15 feet high and can provide total cover to creatures that are Medium or smaller.

### Encounter Tactics

This fight combines the reckless brutality of freshly formed werewolves with the tactical guidance of an experienced pack hunter.

#### The New Werewolves

The werewolves that come to life possess a near-mindless bloodlust but still follow the orders of their pack leader. They will immediately try to surround the most vulnerable-looking party member to utilize trip attacks and pack tactics. Because they must use half their movement standing up, werewolves from the further edges of town likely won’t reach players within the first round. This will give the players a chance to position themselves to avoid being surrounded.

#### The Pack Leader

The pack leader is more cunning and levelheaded than the freshly transformed werewolves. Its goal is to leverage the element of surprise so it can slaughter the players in an ambush and thus be rid of its pursuers. If this new pack of werewolves survives, so much the better. But, the pack leader has little attachment to them beyond their immediate usefulness.

The pack leader will burst through the window of its hiding spot and join the fray as soon as it detects that its pack is closing in on the players. It will utilize its Dog Pile ability to help its pack neutralize any dangerous spell casters as quickly as possible. If the players have positioned themselves in a way to gain the upper hand, the pack leader can use its Hunter’s Howl to scramble their positions while allowing its pack to catch up to preferred targets.

#### Retreat
The pack leader's goal is to eliminate the players and hopefully come away with a new pack to lead. If players reduce the pack leader to 50% health or less and are preventing it from regenerating reliably, it will prioritize escape. It will also attempt escape if more than half its pack is killed and the players are all in good shape. 

When attempting retreat, pack leader will take down a weakened player if given the opportunity, but not if it risks its life. It will also command other werewolves not engaged with a player to flee with it. Werewolves actively preoccupying players may be left behind to help buy the pack leader time.

The new werewolves are too consumed by their bloodthirst to care about self-perseveration. They will fight to the death unless commanded otherwise. They may also flee if they are outnumbered and have been reduced to 0 hit points one or more times.


### Aftermath
If all the werewolves are slain, the threat will be put down for good. But, if any new werewolves escape, there is the threat that other villages will come under attack as the lycanthropy spreads. If the pack leader is among those that escape, it will continue its rampage across the countryside with the aid of its new werewolves. If the players were forced to flee, the pack leader may even turn the tables and begin hunting them, swelling its ranks with new werewolves along the way.

If the players have the opportunity to search and investigate the village, they will find no survivors among the ruins. A chest in the town square belonged to a wealthy merchant who was killed while passing through town. Its locks were broken during the attack, and it contains 150 gp worth of gold bars. If the pack leader is slain, the players will be able to loot a pair of gem-studded bracers it was wearing, each worth 750 gp.



#### XP Award: 8,800xp
The degree of success they had in defeating the pack leader can affect the XP players receive. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The pack leader and all werewolves are slain, ending lycanthropic threat for good
* **100% XP:** The pack leader is slain, but several werewolves manage to escape, risking the further spread of lycanthropy across the land
* **50% XP:** The players drive off the werewolves, but the pack leader escapes
* **10% XP:** The players are forced to retreat



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficult accordingly.

**Easier Encounter (Level 9-11).** Stagger the pace at which the villagers are revived as werewolves, so only 2 attack at first along with the pack leader. Have a new werewolf revive and enter the battle at the beginning of each subsequent round. Change the XP Award to 4,800.

**Harder Encounter (Level 15-17).** Have a new werewolf revive in a random location at the beginning of each round for the next 5 rounds after the encounter starts. Change the XP Award to 10,000.

|  1  | The pack leader serves a more powerful master who tasked it with raising a werewolf army for future conquest. |
|  2  | The pack leader is acting in service of a vindictive nature spirit who wishes to drive all forms of civilization from its wilderness home, even if that means transforming all the humanoid inhabitants into vicious lycanthropes. |
|  3  | The pack leader fled from a group of vampire nobles who use werewolves as slave warriors. Its goal was to raise a rebel army of lycanthropes to overthrow its former masters. |
|  4  | The pack leader has a dark form of lycanthropy, keeping it trapped in its hybrid form at all times. Those it infects are inflicted with the same curse and stuck as bloodthirsty savages at all times. If this curse isn’t stamped out, the entire countryside could soon be overrun with hordes of marauding werewolves.|

## Lunatic Moon <br> (Player Level: 9-11)
In this encounter, the players come across of group of unhinged moon worshippers performing a lunar ritual to transform themselves into werewolves, with the group’s leader becoming a werewolf moon mystic.

### Encounter Context
This encounter begins with the players coming across the lunatic cultists performing a primeval ritual underneath the full moon. The cultists are from a nearby town that has been suffering from waves of madness sweeping across its population in tandem with the lunar cycles. The town’s priest, who in his madness has forsaken his former god, now leads a small cult of deranged moon worshippers seeking to escape their weak human bodies. 

The players may have visited the town before the encounter and learned about a strange group of unhinged individuals who regularly sneak into the woods. One of the remaining sane townsfolk may have even asked the players for help in finding a way to end the madness.

### Lead Up

The town priest is performing a lunar ritual in the woods surrounded by his most fearsome devotees (**thugs**) who are on lookout and guard duty. Regardless of whether the players are spotted when they approach, the ritual begins taking effect by the time they arrive, transforming the priest into a moon mystic. If the players are hidden but wait longer than a minute to make their move, they will witness the other cultists begin turning into werewolves one by one. 

If the players are spotted or begin to attack, you can read the following description:

> The former priest lets loose an unholy howl that threatens to overwhelm your sanity. His cultists respond with a wolf-like battle cry as they move to attack. You notice an unnatural gleam in their eyes as their once-human features begin to twist into a wolfish visage.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The full moon illuminates the forest in dim light.
* **The Ground.** The ground between the trees and bushes is mostly clear terrain. The snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement, and there are no significant slopes
* **Trees and Bushes.** The bushes are very dense, and moving 5 feet through them costs 15 feet of movement. The lone trees provide three-quarters cover, and the tree clusters provide full cover. 
* **Ritual Altar.** A large wooden stump serves as the altar for the lupine ritual. Now that the ritual has been completed, the green crystal ball and other occult objects atop it no longer serve any active purpose.

* **T:** Cult Member (**thug**)




### Encounter Tactics

At the end of each round of combat, the moon mystic will choose a cultist to have transformed into a pack werewolf. This transformation causes it to regain all its health and be cured of any ailments it is suffering from that it could normally make a saving throw against at the start or end of its turn. If the moon mystic is slain, the ritual ends, and there are no further transformations.

#### The Moon Mystic

The moon mystic will begin the fight by using its Searing Moonlight to begin whittling down the players that appear to be the highest threat. These targets will likely be players able to do high damage from a distance. He then focuses on utilizing his lunar bolts to either neutralize more fragile players who rely on ranged attacks or to give his minions advantage on attacks against players they are focusing on. While the moon mystic still has lunar bolts available, he will keep his minions between himself and melee-focused players and utilize the trees as cover from ranged attacks. He will only pursue melee combat once he no longer has ranged attacks available.

#### Cultist Thugs/Werewolves

The thugs will open combat with heavy crossbow fire if they have a clear shot and the players are still at a distance. They will continue with this strategy until the players demonstrate clear ranged superiority, the players close the gap, or the majority of them have turned into werewolves.

When the werewolves or the thugs engage in melee combat, they will move in groups of at least two to utilize their Pack Tactics and try to gang up on single targets as much as possible. Thugs who are low health or at risk of getting hit by the moon mystic’s Searing Moonlight will be priority choices for werewolf transformation at the end of each round. 

The thugs and werewolves will also do what they can to stop players who are posing the highest direct threat to the moon mystic. That may mean focusing their damage on a soft target to bring them down quickly or using trip attacks on a melee-focused player to make it difficult for them to reach the mystic.

### Aftermath
If the moon mystic survives, he will continue his quest to convert the mad town to lycanthropy. If he is stopped, whether the madness afflicting the town ends or not depends on what you want the scope of this plot to be. If you wish this to be a one-off encounter, the mad priest may have been the source of the madness all along, having turned to the worship of an insane lunar deity who brought about this insanity. Otherwise, the priest may have been a symptom of the madness rather than the cause. In this case, the players will need to investigate further to get to the bottom of the town’s lunar curse.

The crystal ball on the altar was used as a focus for the ritual but is no longer tied to the curse, and it is essentially an art object worth 500 gp at this point.

\columnbreak

#### XP Award:4,800xp
The degree of success they had in defeating the cultists can affect the XP the players receive. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **100% XP:** The moon mystic and all the cultists were neutralized
* **50% XP:** The cultists were neutralized, but the moon mystic escaped
* **10% XP:** The players retreated with the moon mystic and the majority of the cultists still alive 

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficult accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Reduce the number of thugs to 3. Change the XP Award to 3,600.

**Harder Encounter.** Have the thugs transform into pack werewolves two at a time. Change the XP Award to 8,000.   

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The priest began worshipping a lunar god of madness along with the rest of his clergy. They have been spreading their insane beliefs among the town in hopes of attracting the god’s blessing. |
|  2  | The priest’s ritual has resulted in permanent nightfall over the village with the full moon overhead. The players must find the components for a corresponding sun ritual to restore the day and cure the town of its insanity. |
|  3  | Though the curse appears to have been lifted from the town, the players become plagued by demented nightmares. Each time they have these nightmares, people nearby seem to be mentally affected by them. |
|  4  | The disruption to the ritual has driven the majority of the village into a murderous frenzy. The remaining sane inhabitants beg the players to help them escape as the other inhabitants devolve into twisted monsters. |

### Lootable Wolf Items
The following table lists the types of materials likely to be harvested from wolves and the suggested skills your players can use to attempt their harvest.

<br>The number of items harvested and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their harvesting check.

### Wolf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to harvest depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're harvesting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

While illuminated this way, the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack roll against an affected target has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected target can't benefit from being invisible.
>
> ***Searing Moonlight. (1/Day)*** A pale beam of moonlight appears and fills a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 120 of the werewolf. The cylinder lasts as long as the werewolf maintains concentration on it, up to a minute (as if concentrating on a spell). The area of the cylinder is considered dimly lit. Any non-shapechanger that is caught in the area of the moonbeam when it first appears or that ends its turn within the moonbeam must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. It takes 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While maintaining concentration on this ability, the werewolf can use its bonus action to move the beam 30 feet in any direction.

> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Shapechanger.*** The werewolf polymorphs into wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
