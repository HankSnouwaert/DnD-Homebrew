## The Gingerbread Bakery <br> (Player Level: 6-8)
In this encounter, the players break into a bakery and battle rogue gingerbread men who are in the process of assembling a legion of giant gingerbread golems.

### Encounter Context
This encounter can work as a standalone side quest or the inciting incident for a larger adventure. All that is required is that the players know there are destructive gingerbread creatures that have taken over a bakery and that they must be destroyed before they can make an army of their kind to wreak havoc.

### Lead Up
There will be little to stop the players from bursting into the bakery. Once the ginger runners detect the players, they will begin rushing to finish the 3 nearly completed ginger golems.

### Map Description
* **The Bakery.** The floor and walls of the bakery are made of stone, with the walls being 15 feet high and not climbable by creatures without a climb speed.
* **Carts.** The carts contain baking supplies and can be used as cover by creatures that are Small or smaller or Medium creatures that are prone.
* **Furniture.** There are several large objects and pieces of furniture throughout the bakery that can be treated as difficult terrain.


### Running the Encounter
The ginger golems are prone and paralyzed on each of their tables. Each ginger golem remains this way until five actions have been used to finish its decorations and awaken it. The ginger runners may use the extra action granted by the quickened condition (described later in the document) to decorate a ginger golem. Due to their low intelligence, the ginger runners will not always coordinate their efforts optimally; instead, they focus on finishing whichever ginger golem is closest.

#### Ginger Runner Tactics
The ginger runners will prioritize completing the ginger golems over fighting the players. If there are no more golems to awaken, they will focus on providing support to the golems. They use the Help action to assist the golems while using their bonus action and extra action (gained from being quickened) to stay out of the players' reach.

#### Ginger Golem Tactics
Ginger golems are simple-minded creatures with straightforward tactics. One thing to remember is that if a ginger golem loses its head, it retains blindsight up to a range of 30 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight.

* **R:** Ginger Runner Starting Location (Ignore Red Rs unless you're running the harder difficulty, and ignore the orange Rs if you're running the easier difficulty)

### Aftermath
The ginger golems are singleminded in their mission and will fight to the end. The ginger golems will stay so long as any ginger golems still need to be completed or are still fighting. Once all the ginger golems are destroyed, the ginger runners will flee. 

If the players flee, the gingerbread creatures won't chase them unless all the ginger golems present have been completed. 

#### Loot
The players can loot the individual ginger creatures they slay for magical *snacks of swiftness* (described later in this document) which will remain fresh and functional for a limited amount of time.

Ginger runners naturally drop a *snack of swiftness* as part of their **Quick Snack** ability. You can let players try to harvest more *snacks of swiftness* from the remains of larger gingerbread monsters as well.

##### Looting Ginger Golems
A player that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Cook's Utensils) check, can harvest 2d4 (5) *snacks of swiftness* that each expire after 8 hours. If the check fails by 5 or less (DC 10), 1d4(2) are found instead. If the check succeeds by 5 or more (DC 20), 3d4 (7) are found instead.

##### Additional Loot
If you wish to provide additional treasure, you can let the players find 1d4 rare consumable magic items. These could be *snacks of swiftness* or potions made from leftover magical ingredients in the bakery.


#### XP Award: 5,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the gingerbread creatures can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeated all the gingerbread creatures without taking much damage or allowing any to escape, and no more than two ginger golems were awakened.
* **100% XP:** The players defeated all the gingerbread creatures, but they lost significant resources, some of the ginger runners escaped, or more than two of the ginger golems were awakened.
* **50% XP:** The players flee after destroying more than half of the ginger golems and half of the ginger runners.
* **10% XP:** The players flee with more than half the ginger golems or ginger runners remaining.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty by using different beastmen mob tables and changing the XP award accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Levels 3-5).** Remove the ginger runners marked in orange on the encounter map.

Change the XP award to 2,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Levels 8-10).** Add the ginger runners marked in red on the encounter map.

Change the XP award to 7,000 XP.

### Adventure Lead Ups (TODO)
If you wish to make this the final encounter of a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Tainted Forest:** The once-sacred woods have been corrupted, with creatures going mad and the very trees oozing dark energy. As the players investigate, they learn that the Crone Grandmother is channeling dark spirits to amplify her own power. Stopping her becomes the key to saving the forest. |
|  2  | **The Missing Children:** Children from nearby villages have started disappearing. Whispered tales speak of the Crone Grandmother seeking to rejuvenate her life force through youth sacrifice. The heroes must navigate her twisted woods, face her challenges, and ultimately confront her to save the innocent.|

|  3  | **Revenge of the Coven:** After upsetting or defeating a local crone, the party attracts the attention of the Crone Grandmother, the leader of all woodland crones. The party must defend themselves against her wrath, which culminates in a climactic battle in her forest lair.|
|  4  |**Nature’s Balance:** A circle of druids pleads with the heroes for help. The Crone Grandmother has disrupted the balance of nature. While she was once a protector of the wilds, her recent actions threaten to plunge the world into chaos. The party must uncover the reason behind her change and stop her. |
