## The Gingerbread Bakery <br> (Player Level: 6-8)
In this encounter, the players break into a bakery and battle rogue gingerbread men who are in the process of assembling a legion of giant gingerbread golems.

### Encounter Context
This encounter can work as a standalone side quest or the inciting incident for a larger adventure. All that is required is that the players know there are destructive gingerbread creatures that have taken over a bakery and that they must be destroyed before they can make an army of their kind to wreak havoc.

### Lead Up
There will be little to stop the players from bursting into the bakery. Once the ginger runners detect the players, they will begin rushing to finish the 5 nearly completed ginger golems.

### Map Description
* **The Bakery.** The floor and walls of the bakery are made of stone, with the walls being 15 feet high and not climbable by creatures without a climb speed.
* **Carts.** The carts contain baking supplies and can be used as cover by creatures that are Small or smaller or Medium creatures that are prone.
* **Furniture.** There are several large objects and pieces of furniture throughout the bakery that can be treated as difficult terrain.


### Running the Encounter
The ginger golems are prone and paralyzed on each of their tables. Each ginger golem remains this way until five actions have been used to finish its decorations and awaken it. The ginger runners may use the extra action granted by the quickened condition (described later in the document) to decorate a ginger golem. Due to their low intelligence, the ginger runners will not always coordinate their efforts optimally; instead, they focus on finishing whichever ginger golem is closest.

#### Ginger Runner Tactics
The ginger runners will prioritize completing the ginger golems over fighting the players. If there are no more golems to awaken, they will focus on providing support to the golems. They use the Help action to assist the golems while using their bonus action and extra action (gained from being quickened) to stay out of the players' reach.

#### Ginger Golem Tactics
Ginger golems are simple-minded creatures with straightforward tactics. One thing to remember is that if a ginger golem loses its head, it retains blindsight up to a range of 30 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight.

* <font color="918007">**Yellow Areas:**</font> Furniture (Rough Terrain)

* **G:** Ginger Golem Starting Location
* **R:** Ginger Runner Starting Location (Ignore Red Rs unless you're running the harder difficulty, and ignore the orange Rs if you're running the easier difficulty)

<br>

### Aftermath
The ginger golems are singleminded in their mission and will fight to the end. The ginger golems will stay so long as any ginger golems still need to be completed or are still fighting. Once all the ginger golems are destroyed, the ginger runners will flee. 

If the players flee, the gingerbread creatures won't chase them unless all the ginger golems present have been completed. 

#### Loot
The players can loot the individual ginger creatures they slay for magical *snacks of swiftness* (described later in this document) which will remain fresh and functional for a limited amount of time.

Ginger runners naturally drop a *snack of swiftness* as part of their **Quick Snack** ability. You can let players try to harvest more *snacks of swiftness* from the remains of larger gingerbread monsters as well.

\pagebreakNum


##### Looting Ginger Golems
A player that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Cook's Utensils) check, can harvest 2d4 (5) *snacks of swiftness* that each expire after 8 hours. If the check fails by 5 or less (DC 10), 1d4(2) are found instead. If the check succeeds by 5 or more (DC 20), 3d4 (7) are found instead.

##### Additional Loot
If you wish to provide additional treasure, you can let the players find 1d4 rare consumable magic items. These could be *snacks of swiftness* or potions made from leftover magical ingredients in the bakery.


#### XP Award: 5,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the gingerbread creatures can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The players defeated all the gingerbread creatures without taking much damage or allowing any to escape, and no more than two ginger golems were awakened.
* **100% XP:** The players defeated all the gingerbread creatures, but they lost significant resources, some of the ginger runners escaped, or more than two of the ginger golems were awakened.
* **50% XP:** The players flee after destroying more than half of the ginger golems and half of the ginger runners.
* **10% XP:** The players flee with more than half the ginger golems or ginger runners remaining.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty by using different beastmen mob tables and changing the XP award accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Levels 3-5).** Remove the ginger runners marked in orange on the encounter map.

Change the XP award to 2,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Levels 8-10).** Add the ginger runners marked in red on the encounter map.

Change the XP award to 7,000 XP.

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
>  * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
>  * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.




\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.



> ##### New Item: Snack of Swiftness
> *Wondrous item, rare (200g)*<Br>
> When you eat this treat, you are quickened for 1 minute.



### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Confectionery Coup:** The players discover that the bakery is the center of a plot to overthrow the local government or a powerful guild. The rogue ginger runners, under the command of a disgruntled baker turned sorcerer, are creating ginger golems as an army to stage a coup.

|  2  | **The Secret of the Gingerbread Formula:** The bakery holds the secret to an ancient, powerful recipe that can create sentient gingerbread creatures. A nefarious group seeks this formula to build an unstoppable gingerbread army. The players must secure the formula and decide what to do with such dangerous knowledge.|
|  3  | **The Cursed Bakery:** The bakery is cursed, causing all its products to come to life with hostile intentions. The players must investigate the source of the curse, battling the ginger runners and golems while seeking a way to lift the curse before it spreads beyond the bakery.|
|  4  |**The Gingerbread Mafia:** The bakery is a front for an illegal operation that sells enchanted gingerbread creatures on the black market. The players must infiltrate the operation, gather evidence, and dismantle the network, facing various criminal elements interested in using ginger golems for their purposes. |

> ***Crumble.*** Whenever the ginger golem takes at least 10 bludgeoning or thunder damage from a single source, or at least 20 damage of any time from a single source, roll a d10 to determine if and how it begins to crumble. If it has 60 hit points or less, roll 2d10 and apply the effects for each dice:
> * 1-2: Nothing happens. 
> * 3-4: One leg breaks off the ginger golem if it has any legs left. 
> * 5-6: One arm breaks off the ginger golem if it has any arms left. 
> * 7-8: Its gumdrop button falls off if it still has it. 
> * 9-10: The ginger golem is decapitated if it still has a head. The ginger golem does not die from this.
>
> A broken part lands in a random spot within 5 feet of the ginger golem, becoming a small object. If its head is severed, the ginger golem is blinded. Its speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone and can't stand up. With both arms, it can make a fist attack. With only one arm, it can still make a fist attack, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed. The ginger golem dies if all of its parts are broken off.
>
> ***Gumdrop Button.*** The ginger golem has a gumdrop button, which falls off if it takes 5 or more fire damage or lightning damage from a single source. If the gumdrop button falls off, the ginger golem goes berserk for the next 10 minutes. While berserk, it is quickened and has advantage on all melee weapon attacks.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The ginger golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Naive.*** The ginger golem has disadvantage on saving throws against being charmed and on Wisdom (Insight) checks.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The ginger golem makes a Slam attack, and a Fist attack for each arm it has.
>
> ***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
