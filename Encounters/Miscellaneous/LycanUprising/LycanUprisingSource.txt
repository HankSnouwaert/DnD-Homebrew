## Lycan Uprising <br> (Player Level: 12-14)
In this encounter, the players follow the trail of a rampaging werewolf to the wreckage of a village it recently demolished. Shortly after the players’ arrival, the mangled remains of the village’s former inhabitants violently begin transforming into werewolves. 

### Encounter Context
This encounter begins with the assumption that the players are on the trail of a monstrous werewolf. They have heard tales of a werewolf savaging the countryside or been assigned the task of hunting down the renegade werewolf directly. Under these circumstances, the players should have had an opportunity to arm themselves properly for their hunt before this encounter.

If you wish to truly put your players on the back foot, you can instead have them stumble upon the town with no fore warning of what has happened or what they’re about to face. This will increase the odds of them needing to retreat if they have no means of slaying the werewolves.

### Lead Up

The werewolf’s trail leads the players to the burning wreckage of a small hamlet it has recently decimated. It is after dark in the dead of winter, and the only illumination is provided by the burning wreckage, which illuminates mangled and motionless bodies strewn across the ground.

The werewolf markers on the encounter map indicate which bodies aren’t truly dead but instead infected with lycanthropy. If the players attempt to inspect such a body before entering the town square, it will spring to life with a snarl and flee toward the center of town as it transforms into its hybrid form.

Once the players enter the town center or engage in combat with a werewolf they’ve managed to keep from fleeing, all of the werewolves will begin awakening.


When this occurs, you can read the following description:

<bR>

> ##### Encounter Start Description
> A howl pierces through the night, quickly followed by a chorus of tortured growling and snarling. You see several of the villagers’ bodies violently spasming as their lycanthropy overcomes them. The werewolves spring to action and waste no time in charging after you as the commanding howls of their new leader continue to echo through the village.

##### Map Legend
* **P:** Player Arrival Location
* **W:** Villager Body Ready to Turn into a Werewolf Packmate
* **L:** Werewolf Pack Leader

<br> 

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The full moon casts the village in dim light. The house interiors without fires are obscured in darkness.
* **The Ground.** The ground outside is open terrain. The snowy areas are not deep enough to impede movement, and there are no significant slopes
* **Buildings.** The buildings are made from light wood walls and thatch roofs. A creature can smash a Small hole through a wall with a DC 10 Strength check and a Medium hole with a DC 15 Strength check. Werewolves can automatically smash Medium holes through walls as an action. The rubble within the buildings is considered rough terrain, and any creature that moves within the fires for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there will automatically take 1d4 fire damage.
* **Trees.** The trees around the town have relatively thick bases and provide three-quarters cover to any creatures behind them. They can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Fountain.** The fountain in the center of town stands 15 feet high and can provide total cover to creatures that are Medium or smaller.

### Encounter Tactics

This fight combines the reckless brutality of freshly formed werewolves with the tactical guidance of an experienced pack hunter.

#### The New Werewolves

The werewolves that come to life possess a near-mindless bloodlust but still follow the orders of their pack leader. They will immediately try to surround the most vulnerable-looking party member to utilize trip attacks and pack tactics. Because they must use half their movement standing up, werewolves from the further edges of town likely won’t reach players within the first round. This will give the players a chance to position themselves to avoid being surrounded.

#### The Pack Leader

The pack leader is more cunning and levelheaded than the freshly transformed werewolves. Its goal is to leverage the element of surprise so it can slaughter the players in an ambush and thus be rid of its pursuers. If this new pack of werewolves survives, so much the better. But, the pack leader has little attachment to them beyond their immediate usefulness.

The pack leader will burst through the window of its hiding spot and join the fray as soon as it detects that its pack is closing in on the players. It will utilize its Dog Pile ability to help its pack neutralize any dangerous spell casters as quickly as possible. If the players have positioned themselves in a way to gain the upper hand, the pack leader can use its Hunter’s Howl to scramble their positions while allowing its pack to catch up to preferred targets.

#### Retreat
The pack leader's goal is to eliminate the players and hopefully come away with a new pack to lead. If players reduce the pack leader to 50% health or less and are preventing it from regenerating reliably, it will prioritize escape. It will also attempt escape if more than half its pack is killed and the players are all in good shape. 

When attempting retreat, pack leader will take down a weakened player if given the opportunity, but not if it risks its life. It will also command other werewolves not engaged with a player to flee with it. Werewolves actively preoccupying players may be left behind to help buy the pack leader time.

The new werewolves are too consumed by their bloodthirst to care about self-perseveration. They will fight to the death unless commanded otherwise. They may also flee if they are outnumbered and have been reduced to 0 hit points one or more times.


### Aftermath
If all the werewolves are slain, the threat will be put down for good. But, if any new werewolves escape, there is the threat that other villages will come under attack as the lycanthropy spreads. If the pack leader is among those that escape, it will continue its rampage across the countryside with the aid of its new werewolves. If the players were forced to flee, the pack leader may even turn the tables and begin hunting them, swelling its ranks with new werewolves along the way.

If the players have the opportunity to search and investigate the village, they will find no survivors among the ruins. A chest in the town square belonged to a wealthy merchant who was killed while passing through town. Its locks were broken during the attack, and it contains 150 gp worth of gold bars. If the pack leader is slain, the players will be able to loot a pair of gem-studded bracers it was wearing, each worth 750 gp.



#### XP Award: 8,800xp
The degree of success they had in defeating the pack leader can affect the XP players receive. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The pack leader and all werewolves are slain, ending lycanthropic threat for good
* **100% XP:** The pack leader is slain, but several werewolves manage to escape, risking the further spread of lycanthropy across the land
* **50% XP:** The players drive off the werewolves, but the pack leader escapes
* **10% XP:** The players are forced to retreat



### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficult accordingly.

**Easier Encounter (Level 9-11).** Stagger the pace at which the villagers are revived as werewolves, so only 2 attack at first along with the pack leader. Have a new werewolf revive and enter the battle at the beginning of each subsequent round. Change the XP Award to 4,800.

**Harder Encounter (Level 15-17).** Have a new werewolf revive in a random location at the beginning of each round for the next 5 rounds after the encounter starts. Change the XP Award to 10,000.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The pack leader serves a more powerful master who tasked it with raising a werewolf army for future conquest. |
|  2  | The pack leader is acting in service of a vindictive nature spirit who wishes to drive all forms of civilization from its wilderness home, even if that means transforming all the humanoid inhabitants into vicious lycanthropes. |
|  3  | The pack leader fled from a group of vampire nobles who use werewolves as slave warriors. Its goal was to raise a rebel army of lycanthropes to overthrow its former masters. |
|  4  | The pack leader has a dark form of lycanthropy, keeping it trapped in its hybrid form at all times. Those it infects are inflicted with the same curse and stuck as bloodthirsty savages at all times. If this curse isn’t stamped out, the entire countryside could soon be overrun with hordes of marauding werewolves.|

Each other creature within 120 feet of the werewolf must then succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the werewolf. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
