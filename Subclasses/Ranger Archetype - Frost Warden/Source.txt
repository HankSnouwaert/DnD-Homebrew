## Ranger Archetype

### Frost Warden
Although many rangers are accustomed to roaming wintery wilds and arctic landscapes, frost wardens truly master the extreme elements of these environments.  These rangers can forge weapons of true ice capable of chilling enemies to the bone, slowing and even binding them in freezing ice.  

While frost wardens can all be recognized by their use of true ice weapons and arctic magic, these rangers' combat styles greatly vary.  Some are frost archers, harrying foes with icy arrows while always staying out of reach.  Other frost wardens learn to forge true ice armor, allowing them to wade into battle and chill any enemy that strikes at them.  Still, other frost wardens choose to hone their magical abilities, combining their natural heartiness with a deadly arsenal of arctic magic.  


#### Frost Warden Magic
*3rd-level Frost Warden Feature*<br>
You learn one or more additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Frost Warden Spells table.  These spells count as a ranger spell for you, but they don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

Additionally, your ranger spells that deal cold damage ignore resistance to cold damage and treat immunity to cold damage as resistance.

##### Frost Warden Spells
| Ranger  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  3rd          | *armor of agathys*  |
|  5th          | *snowball storm*  |
|  9th          | *frost nova*  | 
|  13th         | *ice storm*     |
|  17th         |  *cone of cold*    |

#### Wisdom of the North
*3rd-level Frost Warden Feature*<br>
You can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without any additional protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees Fahrenheit. You also ignore difficult terrain created by ice or snow.

Additionally, whenever you make a skill check to interact with an arctic environment or a creature who lives in such an environment, if you have proficiency in that skill, you apply double your proficiency bonus to the check.

Finally, if you would apply your Dexterity modifier to your AC, you may apply your Wisdom modifier instead.

#### True Ice Weapons
*3rd-level Frost Warden Feature*<br>
Over the course of a short or long rest, you can infuse a weapon with the biting cold of the north.  You can have up to two weapons infused this way at a time, and only you can benefit from these infusions.

Once per turn, you can unleash the power of one of these weapons against a creature you have hit with it.  That creature takes an additional 1d4 cold damage and has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of your next turn.

This cold damage ignores resistances and treats immunity as resistance.

At 11th level, you may use this ability twice per turn.

#### Boreal Specialization 
*7th-level Frost Warden Feature*<br>
You gain one of the following features of your choice, representing how you've chosen to hone your arctic magic.<br>

***Arctic Magic.*** You've enhanced your mastery of icy magics.  The following spells are added to your Frost Warden spell list:

##### Expanded Frost Warden Spells
| Ranger  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  3rd          | *ice knife*  |
|  5th          | *rime's binding ice*  |
|  9th          | *sleet storm*  | 
|  13th         |  *fire shield*    |
|  17th         |     TBD |

Additionally, you can cast a number of spells from your Ice Warden spell list whose combined spell level is less than or equal to your proficiency modifier without expending any spell slots.  You regain full use of this ability when you complete a long rest.

***Icy Death.***
When you hit a creature with a true ice weapon, you can choose to cause a wave of ice to explode outwards from your weapon, dealing 1d6 cold damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the target.

***True Ice Armor.*** You've learned how to infuse armor with the same icy magic you use to infuse your weapons.  Over the course of a short or long rest, you can infuse a set of armor with the biting cold of the north.   You can have up to one set of armor infused this way at a time, and only you can benefit from the armor's infusion.  When you infuse the armor, you can change its AC to 18.

 When a creature hits you with a melee attack while you're wearing this armor, you can deal cold damage to it as though you struck it with a true ice weapon.  Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.

#### Binding Ice
*11th-level Frost Warden Feature*<br>
Whenever you deal additional damage to a creature due to the *hunter's mark* spell or your Favored Enemy feature, you can change this damage to cold damage.  If you do so, you can also reduce the target's speed by 10 feet.

Additionally, when you deal cold damage to a target that has had its movement reduced by one of your ranger spells or abilities, you can force that creature to make a Constitution save against your spell save DC.  If it fails, it is encased in ice and restrained until the start of your next turn.  You can attempt to restrain a creature this way a number of times equal to your Proficiency Bonus and regain all uses of this ability when you complete a long rest.

#### Enhanced Specialization
*15th-level Frost Warden Feature*<br>
You can choose a second option from your Boreal Specialization feature.  Alternatively, you can choose to expand upon the option you already picked, gaining the following additional benefits:

***Arctic Magic (Enhanced).***
Choose one of the following spells: *frozen sphere*, *investiture of ice*, or *wall of ice*.  You can cast the chosen spell once per day as though it is a spell from your Frost Warden spell list without needing to expend a spell slot.  You regain the ability to cast the spell after completing a long rest. 

***Icy Death (Enhanced)***
When you hit a creature restrained by your Binding Ice feature with a true ice weapon, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failure, the creature is petrified for one minute or until it takes 10 or more fire damage.  It can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.  
If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points while petrified this way, you can trigger the effects of an *ice nova* spell centered at its location.  This effect uses your spell save DC for its saving throws.

***True Ice Armor (Enhanced).***
You can increase your true ice armor's AC to 19, and it can deal cold damage up to twice per turn to creatures who strike you, rather than once.

Additionally, you can cast *spirit guardians* while wearing this armor as though it were a spell on your Frost Warden spell list.  Its damage type changes to cold, and taking damage does not force you to make checks to maintain concentration of the spell.
