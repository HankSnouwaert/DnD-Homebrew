## Otherworldly Patron

### The Influencer 
 Unlike other patrons, this entity is not defined by being a specific type of creature.  It could be a fiend, an arch fey, or even a collective of powerful and influential individuals.  This patron is defined by what it can offer: fame, prestige, and influence.  Warlocks with this patron may gain sudden celebrity or political status as part of their pact.  Their prestige and influence will also manifest itself in their powers.  These warlocks can command attention to themselves with their supernatural influence,  brutalize their foes through vicious wit and mockery, and through sheer confidence they can survive assaults that would lay low another warlock.
