## Roguish Archetype

### Spellthief
Spellthieves use skill and arcane magic to drain the abilities of their opponents and turn their foes' own powers against them. Spellthieves love the challenges that adventure brings, and they relish finding unique and inventive ways to use their abilities.  Spellthieves never cast two spells when one will do, and they excel at using misdirection and deception to overcome seemingly stronger opponents.

#### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

**Cantrips.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn another wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Spell Slots.** The Spellthief Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  For example, if you know the 1st level *Absorb Elements* and have a 1st-level and 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *Absorb Elements* using either slot.

**Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.** You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and divination spells on the wizard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Spellthief Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or divination spell of your choice and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or divination spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div align="center"> 

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

#### Spell Sight
As a Spellthief, you've become adapt at spotting sources of magic.  

At 3rd level you automatically learn *Detect Magic* and may cast it as a ritual. While concentrating on it, you may use a bonus action, rather than an action, to see magical auras in your vicinity.

#### Steal Spell
Beginning at 3rd level, when you make a successful melee sneak attack against a creature, you can either steal a cantrip or a spell of 1st level or higher by forgoing 1d6 of sneak attack damage per level of the spell being stolen.  You can also steal a spell from a willing target via touch as an action, but you cannot have a stolen spell of a higher level than your number of sneak attack die. 

You may describe to the DM what spell you are attempting to steal.  This description may include spell level, damage type, spell effect, or even a specific spell name.  If there are multiple spells that fit the description, the DM chooses from amongst them at random.  If there are no spells that fit the description, the DM chooses from all the options at random.

If a cantrip is stolen, the target loses the ability to cast this cantrip for 1 hour and you may replace a cantrip you know with the stolen cantrip.  If a spell of 1st level or higher is stolen, the target loses a spell slot of that level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

\pagebreak

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were a wizard spell you know at the level at which it was stolen. When casting the spell, you must supply the same components (including verbal, somatic, and material) required for the stolen spell.  You lose all stolen spells after completing a long rest. 

You can steal a number of spells per day with a total combined spell level equal to your rogue level.  You regain full usage of this feature after you complete a long rest.

#### Steal Magic Effect
Beginning at 9th level, you can steal an active spell from another creature. 

When you hit an opponent with a successful melee sneak attack, you can choose to forgo some of the sneak attack damage and instead steal an active spell effect from the target or a spell it is maintaining concentration on. You must make an Intelligence check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level.  On a successful check, you steal the effect.  The amount of sneak attack damage die foregone is equal to the spell level of the stolen effect.  If the spell level of the effect is greater than the number of sneak attack die you have available, you automatically fail to steal the effect.

The duration of the stolen effect carries over to you and cannot last longer than a number of minutes equal to your rogue level.  After this time, the effect automatically expires.  If you steal a spell effect that was being maintained through concentration, you must maintain concentration on the effect for this duration.

The spell level of the stolen effect counts against the total number of levels worth of spells that can be stolen per day.

#### Steal Energy Resistance
Beginning at 13th level, you can siphon a creature’s resistance to a particular non-physical damage type.  When you hit an opponent with a successful melee sneak attack, you can choose to forgo all sneak attack damage and leech resistance to any damage type other than slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning from a target.  

If the target has more than one resistance or immunity and you don’t specify which one you wish to steal, the DM chooses one at random.  You gain that resistance for one hour and if the target has that resistance, it loses it for one hour.  If target has immunity to the chosen damage type, it retains this immunity.

#### Specialized Spells
Also, at 13th level you automatically learn *Counterspell* and *Dispel Magic*.  These count as wizard spells for you, and don't count against your total number of spells known. 

If you successfully remove a spell effect with *Dispel Magic* that you could steal using your Steal Magic Effect feature, you may steal it as though you used that feature.  If you successfully negate a spell with *Counterspell* that you could steal using your Steal Spell feature, you may steal it as though you used your Steal Spell feature.

#### Spell Reflection
Beginning at 17th level, if you successfully steal a spell as a reaction using *Counterspell*, you may immediately cast that spell as part of the same reaction.
