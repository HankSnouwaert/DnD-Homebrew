## Divine Domain 

### Grave
Gods of destruction demand one thing of their followers: to bring about devastation wherever they tread. Gods of this domain include Shiva, Kali, Set, Tiamat, Gruumsh, The Devourer, and The Fury. Clerics of these gods are not only masters of destruction, but they also bring forth the full destructive potential of their allies. Woe be to any who stand in their path.

#### Domain Spells
*1st level Grave Domain feature*<br>
You gain the domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Destruction Domain Spells table.  See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

##### Destruction Domain Spells
| Cleric  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1st          |  *cursed blades**, *false life* |
|  3rd          | *gentle repose*, *ray of enfeeblement* |
|  5th          | *revivify*, *speak with dead*      | 
|  7th          | *death ward*, *decrepify**       |
|  9th          | *antilife shell*, *raise dead*    |



Additionally, you learn the *tomb strike* and *spare the dying* cantrips, which don't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, *spare the dying* has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

#### Kanopic Jar
*1st level grave domain feature*<br>
You start with a set of potter's tools, and you gain proficiency in potter's tools. If you already have proficiency in potter's tools, you gain proficiency in another set of tools of your choice. 

You also begin with a magical kanopic jar. It is a tiny, 5 lb. object capable of holding up to 10 pounds of material not exceeding a volume of 1 cubic foot. The jar can be use as a spell casting focus for your cleric spells and you can use any spell regents within it as though you're holding them. 

If the jar is lost or destroyed, you can use your potter's tools to spend 1 hour creating a new one, which can be done over the course of a short rest. Doing so requires you to sacrifice an offering of gems or other rare materials worth at least 10 times your cleric level to your god, destroying the materials in the process.

#### Beseech The Dead
*1st level Grave Domain feature*<br>
You've learned how to call back the soul of a willing creature into the service of your god.

**Contacting the Dead.** While within 5 feet of a Small or Medium creature's corpse, you can spend 1 minute communing with its spirit. The creature must have been a beast, fey, dragon, giant, humanoid, or monstrosity in life, its corpse must be mostly intact, and its spirit be willing and able to communicate. 

The spirit cannot provide you with any useful information about its life or the circumstances of its death. While communing with the creature, you can beseech its aid, requesting that the spirit temporarily return to the remains of its body to act in your service. Doing so typically requires a Wisdom ability check to attempt to successfully beseech the spirit. You can add your proficiency modifier to the result of this check. See the Beseeching The Dead note block for more guidence on how playing out this interaction.


**Awakening the Dead.** If the creature's spirit agrees to serve you, you can conduct a 1 hour ritual to return the spirit to its corpse and bind it to your service. This must be done within 24 hours of having contacted the spirit, and can be done over the course of a short rest. The ritual involves preparing the corpse through a mummification-like process that binds it to your kanopic jar. Once it awakens, it uses the game statistics in the mummified minion stat block which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

 Any attempts to awaken another mummy fail while this mummy is active.

**Commanding the Dead.**
In combat, the mummy shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.  It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action.
That action can be one in its stat block or some other action.  If you are incapacitated, the mummy can take any action of its choice, not just dodge.  

**Dissmissing and Resummoning the Dead.**
While the mummy is in your service, you can dismiss while it is within 5 feet of you as an action by opening your kanopic jar, causing it to be sucked within in a swirl of sand. You can later use an action to open the kanopic and conjure it back into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. 

The mummy takes up no space in your jar while it is dismissed. If the jar is destroyed while dismissed, it is immediately summoned back into the nearest unoccupied space available.

**Ending the Service of the Dead.**
The mummy's service lasts for the duration it agreed to when you contacted it, at which point it crumbles to dust as its spirit returns to the afterlife. Its service also ends if you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points. 


**Legion of the Dead.** 
Starting a 6th level, you can have 2 mummies in your service at a time. This number increases to 3 at 8th level and 4 at 17th level. You can dismiss and resummon multiple mummies at once using your kanopic jar.

> ##### Roleplaying Beseeching The Dead
> When the you contact the dead as part of your Channel Divinity feature, the DM determine's the DC of the check to beseech the contacted spirit based on how likely it is to agree to your request. The DM may even determine the check automatically fails or succeeds based on prior history you may have with the creature. The DM may also provide advantage or impose disadvantage on the check based on the circumstances or reasons you can provide the creature's spirit as to why it should volenteer its services.
> 
> Any of the following circumstances could give you advantage on the check:
> * The creature worshiped your patron god in life
> * Your mission aligns with something the creature cared about in life
> * You agree to do a favor on behalf of the creature, such as righting a wrong that occurred in its life, or exacting revenge on an enemy
> 
> The inverse of any of these circumstances could also impose disadvantage.
> 
> Creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or less are typically not capable of complex motivations and the likelyhood of beseeching them will depend more on how unruly they were in life.

#### Channel Divinity: Siphon Soul
*2nd level Grave Domain feature*<br>
You can snatch a trace of the life force from a passing soul and use it to heal your allies. When an enemy you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to channel vitality to you or one ally of your choice that is within 30 feet, granting it X hit points.

#### Support Undead Minion
*6th level Grave Domain feature*<br>
Whenever you target a mummy minion with a cleric spell of 5th level or lower or your Soul Siphon ability, you can target one additional creature within range of the spell or ability.


#### Potent Spellcasting
*8th level Grave Domain feature*<br>
You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.


#### Curse of the Grave
*17th level Grave Domain feature*<br>
As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it for one minute. While cursed this way, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. As an action, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC to attempt to be rid of the curse. On a successful save, the curse ends.

A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all your mummies for the next 24 hours.

*1st level Grave Domain feature*<br>
You've learned how to call back the soul of a willing creature into the service of your god.
