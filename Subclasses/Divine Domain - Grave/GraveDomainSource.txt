## Divine Domain 

### Grave
Gods of destruction demand one thing of their followers: to bring about devastation wherever they tread. Gods of this domain include Shiva, Kali, Set, Tiamat, Gruumsh, The Devourer, and The Fury. Clerics of these gods are not only masters of destruction, but they also bring forth the full destructive potential of their allies. Woe be to any who stand in their path.

#### Domain Spells
*1st level Grave Domain feature*<br>
You gain the domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Destruction Domain Spells table.  See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

##### Destruction Domain Spells
| Cleric  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1st          |  *cursed blades**, *false life* |
|  3rd          | *gentle repose*, *ray of enfeeblement* |
|  5th          | *revivify**, *speak with dead*      | 
|  7th          | *death ward*, *decrepify**       |
|  9th          | *antilife shell*, *raise dead*    |



Additionally, you learn the *tomb strike* and *spare the dying* cantrips, which don't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, *spare the dying* has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

#### Kanopic Jar
*1st level grave domain feature*<br>
You start with a set of potter's tools, and you gain proficiency in potter's tools. If you already have proficiency in potter's tools, you gain proficiency in another set of tools of your choice. 

You also begin with a magical kanopic jar. It is a tiny, 5 lb. object capable of holding up to 10 pounds of material not exceeding a volume of 1 cubic foot. The jar can be use as a spell casting focus for your cleric spells and you can use any spell regents within it as though you're holding them. 

If the jar is lost of destroyed, you can use your potter's tools to spend 1 hour creating a new one, which can be done over the course of a short rest. Doing so requires you to sacrifice an offering of gems or other rare materials worth at least 10 times your cleric level to your god, destroying the materials in the process.

#### Keeper of Souls
*1st level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 30 feet of you, you or one ally of your choice that is within 30 feet of you regains hit points equal to the enemy’s number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren't incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.

#### Channel Divinity: Beseech The Dead
*2nd level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
You've learned how to call back the soul of a willing creature into the service of your god.

**Contacting the Dead.** While within 5 feet of a Small or Medium creature's corpse, you can spend 1 minute communing with the creature's spirit. The creature must have been a beast, fey, dragon, giant, humanoid, or monstrosity in life and its corpse must be mostly intact. 

The spirit cannot provide you with any useful information about its life or the circumstances of its death. While communing with the creature, you can beseech its aid, requesting that the spirit temporarily return to the remains of its body to act in your service. Doing so typically requires a Wisdom ability check to attempt to successfully beseech the spirit. You can add your proficiency modifier to the result of this check. See the Beseeching The Dead note block on the next page for more guidence on how you can play out this interaction.

If a creature's spirit is trapped somewhere against its will, it cannot be contacted this way and all attempts to do so automatically fail.

**Awakening the Dead.** If the creature's spirit agrees to serve you, you can conduct a 1 hour ritual to return the spirit to its corpse and bind it to your service. This must be done within 24 hours of having contacted the spirit, and can be done over the course of a short rest. The ritual involves preparing the corpse through a mummification-like process that binds it to your kanopic jar. Once it awakens, it uses the game statistics in the mummified minion stat block which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

While the creature is awakened this way, it cannot be resurrected or raised as undead.

**Commanding the Dead.**
In combat, the mummy shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours.  It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action.
That action can be one in its stat block or some other action.  If you are incapacitated, the mummy can take any action of its choice, not just dodge.  

**Dissmissing and Resummoning the Dead.**
While the mummy is in your service, you can dismiss while it is within 5 feet of you it as an action by opening your kanopic jar, causing it to be sucked within in a swirl of sand. You can later use an action to open the kanopic and conjure it back into an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. 

The mummy takes up no space in your jar while it is dismissed. If the jar is destroyed while dismissed, it is immediately summoned back into the nearest unoccupied space available.

**Ending the Service of the Dead.**
The mummy's service lasts for the duration it agreed to when you contacted it, at which point it crumbles to dust as its spirit returns to the afterlife. Its service also ends if you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points. 

If you break any of the terms of the agreement it made when contacting it, it no longer serves you, and at the DM's discresion, may even become hostile towards you. At this point, the mummy is under the DM's control and may choose to abandon its body to return to the afterlife or remain in the mortal realm to achieve the ends it was promised. A mummy under the DM's control doesn't crumble to dust if you die.

**Legion of the Dead.** 
You can have a number of mummy minions at once equal to the number of times you can use your Channel Divinity per day. Any attempts to awaken another mummy fail unless you dismiss one of your existing mummies from your service. Mummies that are no longer in your service cannot be dismissed but still count towards the number of mummies you can have a once until they are destroyed.

You can dismiss and resummon multiple mummies at once using your kanopic jar.

> ##### Roleplaying Beseeching The Dead
> When the you contact the dead as part of your Channel Divinity feature, the DM determine's the DC of the check to beseech the contacted spirit based on how likely it is to agree to your request. The DM may even determine the check automatically fails or succeeds based on prior history you may have with the creature. The DM may also provide advantage or impose disadvantage on the check based on the circumstances or reasons you can provide the creature's spirit as to why it should volenteer its services.
> 
> Any of the following circumstances could give you advantage on the check:
> * The creature worshiped your patron god in life
> * Your mission aligns with something the creature cared about in life
> * You agree to do a favor on behalf of the creature, such as righting a wrong that occurred in its life, or exacting revenge on an enemy
> 
> The inverse of any of these circumstances could also impose disadvantage.
> 
> Creatures with an Intelligence of 3 or typically not capable of complex motivations and the likelyhood of beseeching them will depend more on how unruly they were in life.

> ***Mummy Rot.*** Once per turn, when the mummy strikes a creature with its Deathly Strike, it can force the creature to make a Consitution save against your spell save DC. On a failure, the creature is cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic

> 
> ***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 ft. of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.
