## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Underdark
DRUIDS!

#### Underdark Forms
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain access to the following wild shape forms at 2nd, 6th, 12th, 16th level.  The usual restrictions as to what you can wild shape into do not apply to these forms.  

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Grasslands Spells list.

| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option*      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Giant Lizard, Giant Badger  |
|  6th          | Giant Vampire Bat, Giant Wolf Spider      | 
|  12th          | Giant Venomous Mole, Giant Blind Salamander    |
|  16th          |  Giant Poisonous Spider, Megalania    |

#### Underdark Spells
Your mystical connection to the underdark infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.
