 You may use your action to name a condition or task no more than 25 words in length, and then touch a willing creature that can understand you. The creature must be able to understand the conditions and what happens if it doesn't obey them or else the contract fails.  

While under the contract, each time the creature willingly acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, it takes number of d8 psychic damage equal to your warlock level.  This can occur no more than once each day. 

The contract ends once the creature completes its task or if you use an action to dismiss it. A *Remove Curse*, *Greater Restoration*, or *Wish* spell also ends it.

You are made aware whenever the creature takes damage as a result of the contract or if the contract is ended.

You may maintain a number of contracts equal to your Charisma modifier. If you attempt to make a contract when you already at your maximum, you must end one immediately or the new contract fails.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you take a long rest.

#### Council Security
Starting at 10th level, you learn how to keep your plans under wraps.  Your thoughts and those of creatures under your contracts can't be read by any means unless you allow it. 

Additionally, you are immune to being charmed, and creatures under your contracts have advantage on saving throws against being charmed unless you allow it.

#### Blind Obedience
Starting at 14th level, you can force creatures that deify you to beg for forgiveness. 

When a creature targets you with an attack or a harmful spell, you may use your reaction to force it to make a Wisdom saving throw. It has disadvantage on the throw unless you have attacked it or targeted it with a harmful spell within the last 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature falls prone and is charmed by you for the next minute. While charmed this way, the creature is restrained. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends when you or your companions do anything harmful to it.

Once you use this ability on a creature, it becomes immune to it for the next 24 hours.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier, and regain all uses after completing a long rest.
