## Bard College

### College of Pacts
Bards seek out ancient secrets and gain magical knowledge from varied sources.  The bardic college structure helps focus their training on specific subjects curbs their risk of straying down more dangerous paths throughout their studies.  However, some bards do stray from the prescribed paths of the other colleges.  This tradition is known informally as the college of pacts, and bards who choose it plumb forbidden secrets and forge connections with powerful beings to gain knowledge beyond the reach of most other bards.  These bards believe that no secret should remain buried, no matter how dark or dangerous, and that it always pays to have powerful friends in high (or low) places. 

#### Plumb the Forbidden
When you join the College of Pacts at 3rd level, you learn dark magics normally associated with the warlock class.  When your Spellcasting feature lets you learn a bard cantrip or a bard spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the warlock spell list or the bard spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a bard spell for you.

#### Otherworldy Favor
At 3rd level, you can call upon the various otherworldly contacts you've made to grant you eldritch power when you need it.  If you would cast a spell you know from the warlock spell list of 1st or 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to call upon a favor from one of your otherworldly connections to empower the spell. Roll your Bardic Inspiration die, and increase the level at which the spell is cast by the half of the result (rounded up).

The magnitude of your request effects the difficulty of calling in your otherworldly favor. If you are casting a 2nd level spell, roll the Bardic Inspiration die twice and use the lower result.


#### Eldritch Secrets
Starting at 6th level, you've plumbed secrets usually known only to warlocks.  You learn two eldritch invocations of your choice that you meet the prerequisites for. If choose a invocation that lets cast a spell using a warlock spell slot. You use a bard spell slot instead

Additionally, whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.

#### Pact Master
Starting a 14th level, you may use your Otherworldy Favor feature when casting a spell of 3rd, 4th or 5th level.  When you use your feature this way, you do not expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration die to increase the level at which the spell is cast.  Instead, the level at which the spell is cast is increased by 1d4.    

If you apply this feature to a 3rd level spell, roll the d4 twice and use the highest result.

If you apply this feature to a 5th level spell, roll the d4 twice and use the lowest result.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
