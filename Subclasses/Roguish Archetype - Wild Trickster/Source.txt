### Wild Trickster


#### Spellcasting
When you reach 3rd level, you augment your martial prowess with the ability to cast spells.

**Cantrips.** You learn two cantrips of your choice from the Bards spell list. You learn another Bard cantrip of your choice at 10th level.

**Spell Slots.** The Wild Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher.  To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  For example, if you know the 1st level * Charm Person* and have a 1st-level and 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast ***Charm Person*** using either slot.

**Spells Known of 1st-Level and Higher.** You know three 1st-level bard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the enchantment or Illusion spells on the bard spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Wild Trickster Spellcasting table shows when you learn more bard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an enchantment or illusion spell of your choice and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the bard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the bard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an enchantment or illusion spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a charisma spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div align="center"> 

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma  modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier

#### Trickster Shape
Starting at 3rd level, you can use a action to magically assume the shape of any small or tiny beast that you have seen before. You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

Your level in this class determines the beasts you can transform into, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 3nd level, for example, you can transform into any small or tiny beast that has a challenge rating of 0 that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed and is no larger then small.

##### Spellthief Spellcasting
| Level | Max CR | Limitations |Example|
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:------------:|:---:|
| 3rd         | 0              | No flying or swimming speed no larger then tiny           | cat   |
| 6th         | 1/8             | No flying speed no larger then small           | Poisonous Snake   |
| 9th         | 1/4             | -      no larger then medium      | Blood Hawk   |

You can stay in a beast shape for one hour. You then revert to your normal form. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:

Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can’t use them.

When you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

You can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a spell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking actions that are part of a spell, such as Heat Metal, that you’ve already cast.

You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that sense.

You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the DM decides whether it is practical for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it. Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave the form.

#### Unassuming Demise

At 9th level, your attacks in your Trickster Shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. In addition while Your natural weapon attacks while you are transformed with Trickster Shape, you can apply your Sneak Attack. You also you don't need advantage on the attack roll to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if you are two sizes smaller then it.

#### Voice of the Wild
Beginning at 13th level, You can now speak while in any shape you assume using Trickster Shape. In addition, you can cast many of your bard spells of 5th level or lower in any shape you assume using Trickster Shape. You can ignore the somatic components of your bard spells, as well as any material components that lack a cost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both your normal shape and your any shape you assume using Trickster Shape.


#### Master of Mischief
At 17th level, You magics to trick and slip by unnoticed reach their full potential. You can the following spells, without expending a spell slot: Passwall, Mislead, or Modify Memory. They count as bard spells for you.

Once you cast a spell this way, you can't cast it again until you finish a long rest.
