## Sacred Oath

### Oath of Lore 
Paladins who take this oath devote themselves to historical study as well as the collection and safekeeping of lost lore.  Their quests often involve journeying into dangerous ruins to recover lost relics and restore forgotten history.  

These paladins are well versed in military history, deploying martial techniques that have been passed down through generations.   They can even call upon the spirits of champions from bygone ages to aid them in times of need.  Those who challenge this paladin donâ€™t face one champion but the combined might of champions from generations past. 

#### Tenets of Lore
The tenets of the Oath of Lore drive these paladins to draw from the wisdom of the past so they may secure a better future.

**Illuminate History.** The sands of time will bury the past if allowed to run their course.  You must preserve history's knowledge and lessons.

**Enthusiastic Study.** History is filled with mighty figures and great deeds for you to learn from. Stand upon the shoulders of giants, and you will reach new heights.

**Make Your Mark.** History is an ongoing process we all contribute towards. Use your time wisely and pave the way for future generations.

**Reduce to Memory.** Do not flinch when studying the horrors of the past. History's most important lessons are cloaked in terror and tragedy. It is your duty to put an end to any who would repeat them.

#### Blade Historian
When you take this oath at 3rd level, though studies of war and consultation with ancient warrior spirits, you've learned two maneuvers of your choice from among those available to the Battle Master archetype in the fighter class. 

If the maneuver requires a saving throw, the saving throw DC equals your spell save DC.  You learn an additional maneuver at 7th, 15th, and 20 level.  Any time you gain a paladin level, you may replace one of the maneuvers you know with a different maneuver.

If a paladin feature would provide you with one or more superiority die, they are d8s.  When you reach 15th level, they become d10s, and at 20th level they become d12s.

#### Oath Spells
You gain Historian spells at the paladin levels listed.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity Options.

**War Echoes.** You can use your Channel Divinity to tap into ancient knowledge. As a bonus action, you call upon the experiences of long-gone warriors to provide you aid in combat.  You are granted 3 superiority dice.  Each die lasts for one hour, or until you use it to fuel a combat maneuver, you know.  

**Spirit Summoning.** You can use your Channel Divinity to summon a spirit or construct of the past to help with your endeavors.  As a bonus action, you cast *find familiar* without any components. The familiar created this way has the following additional traits:

* Its creature type is changed to construct or undead (your choice).
* It is immune to poison and psychic damage, and is also immune to the charmed, frightened, and poisoned conditions.
* You may have its hit points become equal to (2 x your paladin level) + 4.
* While you are within 60 feet of it, you may ritual cast your paladin spells.

 A familiar created this way lasts an hour before vanishing.

#### Aura of Insight 
When you reach 7th level, you gain proficiency in one of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, or Religion. If you already have proficiency in the chosen skill, you gain double proficiency instead.

Additionally, you emanate an aura that grants you insight into the secrets of those around you. When you start your turn, you may choose a creature within 10 feet of you that you can see.  The DM tells you one of the following characteristics about that creature of your choice:

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

*	The creature's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score. You also learn if the creature is proficient with saving throws for the chosen attribute.
*	If the creature has resistance, immunity, or vulnerability to a given damage type.
*	If the creature has immunity to a given condition.
*	The creature's current hit points.
*	The creature's armor class.
*	If the creature is proficient in a given skill.
*	The total class levels of the creature, if any.

A creature that is immune to divination magic or can't be perceived through magical scrying sensors is immune to this effect.

At 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet, and you can choose another skill from this ability's list with which to gain proficiency.

#### Reconstruct History
When you reach 15th level, you are a master of old relics and of understanding how they function. You gain the following benefits:

* You can attune to up to four magic items at once.

* You ignore all class, race, spell and level requirements on attuning to or using a magic item.

* You can choose to consume a spell scroll of 5th level or lower that is on your person to use your Divine Smite feature and add damage to the smite as though you had expended a spell slot of an equivalent level spell to the scroll's spell level.

#### Ageless Guardian
Starting at 20th level, you can channel heroic figures of the past to embody their legendary deeds. As a bonus action, you can choose one of the following figure archetypes and gain benefits for the next 10 minutes based on the chosen archetype:
<br><br>

**The Sage.** 
* Whenever you use your Aura of Insight feature, you learn about three attributes from the target instead of one.

* Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.

* Up to three times while in this state, when you or a creature within 60 feet of you who can hear you makes an ability check, you can use your reaction to roll 2d6 and add the result to the ability check's result. You can choose to wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the feature but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

**The Mystic.** 

* You learn two cantrips of your choice from the cleric spell list. They count as paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. 

* Whenever you cast a paladin spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can make one weapon attack as part of that action.

* Once while in this state, you may cast 5th level or lower paladin spell without expending a spell slot. 


**The Warrior.** 

* You immediately gain 3 superiority dice, and if you start your turn without any superiority dice, you gain one superiority die.

* Whenever you roll a superiority die, you may roll it twice and choose the higher result.  

* If you would be forced to make a saving throw, you can expend a superiority die by rolling it and adding it to the result rolled for the save.  You can choose to wait until after you roll the d20 before deciding to use the superiority die but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.
