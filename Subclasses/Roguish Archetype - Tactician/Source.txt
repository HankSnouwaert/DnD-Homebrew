## Roguish Archetype

### Tactician
A Tactician may very well tell you they would just as soon not
be close enough to the battle to be considered a combatant,
preferring to win their fights before it ever gets to that stage,
but one would be a fool to underestimate how dangerous they
are once on the battlefield.

While they might have laid their plans in advance, their
sharp minds can quickly pick apart how their foes try to fight
against them and effortlessly pierce the crude tactics that
would be used against them and their allies.

What tends to mark a Tactician is a keen mind and a
willingness to plan ahead... in great detail. Adventurers with a
tactician among them are near impossible to pin down, as
they will always find a way to turn the tables.


#### Tactician's Cunning
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in the History and Investigation skills as well as one Gaming Set of your choice.

Additionally, you can give yourself a bonus to your
initiative rolls equal to your Intelligence modifier.
You can exchange your total on this roll with a
willing friendly creature within 60 feet.

#### Tactical Insight
Starting at 3rd level, you can tactically assess a creature's
options. As a bonus action, make an Intelligence
(Investigation) check contested by a Charisma (Deception)
check against any creature you can see within 60 feet.
On a success, you can see through their tactics, granting
one of the following effects:

* **Determine Attack.** You can cause them to have
disadvantage on their next attack against a creature that
can see or hear you.

* **Predict Movement.** You deduce where they are planning
to move on their next turn. They can choose to change
their plans, but if they move anywhere else, their
movement speed is reduced by 10 feet as they scramble to
adapt.

* **Outwit Response.** You can find a find their openings,
negating their ability to use their reaction until the end of
their next turn.

* **Expose Weakness:** You can grant
advantage against that target as part of the bonus action.

#### Tactical Strike
Starting at 9th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Tactical Insight ability, the attack you or a friendly creature makes against it before the start of your next turn deals an additional 2d6 damage.

You also gain an additional way to use your Sneak Attack: you don't need advantage on the attack to use your Sneak Attack against a creature if that creature has failed its saving throw against your Tactical Insight feature since the end of your last turn.

#### Shift the Field
Starting at 13th level, as an action you can move to 5 creatures that can see or hear you up to half their movement without provoking attacks of opportunity.  These creatures must be friendly or have failed their save against your Tactical Insight ability since the end of your last turn.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all expended uses after completing a long rest.

#### Unstoppable Schemes
Starting at 17th level, allies being moved by your Shift the Field feature may move through the space of other creatures, including enemy creatures, without suffering any movement penalties or attacks of opportunity.

Additionally, when you use your Tactical Insight feature, you may target two creatures or apply two effects to one creature.
