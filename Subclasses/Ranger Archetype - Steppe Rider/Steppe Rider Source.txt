## Ranger Archetype

### Steppe Rider
These rangers are renowned for their deadly skill in mounted combat and archery.  They weave in and out of battle atop their steed while unleashing volleys of arrows upon their comparably sluggish foes.  Steppe riders earn their name from the harsh plains where they are raised, and many of them travel to distant lands to serve in mercenary bands or brutal conquering armies.

#### Superior Steed
*3rd level Steppe Rider Feature*<br>
You may cast the *find steed* spell once per day without expending a spell slot.  When you cast *find steed* this way, it gains the following benefits:

* Your steed's hit points maximum is increased by 3 x your ranger level

* Your steed is difficult to pin down during a fight.  While you are mounted on the steed, it can use its reaction to move up to 10 feet when a creature you can see ends its turn within 20 feet of you.  This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks against you or your steed.

* When you gain your Land's Stride feature at 8th level and Vanish feature at 14th level, your steed gains them.

#### Rapid Fire
*3rd level Steppe Rider Feature*<br>
When you take the attack action with a ranged weapon that lacks the heavy property and haven't moved during this turn, you can attack twice instead of once. Your speed then becomes 0 until the end of the turn.

At 5th level, the number of attacks you can make using this feature increases to three.

#### High Speed Barrage
*7th level Steppe Rider Feature*<br>
If you make a ranged weapon attack against a creature that you've already made a ranged weapon attack against this turn and you're at least 25 feet away from the location of your last ranged weapon attack against it, the attack has advantage.

#### Melee Marksman
*11th level Steppe Rider Feature*<br>
Enemies engaging you at a close range no longer hampers your ranged capabilities.  You gain the following benifits:

* When a creature you can see within 25 feet of you moves towards you, you can use your reaction to make a ranged attack against it.

* Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls with ranged weapons that lack the heavy property.

* When a hostile creature's movement provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can make the attack with a ranged weapon.

#### Psychological Warfare
*15th level Steppe Rider Feature*<br>
Your arrows no longer target just the body but also your target's psyche, allowing you to frighten or goad your opponents with your barrages. 

When you hit a creature with three ranged attacks on the same turn, you may force it to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC.   On a failure, you may subject the creature to one of the following effects:

* Until the start of its next turn, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you and your steed while you are within its line of sight, and the creature can't willingly move closer to you or your steed.  A creature that can't be frightened is immune to this effect.

* Until the start of its next turn, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against creatures other than you and your steed while you are within its line of sight, and the creature can't willingly move away from you or your steed.  A creature that can't be charmed is immune to this effect.
