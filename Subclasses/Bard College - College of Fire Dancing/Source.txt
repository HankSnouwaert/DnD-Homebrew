## Bard College

### College of Fire Dancing
Bards from the College of Fire Dancing are known for <br> their fantastic and often frightening pyrotechnic performances.  Skilled with flaming torches and fire magic like no other, these bards ride the line between breathtaking performance and fiery disaster, keeping their audiences on the edge of their seats the whole time.

These bards tend to be extreme thrill-seekers.  When they tire of their performing routines, they will often take up adventuring for long stretches of time as they seek to master their art in a variety of deadly new situations where their talents can truly flare.

#### Pyrotechnics
*3rd Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
When you join this college, you automatically learn *burning hands* and it no longer requires somatic components when you cast it. You also learn your choice of any cantrip from any spell list that deals fire damage and no other damage type.  These count as bard spells for you and don't count against your total number of known spells.

Additionally, whenever you would learn a new spell or cantrip from the bard spell list, you may instead learn a spell or cantrip from any class spell list of the equivalent level that deals damage.  This spell must deal only fire damage, and it now counts as a bard spell for you.



#### Torch Master
*3rd Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
You gain mastery with torches.  You may treat lit torches as simple weapons with which you are proficient, they may serve as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells, and you may also light a torch as part of an attack you make with it.  

Lit torches deal 1d6 fire damage and have the finesse, light, and thrown (range 20/60) properties.

Additionally, when you cast a cantrip that deals fire damage, you may make one weapon attack with a torch as a bonus action.  You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of this bonus attack unless that modifier is negative.

#### Light up the Stage
*3rd Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
You may use an action to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to turn the battlefield into a burning stage.  

When you use your action this way, you begin drawing a 5-foot wide, 5-foot tall line of fire along a surface anywhere within 10 feet of you.  The line does not need to be straight, but it must be continuous and can be up to 20 ft. in length.  You draw the line over the course of your turn, and you may use your movement as you create it.  The line is completed at the end of your turn or when it reaches its maximum length.

If you extend the line through a creature's space, it must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take fire damage equal to two rolls of your Bardic Inspiration die.  On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.  A creature must also make the saving throw when it moves into the space of the fire for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.  You can choose to have yourself or another creature within 15 feet of you that can hear you automatically succeed on any saving throws against this effect.  

The line of fire lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.

The maximum length of the line of fire and its height increase when you reach certain levels in this class, increasing to 30 ft long and 10 feet tall at 5th level, 40 ft long and 15 feet tall at 10th level, and 50 ft long and 20 feet tall at 15th level.

#### Fiery Virtuoso
*6th Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
You gain resistance to fire damage.  If you already have fire resistance from another source, you instead have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that would deal fire damage to you.  

Additionally, whenever you take fire damage or cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals fire damage, until the end of your next turn, you gain advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma (Performance) checks, and your torch attacks and cantrips that deal fire damage deal extra fire damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.  The extra fire damage caused by a cantrip this way is only applied to one creature of your choice that is damaged by the cantrip.

#### Awe Inspiring Inferno
*14th Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
When you start your turn, you may begin a grand performance of flame.  Until the start of your next turn, any time you hit a creature with an attack roll dealing fire damage or a creature fails a saving throw against one of your spells or abilities that deals fire damage, if you can see that creature, you can cause it to be frightened for 1 minute.  While frightened this way, the creature treats you and all sources of fire as the source of its fear. 

Creatures frightened this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the fear on a success.  If the creature can perceive a source of fire, it has disadvantage on this save.

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.
