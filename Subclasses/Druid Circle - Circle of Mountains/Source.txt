## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Mountains
Like the creatures of the world, druids often adapt to a specific environment they consider to be their home.  Druids of this circle prefer to make their homes in mountain ranges, and they often carry very isolationist attitudes.  Some prefer to roam the lower slopes and valleys while others make their homes among sheer cliffs and on the tallest of peaks.  Regardless of their preferences, these druids act with the stubborn implacability of the mountains they protect. 

#### Mountain Forms
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain access to the following wild shape forms at 2nd, 6th, 12th, 16th level.  The usual restrictions as to what you can wild shape into do not apply to these forms.  

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Grasslands Spells list.

| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option*      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Big Horn Sheep, Snow Leopard |
|  6th          | Black Bear, Teratornis      | 
|  12th          | Feldanost, Gorilla    |
|  16th          |  Giant Snow Leopard, Grizzly Bear    |

#### Mountain Spells
Your mystical connection to the grasslands infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Jump, Thunderous Smite |
|  3rd          | Spider Climb, Earthbind |
|  5th          | Erupting Earth, Meld Into Stone      | 
|  7th          | Stone Shape, Stoneskin     |
|  9th          | Transmute Rock, Wall of Stone    |

#### Cliff Dweller
At 2nd level, you gain a climb speed equal to your walking speed and you have resistance to fall damage.

#### Primal Weapons
At 6th level, if you have magic weapon merge into any of your wild shapes, your attacks in wild shape form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Crag Caller
Starting at 6th level, you may use your action to summon a rock formation, causing it to burst from a location on the ground that you can see within 100 feet. The rock formation has a diameter of 30 feet at its base and reaches 30 feet high at its peak. The location on the ground where it appears must be wide enough on all sides to accommodate the entire base of the rock formation. It cannot be summoned in an area occupied by a gargantuan creature or object. 

The rock formation is considered difficult terrain for all creatures without a climb speed. It has an AC 16 and hit points equal to ten times your druid level. When reduced to 0 hit points, a rock formation crumbles into dust.

If a rock formation is prevented from reaching its full height due to reaching ceiling or other obstacle, it stops as soon it encounters any strong resistance, such as hitting roof.  The rock formation cannot restrain creatures by pinning them against another surface.

Once you have used this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3th level or higher to use it again.

#### Avatar of the Mountains
At 10th level, you can use your wild shape to transform into a Terror Goat*, Gigantopithecus*, Zheng*, or Kamaitachi* for 1 hour. You can use your wild shape this way 3 times per day, and regain all uses after completing a long rest. 

#### Stance of Mountains
 Starting at 14th level, you and creatures of your choice can move across difficult terrain made of earth or stone that was created or effected by your druid spells and abilities, without spending extra movement.  
 
 Additionally, you and creatures of your choice can move through this earth or stone as if it were air and without destabilizing it.  Creatures can't end their movement inside this material, and anyone who does is ejected to the nearest unoccupied space, and stunned until the end of their next turn.

The **feldunost** is a species of giant ram capable of living in extremely harsh mountain environments.  Far outsizing other mundane mountain creatures, this ram can deliver bone shattering blows with its skull.  This combined with their mountain climbing agility deters almost all other mountain creatures from attempting to hunt them.  Mountain dwarves will often use captured delunost for agricultural use and as fearsome and dependable mounts when traversing their rocky homes.

<br>

The **gigantopithecus** is the largest ape to ever live.  Long ago they roamed lush forests where their size and strength made them more than a match for any would-be predators.  Now they have all but disappeared. Though they are believed to have died out long ago, travelers may stumble across long lost colonies hidden away on remote mountain slopes.   

\columnbreak

<br>

Though gigantopithecus are generally peaceful herbivores, should their ire be roused, they are more than capable of pummeling most other animals and humanoids into a bloody pulp.

> ***Whirlwind Movement.*** When the kamaitachi moves at least 30 feet in a straight line, it may choose to transform itself into a swirling mass of rushing wind. It may stay in this state until it becomes incapacitated or ends a turn in which it did not move at least 30 feet in a straight line.  While in this state it gains the following benefits:
> * It is immune to the grappled, paralyzed, petrified, prone, and restrained conditions
> * It has resistance to piercing and slashing damage
> * It can occupy the space of hostile creatures and move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing
> * Attack rolls against it have disadvantage and it does not provoke attacks of opportunity
>
> If the kamaitachi reverts back into its normal state while inside a space it is too large to occupy, it is immediately shunted to the nearest space that it can occupy and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it moved.
>
> ***Avoidance.*** If the kamaitachi is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
>
> ***Float.*** The kamaitachi can choose to hover 5 feet above the ground and is under the effects of the *Feather Fall* spell at all times unless it is incapacitated.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The kamaitachi makes three attacks and can use each of its attack options once.
>
> ***Trip Attack.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d4 + 6) slashing damage.  If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ***Sickle Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (3d4 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Numbing Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d4 + 6) slashing damage.  The target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned until the end of its next turn.  If this attack reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it is stable but poisoned for 1 hour, even after regaining hit points, and is paralyzed while poisoned this way.

These bizarre mountain dwelling creatures appear to be floating weasels with scythe-like blades in place of their forelimbs.  They float through the air, and when they pick up speed they can morph into a swirling mass of wind.  The **kamaitashi** roams mountain passes looking for potential victims it can attack, preferably under the cover of a snowstorm.  When it attacks, the **kamaitashi** first trips its target, then slashes the victim with its scythe arms.  Finally, and most bizarrely of all, the **kamaitashi** makes an attack that applies a numbing "medicine" to the target.  While this numbing agent does prevent the victim from dying from its wounds, it also leaves it poisoned for the remaining duration.  After making these attacks, the **kamaitashi** will often flee, only to return later so it can continue to torment its victims.

These monstrous birds resemble giant condors and use their massive talons and beaks to hunt down small land animals.  Their size and fearsome dispositions also allow them to drive other predators, making the **teratornis** quite adapt a stealing kills.  Those traveling through remote, mountainous terrain, must take care that they don't attract the ire of a **teratornis.**

The *ivory goat of terror* is a magical figurine known to summon a goat that induces dread in those who view it.  This item has gained popularity amongst adventures and crafters leading to more widespread use of its creation.  What few realize is that this item was inspired by an actual mountain dwelling monstrosity.  

The terror goat is a rare, but terrifyingly malevolent creature possessed of a single minded determination to obliterate anything and everything in its path.  Whether it is attacking creatures, objects, or structures, the terror goat relentlessly smashes until nothing is left.  Like the item based off of it, this monster radiates an aura of terror that will leave all but the bravest of individuals quaking in fear before its wrath.

The **zheng** can also choose not to engage its prey directly while they are in its mountain domain.  It possess a supernatural roar, which cannot be heard, but shatters stone.  The **zheng** will use this to cause avalanches which batter and bury its victims who usually have no idea what caused the landslide.  While its victims are injured and confused, the **zheng** will strike, quickly finishing off its prey.
