## Artificer Specialist 

### Arsonist
These artificers have focused their craft on the creation and manipulation of fire.  Unlike other spellcasters who conjure and hurl flame from a distance, arsonists wade into the fray, surrounded by the scorching fires of their making.  These fires are created through the use of an arcane flamethrower, and arsonists survive the blazing melee with the aid of a specially crafted suit of flame armor.  Arsonists can quickly spread their flames across large areas through the aid of flammable oils they launch across the battlefield and upon their foes.  

These pyromaniac artificers are often seen as dangerously unhinged, and many are dismayed by the amount of burning collateral damage they leave in their wake.  Whether their fires are excessive or their tactics are reckless is of little concern to an arsonist; they get the job done and have fun doing it.

#### Tools of the Trade
*3rd level Arsonist Feature*<br>
You gain proficiency with heavy armor and with your choice of smith's tools or alchemist tools. If you already have both these tool proficiencies, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tools of your choice.

#### Arsonist Spells
*3rd level Arsonist Feature*<br>
You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Arsonist Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

#### Flame Suit
*3rd level Arsonist Feature*<br>

You learn how to integrate your fiery weapons into a combat suit.  Over a long rest, you can turn a suit of armor into a Flame Suit, provided you have smith's tools or alchemist's tools on hand and you are proficient with the tools.

You gain the following benefits while wearing this Flame Suit:

* If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the Flame Suit lacks this requirement.

* You can use the Flame Suit as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.

* The armor attaches to you and can't be removed against your will.  It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action.

* You have resistance to fire damage and immunity to fire damage caused by your artificer spells and abilities.

* The armor has a built-in flamethrower.  It counts as a two-handed simple ranged weapon with a range of 10/20 feet that deals 1d8 fire damage on hit.  You use your Intelligence modifier for its attack and damage rolls, and only you are proficient with the weapon.  Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your flamethrower's attack rolls.  The flamethrower counts as a separate item from your Flame Suit for the purposes of your Artificer Infusions.

The armor continues to be a Flame Suit until you convert another suit of armor into a Flame Suit, at which point it reverts back to its original form.  You can also revert it back to its original form over the course of a short or long rest.

#### Fuel the Flame
*3rd level Arsonist Feature*<br>

You learn how to produce and expel flammable liquids.  When you make a Flame Suit, you may attach a fuel tank to the armor.  The tank holds a number of fuel charges equal to your 1 + your artificer level and regains all charges when you complete a long rest.

As an action, you can expend a charge to lunch a glob of fuel at a point within 20 feet of you.  The fuel covers any surface in a 10-foot square centered at that point and turns it into difficult terrain for 1 minute before drying up.  When the fuel lands, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save (which it can choose to fail) or be covered in fuel for 1 minute.  Creatures covered in fuel have their speed reduced by 5 feet.  Fuel can also be removed from a creature if it or another creature within 5 feet uses an action to scrap or wash it off.  

If an attack, spell, or ability that deals fire damage targets something in a fuel-covered area or has an area of effect that overlaps with a fuel-covered area, any fuel in that area is set ablaze; this includes fuel that is covering creatures in that area.  All other fuel-covered areas and fuel-covered creatures in contact with an area of burning fuel are also immediately set ablaze as the fire spreads across all the fuel it comes in contact with.

When a creature starts its turn in an area of burning fuel, or it starts its turn ablaze with burning fuel, it takes 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier fire damage.  A creature can only take damage from your burning fuel once during its turn.

While wearing your Flame Suit, you ignore the difficult terrain created by your fuel and don't have your speed reduced by being covered in fuel.

#### Extra Fire Power
*5th level Arsonist Feature*<br>
Your flamethrower has been enhanced to spread flames more efficiently.  When you take the attack action with your flamethrower, you now have the following options:

* **Rapid Fire** - You make two attacks with your flamethrower.  You may replace any number of these attacks with uses of your Fuel the Flame feature, expending a fuel charge for each use.
* **Burning Stream** - You unleash a roaring jet of fire from your flamethrower.  Make a separate attack against each creature in a 15-foot cone with your flamethrower.  Alternatively, you can expend a fuel charge to cover a 15-foot cone in the fuel described by your Fuel the Flame feature.
* **Flame Slam** -  You slam your flamethrower in front of you, scorching nearby enemies.  Make a separate attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you with your flamethrower.  Alternatively, you can expend a fuel charge to cover each space within 5 feet of you with the fuel described by your Fuel the Flame feature (including the space you're occupying).

#### Pyromania
*9th level Arsonist Feature*<br>
Your flames now invigorate and embolden you.  If you would take fire damage from your burning fuel, you instead take no damage and gain a number of temporary hit points equal to the fire damage you would have taken.  You also gain a +1 bonus to your AC and saving throws while standing in an area covered by your burning fuel.

Additionally, while you are conscious, friendly creatures within 60 feet of you are immune to fire damage caused by your artificer spells and abilities, and they ignore difficult terrain caused by your fuel.

#### Pyromastery
*15th level Arsonist Feature*<br>
You've perfected the potency of your flamethrower and flammable fuel, granting you the following benefits:

* The range of the flamethrowers becomes 20/40 feet, and it now deals 1d12 fire damage on hit.
* Fuel created by your artificer abilities now deals 1d12 + your Intelligence modifier fire damage when set ablaze. 
* You can lunch a glob of fuel with your Fuel the Flames feature up to 40 feet away.
* When you use your Burning Stream attack option, you can increase its area to a 20-foot cone.
* When you use your Flame Slame attack option, you can move up to 15 feet along the ground in a straight line before you make your slam.
