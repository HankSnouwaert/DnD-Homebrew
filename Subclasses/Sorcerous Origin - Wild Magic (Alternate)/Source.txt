## Sorcerous Origin

### Wild Magic (Alternate)
Your innate magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation.  You might have endured exposure to raw magic, perhaps through a planar portal leading to Limbo, the Elemental Plans, or the Far Realm.  Perhaps you were blessed by a fey being or marked by a demon.  Or your magic could be a fluke of your birth, with no apparent cause.  However it came to be, this magic churns within you, waiting for an outlet.

Choose a Wild Magic Origin that best suits your character's back story: Fey, Demonic, or Conflux.  This determines which Chaos Surge Table and what Wild Magic Surge table you will use for your class features. 

If you are playing the Sorcerer variant with Origin Spells, this also determines which Origin Spells you gain access to.

#### Chaos Surge
Starting when you choose this origin at 1st level, you may call upon surges of chaotic magic, allowing you to cast a spell at random.

As a wild magic sorcerer, you have access to a Chaos Surge table that contains spells you can attempt to cast. Use the Chaos Surge Table that best matches your wild magic origin.

You may attempt to gain access to a spell from the 1st Level column of your Chaos Surge table by expending a 1st level spell slot or 1 sorcery point at the end of your turn and rolling 1d8.  Until the end of your next turn, you may cast the spell matching the result of your roll without expending a spell slot.  If you roll an 8, you don't gain access to a spell and instead roll on your Wild Magic Surge table.

If a result of the Wild Magic Surge table calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to your spell save DC.

When you gain the ability to cast 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th level spells, you may roll of any of the corresponding columns by expending a spell slot or a number of Sorcery Points equal to the column's level.  

> ##### Making Your Own Chaos Surge Table
> At your DM's discretion, you may customize your Chaos Surge Table by replacing any spell in a given column with another spell whose spell level matches that column's level.

#### Spell Warping
Starting at 6th level, you have the ability to twist chaotic magic with ease. You learn an additional Meta Magic option.  Also, when you apply a meta magic option to a spell you cast using the Chaos Surge feature, it costs 1 sorcery point less, down to a minimum of 0. 

\columnbreak

#### Bend Chaos
At 14th level, you gain a modicum of control over the surges of your magic. Whenever you roll on the Chaos Surge column, you can roll the die twice and choose which of the two spell you cast. If you roll the same number on both dice, you don't gain access to a spell and instead roll on your Wild Magic Surge table.
In addition, when you roll on the Wild Magic Table, you may chose to reroll the result. You must use the new result.

#### Wild Resurgence
Beginning at 18th level, the chaotic magic that comes from you is near endless and can recharge your magical reserves. Before you roll on one of your Chaos Surge columns, you can regain 6 sorcery points and then roll on the Wild Magic table after you cast the spell. 

If the Chaos Surge roll results Wild Magic Surge, you gain back 10 sorcery points instead and roll twice on the Wild Magic table. (Resolve each Wild Magic table roll one at a time)

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.

##### Wild Magic Surge Table 1 - 4 (Demonic)
| d20   | Effect |
|:-----:|:----------:|
|   1   | Your face becomes warped and horribly disfigured. You become blinded and cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. You may make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of your turns to end the effect. | 
|   2   |   You become crippled as your body mutates into strange and unnatural shapes.  You are under the effects of the *slow* spell.  You may make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of your turns to end the effect. |  
|   3   |  A torrent of multicolored fire erupts from your mouth and covers your form.  Roll 3d6 and call heads or tails before flipping a coin.  If you guessed the coin result, you gain temporary hit points equal to result.  If you lose, you take force damage equal to the result.|
|   4   | You are pulled through an abyssal rift and hurtled through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. You must then make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 2d10 psychic damage on a failure and half as much damage on a success. | 
|   5   | Your mind is consumed by murderous rage. You must choose one enemy that you can see. You can't target any other creature with attacks or spells, and you can't willingly move away from it. This effect ends after 1 minute has passed, or the creature dies.|
|   6   | A 10-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from you. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. | 
|   7   | For the next hour, your blood becomes as thick and black as tar.  Each time you take 5 or more piercing or slashing damage, the area within 5 feet of you becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.| 
|   8   | You cast *confusion* centered on yourself. | 
|   9   | You are consumed by a maddening bloodlust.  You move up to your speed towards the nearest creature you can see and make a melee spell attack against it.  On hit, the creature takes 3d8 force damage.  If one or more creatures are equally close to you, you may choose which one you attack.   | 
|   10  | A portal opens and pulls three Manes into an unoccupied space of your choice on the ground within 40 feet of you.  They act right after your turn and are hostile to all creatures, including you.  The demons pursue and attack the nearest non-demons to the best of their ability.      |
|   11  |   Your skin becomes covered in boils and scabs.  You have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks but disadvantage on all other Charisma checks.  After 8 hours, your skin sheds, revealing fresh skin under it and ending the effect.   |
|   12  |   For the next 8 hours, your reflection appears as a demonic version of your self.     |
|   13  |    For the next hour, your eyes burn with dreadful flame, and onyx horns protrude from your head.  |  
|   14  |    For the next hour, any blood within 10 feet of you starts to slowly move towards you, where it pools at your feet.    |
|   15  |   A voice manifests in your head and offers you power for a price. You may roll any number of d4s. You then take necrotic damage equal to the total result and gain one 1 sorcery point back for each dice rolled.|
|   16  |  A portal temporarily opens at a point of your choice within 100 feet of you, and a demonic appendage strikes out, making a spell attack against a target at that point. On a hit, the target takes 3d10 force damage. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, it is pulled through the portal into the Abyss. |
|   17  |    You grow demonic wings, giving you a 20 foot fly speed for the next 10 minutes.|
|   18  |  	You are infused with fiendish vigor, granting you the effects of the *haste* spell for the next 10 minutes.    |
|   19  |    You grow an extra head.  While you have this head, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.  After an hour, the head detaches and falls apart into a gibbering mass of flesh.    |
|   20  |  Your hands become slime-covered claws. While you have these claws, you can use your action to make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target takes acid damage equal to 3d8 + your Charisma modifier. The claws disappear after 1 hour.      |

|:-----:|:----------:|
|   1   | Your face becomes warped and horribly disfigured. You become blinded and cannot speak or cast spells with verbal components. You may make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of your turns to end the effect. | 
|   2   |   You become crippled as your body mutates into strange and unnatural shapes.  You are under the effects of the *slow* spell.  You may make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of your turns to end the effect. |  
|   3   |  A torrent of multicolored fire erupts from your mouth and covers your form.  Roll 5d6 and call heads or tails before flipping a coin.  If you guessed the coin result, you gain temporary hit points equal to result.  If you lose, you take force damage equal to the result.|
|   4   | You are pulled through an abyssal rift and hurtled through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, you return to the space you previously occupied or the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. You must then make a Wisdom saving throw, taking 4d10 psychic damage on a failure and half as much damage on a success. | 
|   5   | Your mind is consumed by murderous rage. You must choose one enemy that you can see. You can't target any other creature with attacks or spells, and you can't willingly move away from it. This effect ends after 1 minute has passed, or the creature dies.|
|   6   | A 20-foot radius of disgusting green gas extends out from you. The gas spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. |
