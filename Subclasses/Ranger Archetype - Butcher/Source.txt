## Ranger Archetype

### Agent of Fate
Some see death as a force of nature, but it has its <br> own agents that act on its behalf. The rangers of <br> this  conclave are said to be able to see those who <br> have been chosen by death and bring their fate to <br> fruition. Some of these agents spend their lives training <br> to see the strings of fate that predict one’s death, believing they are helping right the wrongs that mortals and other fiends have used to try to subvert fate. Others of these conclaves seem to believe it is destiny, having at some point in their life begun to see the delicate strings that connect all life and also these strings needs to be cut. It is unclear whether this change in perspective was caused by a near-death experience or initiated by some god of death; all that is known is that when death marks its quarry, its hunters will find them.
