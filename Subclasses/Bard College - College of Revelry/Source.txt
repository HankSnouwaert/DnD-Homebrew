## Bard College

### College of Revelry
Bards are often known for their wild natures, love of parties, and tendency to upset the status quo.  However, the College of Revelry puts them all to shame.  Bards of this college live to cause disruption and chaos where ever they go treating anarchy as the ultimate party that everyone is invited to.

The performances of these bards thrive on audience participation, and they are notorious for escalating into full scale riots. 

While not necessary evil, these bards are always chaotic.  Sometimes they are violent anarchists who want to watch communities tear themselves apart in mob violence.  Other times they stand against oppressive governments who prioritize peace over joy and freedom.  Others are simply traveling joy seekers whose revels sometimes get out of hand.  In any case, these bards seek to liberate others from the oppressive monotony of their lives, and show them that sometimes, even peace is overrated. 

#### Bonus Proficiencies
When you join the College of Revelry at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with medium armor and your choice of a Glaive, Pike, Halberd, or Whip.

#### Gang Tactics
When you join the College of Reveler at 3rd level, you master overwhelming opponents from all sides.  Once per turn, you can deal an extra 1d4 damage to one creature you hit with a melee attack if another enemy of the target is within 5 feet of it and that enemy isn't incapacitated.

The amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this class, increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

#### Unleash
At 3rd level, as a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to make creature you can see within 30 feet of you make a wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. The creature may choose to fail this save. 

If it does fail, the creature uses its reaction to move up to its movement speed to the closest enemy it can see. If this movement brings the creature within range for a melee attack, the creature makes a melee attack against the enemy with advantage. If this attack hits, you may also roll your Bardic Inspiration die and add the result to the creature's damage roll. 

The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. Additionally, if the creature made the attack, the next attack roll against it has advantage until the end of your next turn.

#### Deviant Glee
Starting at 6th level, when a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to its ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or for you Unleash ability, you can can choose to have that creature make 3 rolls instead.  You then chose two of those dice, add them together, and use their result as the result for the Bardic Inspiration.  The creature then takes necrotic damage equal to the result of the third dice. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

#### Havoc Festival
Starting at 14th level, you may use an action to enter a riot inducing state for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated. When you enter this state, choose up to 6 creatures within 100 feet of you that can see or hear you.  While you are in this state, whenever one of those creatures takes their first action each turn, it may choose to take 1d10 necrotic damage and gain an additional action that turn.  This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way, and the extra action may only be used to make a single weapon attack, Dash, Disengage, Hide, cast a Cantrip, or Use an Object.

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you complete a short or long rest.
