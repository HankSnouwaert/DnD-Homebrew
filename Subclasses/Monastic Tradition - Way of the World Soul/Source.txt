## Monastic Tradition

### Way of the World Soul
Monks of this tradition see all life as interconnected through a grand spirit they often refer to as the World Soul.  By attuning themselves to the World Soul, these monks are able to gain and share strength through the innate connection all life has with itself. 

For these monks, ki energy is not something they alone possess, but something that can flow from one being to another as blood flows through a single body.  This allows them to share their ki power with their allies.


#### Voice of the Conclave
When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your understanding of how the World Soul connects all life allows you to more easily communicate with others. You can spend 1 ki points to cast *Comprehend Languages* or *Speak with Animals* without providing material components. At 5th level you can spend 2 ki points to cast  *Speak with Plants*.  

Spells cast this way have a duration of 10 minutes.


#### Soul Bond
At 3rd level, you learn how channel ki though others. As an action or bonus action, you can touch a willing creature to create a spiritual tether between you. The tether lasts for 10 minutes, until the target is reduced to 0 hit points, or until the target ends its turn more than 120 ft. from you.
While you are tethered to a creature, you gain the following benefits:

• You can speak telepathically to the creature. The creature understands you only if the two of you share a language.

• As part of your attack action, you may spend 1 ki point. If you do, until the end of the turn you can make unarmed strikes though any creature you are tethered to, and you can use your Flurry of Blows feature without spending ki points. The creature uses your attack modifiers and Martial Arts dice for the attack.

• The creature tethered to you can use one of your ki points to dodge, disengage or dash as a bonus action. You may choose to prevent the creature from using this feature.

You can maintain a number of simultaneous tethers equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

While you have no uses available, you can spend 1 ki point to use this feature again.

#### Collective Blessing
Starting at 6th level, the soul bond between you and your companions grows stronger.

When a creature you are tethered to makes an attack roll or a saving throw, you can use your reaction and spend 1 ki point to roll a Martial Arts dice and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. You may chose to do this after seeing the result of the tethered creature's roll, but before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

#### Pause for Reflection
Starting at 11th level, you can commune with the World Soul and allow the ki of all living creatures to flow through you.  

You can cast the *Commune with Nature* spell as a ritual. When you do so, you gain back ki points equal to the number of nonhostile creatures in the area that the spell effects.

Once you use this feature you can't use it again until you take a long rest.

#### Scion of Conclave
At 17th level, you can draw power from the collective ki energy of your allies. Whenever you or another creature spends a ki point on an ability from your Soul Bond or Collective Blessing feature, you get a d6 which you add to a pool of collective energy. You can have up to 5 dice in this pool. 

Whenever you hit with a unarmed strike or monk weapon, you can increase the damage dealt by spending dice from the pool. You can spend any number of dice you have available. Roll the spent dice and add the result as extra radiant damage to the attack.

If a minute passes with no new dice added to the pool, remove all dice from it.
