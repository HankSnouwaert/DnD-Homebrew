## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Twilight (Alternate)
The Circle of Twilight seeks to exterminate
undead creatures and preserve the natural cycle
of life and death that rules over the cosmos.
Their magic allows them to manipulate the
boundary between life and death, sending their
foes to their final rest while keeping their allies
from that fate.
These druids seek out lands that have been
tainted by undeath. Such places are grim and
foreboding. Once vibrant forests become gloomy,
haunted places devoid of animals and filled with
plants dying a slow, lingering death. The Circle of
Twilight goes to such places to banish undeath
and restore life.

#### Circle Spells
Your mystical connection to the cycle of life and death infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Shillelagh, Inflict Wounds, Protection from Evil and Good |
|  3rd          | Earthbind, Spiritual Weapon |
|  5th          | Vampiric Touch, Speak with Dead      | 
|  7th          | Death Ward, Guardian of Nature    |
|  9th          | Steel Wind Strike, Dispel Evil and Good  |

#### Scythe of Twilight
Beginning at 2nd level, you can wield a scythe infused with your magics that aids you in hunting the undead.  You can create this scythe or bond your self with an existing one by performing a 1 hour ceremony.  This ceremony can be performed over a short or long rest, and after completing it, you lose your bond with the previous scythe, or it is destroyed if you created it using this feature.

A scythe you are bound to has the following properties:  

* It can serve as a spellcasting focus for your druid spells
* It can have Shillelagh cast on it as though it was a wooden club or quarterstaff.
* Druid spells and attacks made with it ignore resistance or immunity to necrotic damage if the target is undead.

#### Grim Harvest
At 2nd level, you gain the ability to harness necrotic power to unravel and harvest the life energy of other creatures. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature in to empower your Bounded Scythe with a number of charges equal to your druid level. When you make a melee weapon attack with the Bounded Scythe or melee spell attack with a druid spell, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra 1d10 necrotic damage to any target you hit.

The charges lasts for 10 minutes. They are removed early if you dismiss them (no action required), die, or use this feature again.

#### Voice of the Fallen
At 6th level, your connection with the dead runs deeper than language. When you cast *Speak with Dead*, you always understand what the target of this casting says and it always understands your questions, even if you don't share a language with it or it isn't intelligent enough to speak.

#### Twilight Reaping
At 6th level, your mastery over your scythe becomes even greater. You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn as long as both attacks are with your Bounded Scythe, while your Grim Harvest feature is active, you can spend 1 charge to cast one of your cantrips in place of one of those attacks.

#### Watcher at the Threshold
Beginning at 10th level, you gain additional uses for the charges granted by your Grim Harvest feature 
* When you or a creature within 60 feet of you takes poison, necrotic, cold, or psychic damage, you can use your reaction to spend 1 charge to grant resistance to the creature against that instance of the damage.
* When you or a creature within 60 feet of makes a death saving throw, you can use your reaction to spend 1 charge  to stabilize that creature.

#### Paths of the Dead
At 14th level, your mastery of death allows you to walk paths usually reserved for the dead. When you activate your Grim Harvest feature, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while your Bonded Scythe has charges, you can spend 1 or more charges to cast *Etherealness*.  The spell's duration lasts a number of minutes equal to the number of charges you spent to cast it, and you can end the spell as a bonus action.

##### Scythe
Scythes are simple weapons that weigh 4 lb and cost 2 gp. They deal 1d6 slashing damage and have the reach, and two-handed properties.
