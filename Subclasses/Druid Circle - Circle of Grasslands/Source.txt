## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Grasslands
Like the creatures of the world, druids often adapt to a specific environment they consider to be their home.  Druids of this circle live in open planes and grasslands, running free amongst the creatures there.  These druids defend their open homes from poachers and others that would sully the open freedom of the planes with the cage of civilization.  
These druids specialize in adapting animals forms suited to charging across large open areas.  When given a sufficient runway, these druids become high speed battering rams capable of sending their foes flying of their feet.

#### Grassland Forms
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain access to the following wild shape forms at 2nd, 6th, 12th, 16th level.  The usual restrictions as to what you can wild shape into do not apply to these forms.  

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Grasslands Spells list.

| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Warhorse, Pronghorn* |
|  6th          | Cheetah*, Lion*      | 
|  12th          | Giant Elk    |
|  16th          | Rhinoceros*    |

#### Grasslands Spells
Your mystical connection to the grasslands infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Expeditious Retreat, Longstrider |
|  3rd          | Warding Wind, Pass Without Trace |
|  5th          | Haste,  Thunder Step      | 
|  7th          | Freedom of Movement, Aura of Life     |
|  9th          | Control Winds, Dawn    |

#### Planes Runner
Also, starting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield.

#### Grace of Planes
Beginning at 6th level, you can use your action to cause the sweeping winds of the planes to whirl around you until the end of your turn.  While the winds are whirling around you this way, whenever you move within 5 feet of another creature, you may choose to heal that creature for 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier or deal 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier thunder damage to the creature.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>    

You may use any combination of either of these abilities up to six times this turn and only once per creature.
Once you have used this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3th level or higher to use it again.

#### Primal Weapons
At 6th level, if you have magic weapon merge into any of your wild shapes, your attacks in wild shape form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Avatar of the Planes
At 10th level, you can use your wild shape to transform into an Elephant*, Zephyr Horn*, or Bronzehide Lion* for 1 hour. You can wild shape this way 3 times per day, and regain all uses after completing a long rest. 

#### Sonic Charge
Starting at 14th level, you gain the ability charge at supersonic speeds, smashing through anything standing in your way.  As a bonus action, you may choose to move up to a 120 feet in a straight line along the ground. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity and you have advantage on dexterity saving throws while moving this way. 

Each creature that comes into contact with you while you are moving this way takes 5d10 thunder damage and must make a strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature is pushed to side of you, and is knocked prone.  On a successful save, the creature still takes the full damage but is not pushed to the side or knocked prone and you are stopped in your path.

Once you have used this action, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 5th level or higher to use it again.
