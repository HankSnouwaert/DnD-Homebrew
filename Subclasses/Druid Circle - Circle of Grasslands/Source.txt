## Druid Circle

### Circle of Grasslands
Like the creatures of the world, druids often adapt to a specific environment they consider to be their home.  Druids of this circle live in open plains and grasslands, running free amongst the creatures there.  These druids defend their open homes from poachers and others that would sully the open freedom of the plains with the cage of civilization.  

These druids specialize in adapting animals forms suited to charging across large open areas.  When given a sufficient runway, these druids become high speed battering rams capable of sending their foes flying of their feet.


#### Grasslands Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
Your mystical connection to grasslands infuses you with the ability to cast some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Grasslands Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 

##### Circle of Grasslands Spells 
| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *expeditious retreat*, *longstrider* |
|  3rd          | *incantation of protection**, *incantation of zeal** |
|  5th          | *crusader's mantle*, *haste*     | 
|  7th          | *aura of life*, *freedom of movement*      |
|  9th          | *circle of power*, *destructive wave*    |

#### Grassland Forms
*2nd Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
You can now use your Wild Shape feature to transform into unique grassland animal forms granted by this subclass, and when using your Wild Shape this way, you may use it as a bonus action. Detailed descriptions of these forms can be found in the Grasslands Wild Shapes section.

When shapeshifting into these forms, you can choose to either be Small or Medium. Starting at 10th level, you can also choose to be Large. 

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Grasslands Spells list and ignore their material component requirements.

You start knowing three of these forms: Antelope, Cheetah, Horse. Additional wild shape forms from this subclass become available at levels 4 and 8. 

##### Grasslands Wild Shape Options
| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Antelope, Cheetah, Horse |
|  4th          | Cape Buffalo, Giraffe, Lion       | 
|  8th          | Elephant, Rhino   |

#### Plains Runner
*2nd Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
Your speed increases by 10 feet while <br> you aren't wearing heavy armor or <br> wielding a shield.

Additionally, you gain an advantage on <br> Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) <br> checks relating to grasslands environments <br> and the life that inhabits them. You can also <br> speak with animals who dwell in grasslands <br> environments as though under the effects of <br> the *speak with animals* spell, and you have <br> advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) <br> checks made while interacting with them.


#### Sonic Charge
*6th Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
You gain the ability to charge at supersonic <br> speeds, smashing through anything standing in  <br> your way. As a bonus action, you may choose to <br> move up to 60 feet in a straight line along the <br> ground.

During this movement, you can move through <br> the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke <br> opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a <br> creature’s space, you are pushed into the nearest <br> unoccupied space.

Each creature whose space you move through must <br> make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save <br> DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 thunder <br> damage; on a successful save, it takes half as much <br> damage.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again <br> until you complete a long rest or expend a spell slot of <br> 3rd level or higher.




#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of Grasslands Feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Avatar of the Plains
*10th Level Circle of Tundra feature* <br>
When you use your Wild Shape feature to transform into one of the forms granted by this subclass, you can choose one of the following enhancements while in that form:

* **Critical Velocity.** You can hurl yourself at your enemies with high speed, impacting them for lethal damage. When you hit a target with a weapon attack, the lowest number you must roll on the d20 for it to be a critical hit is reduced by 1 for every 10 feet you move straight toward the target before the attack this turn. This cannot reduce the critical hit range below 16.
* **Crushing Impact.** Your hits are so forceful that creatures have trouble recovering. When you knock a creature prone using a shove or any of your Wild Shape abilities, it cannot stand up until the start of your next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so.

* **Elusive Movement.** You are as mercurial as the wind. Attacks of opportunity made against you have disadvantage. You also have resistance to damage from opportunity attacks, and they cannot grapple you on a hit.

#### Instincts of the Plains
*14th Level Circle of Tundra feature* <br>
You've honed your instincts to be alert to any danger. You gain proficiency in Dexterity saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Strength or Constitution saving throws (your choice). Additionally, you may add your Wisdom modifier to initiative rolls.

> ##### New Condition:  Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.
