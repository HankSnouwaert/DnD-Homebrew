## Martial Archetype

### Commander
A Commander on the field can be many things - a trusted
sergeant, a weary veteran, or merely someone with an
uncommon degree of common sense and a particularly keen
eye for how to win a fight.

A Commander can come from any background, but is
usually someone that has acquired their Wisdom the hard
way, having seen a bit of what life and battlefields have to
offer.

#### Form Up!
Starting when you chose this archetype at 3rd level, when you roll initiative and are not
surprised, any number of friendly creatures within 30 feet of
you can move up to a number of feet equal to five times your
Wisdom modifier (minimum 5 feet).

#### On Your Feet
Also starting at 3rd level, you can restore an ally's will to fight.  When you use your Second Wind feature, rather than restoring your own hit points, you can chose to target an allied creature within 5ft. of you.  When you heal an ally this way, add your Wisdom modifier to the amount healed.

When you use this feature to restore hit points to a creature at 0 hit points and the creature is prone, it can choose to stand immediately.

Additionally, you gain one extra use of Second Wind between short rests.

#### Keen Pointer
Starting at 7th level, when you make an attack action, you can replace any number of your weapon attacks with help actions.

#### Martial Surge
Starting at 10th level, you've learned to leverage fighting
alongside your allies. When you use your Action Surge, you may choose a number of creatures equal to your wisdom modifier within 30ft. of you that can hear you.  Those creatures can immediately make one weapon attack or cast a cantrip as reaction.

#### Bulwark
Starting at 15th level, when you and any number of friendly
creatures within 30 feet of you make a Saving Throw against
the same effect, you can expend a use of your Indomitable feature to allow anyone who failed the save to reroll their saving throw and use the new result.

#### No One Left Behind
Starting at 18th level, you can move up to your speed to get
within 5 feet of a creature you are targeting with your Second Wind as part of your Bonus Action. 

During this movement you gain resistance to all damage and have advantage on all saving throws.  The target may then use their reaction to move up to their move speed without provoking attacks of opportunity.
