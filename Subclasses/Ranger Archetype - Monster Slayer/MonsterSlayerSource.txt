## Ranger Archetype

### Monster Slayer
You have dedicated yourself to hunting down creatures of the night and wielders of grim magic. A monster slayer seeks out vampires, dragons, evil fey, fiends, and other magical threats. Trained in supernatural techniques to overcome such monsters, slayers are experts at unearthing and defeating mighty, mystical foes.

Monster slayers could have started out as lone hunters dedicating themselves to the hunt of supernatural evils out of personal interest, or they could serve as religious inquisitors, working to root out heresy in the name of their church. 

#### Hunter's Sense
*3rd-level Monster Slayer Feature*<br>
When you see a creature that is your Favored Enemy or marked by your *hunter's mark*, you automatically learn its creature type and the highest level spell slot it's capable of casting. Creatures immune to divination magic register as whatever creature type they wish to appear as, and as not being able to cast spells.

> ##### Which Ranger Version?
> This subclass is designed to easily work with all official 5e ranger variants.  
>
> **2014 Ranger.** This subclass's features work with both your Favored Enemy feature and any creature targeted by your *hunter's mark* spell. 
>
> **2024 Ranger.** Your Favored Enemy feature grants you additional uses of *hunter's mark*, so you can ignore references to the Favored Enemy feature.
>
> **Favored Foe Variant.** If you're playing a ranger variant with a Favored Foe feature, treat all references to Favored Enemy or creature marked by *hunter's mark* as though they only refer to your Favored Foe feature.

#### Punish The Wicked
*3rd-level Monster Slayer Feature*<br>
When a Favored Enemy or a creature marked by your *hunter's mark* you can see makes an attack roll against you or an ally you can see or forces you or an ally you can see to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to move up to half your speed toward or away from that Favored Foe without provoking opportunity attacks. You can then make one attack against that creature. 

This movement and attack are resolved before the roll is made for the triggering action.

#### Supernatural Defense  
*7th-level Monster Slayer Feature*<br>
Whenever you hit a creature with an attack triggered by your Punish Heresy feature, a triggering attack has 1d8 subtracted from it, and a triggering saving throw has 1d8 added to it.

#### Chastise The Unholy
*11th-level Monster Slayer Feature*<br>
When you hit a creature with an attack, you can force it to make a Wisdom save against your spell save DC. On a failure, it is turned by you for the next minute. While turned by you, the creature treats you as an object of its Fear (even if it is immune to the Fear condition), it can't cast spells other than cantrips, and it can't teleport. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### Condemn The Wicked
*15th-level Monster Slayer Feature*<br>
Any attack roll you make against a Favored Enemy or a creature marked by your *hunter's mark* is a critical hit on a roll of 18 - 20 on the d20.

Additionally, whenever you score a critical hit on a creature, you may use your Chastise the Unholy ability without expending a use of the feature. If the creature is already under the effects of your Chastise the Unholy ability, you may instead cause it to automatically fail the next saving throw it makes against your Chastise the Unholy feature.

## Alternative Favored Enemy Features
At your DM's discretion, you can add the following class features to the ranger from the 2014 or 2024 *Player's Handbook*. If a feature has the same name as an existing ranger feature, its effects replace those of the original feature; otherwise, it should be added as a new class feature. These features can be selected separately from one another; you can use some, all, or none of them.

If you take a feature that replaces another feature, you gain no benefit from the replaced one. If you take the Favored Foe feature, any other ranger features that interact with Favored Enemy do so with Favored Foe in the same way.
 
### Favored Foe
*1st-level ranger feature, which replaces the Favored Enemy feature*

When you hit a creature with an attack roll, you can call on a mystical bond to mark the target as your Favored Foe for 1 minute. Alternatively, you can use an action to mark a creature you can see within 120 feet as your Favored Foe.

When you hit a Favored Foe (including an attack you used to mark it) and deal damage, you can increase that damage by 1d4.

You can use this ability twice. You regain one expended use of the feature on a Short Rest, and all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th levels. 

At each level that you gain an additional use of this feature, the damage die increases to the next highest die (1d6 <br> at 5th, 1d8 at 9th, 1d10 at 13th, and 1d12 at 17th.)

\columnbreak

### Relentless Hunter
*13th-level ranger feature*

If you roll initiative and have no uses remaining of your Favored Foe feature, you regain a use. Additionally, Favored Foe now lasts up to 8 hours.

### Precise Hunter 
*17th-level ranger feature*

You have Advantage on attack rolls against your Favored Foes.

### Level 20: Foe Slayer
*20th-level ranger feature*

You now roll 2d12 for your Favored Foe feature.
