## Arcane Tradition

### School of Numerology
All wizards study the weave of magic, with <br> some focusing on specific schools of magic and <br> others on specialized applications.  Wizards who study <br> the school of numerology are less interested in these surface-level differentiations and instead study  the mathematical foundations of the magical weave itself.  These wizards seek to unlock the secrets of reality by studying and manipulating the arcane equations that describe the nature of magic.  By manipulating these equations, numerologists can perform magical feats, which allow them to enhance and optimize their magic to levels beyond the capabilities of their plebeian counterparts.

#### Solve the Equation
Beginning when you take this school at 2nd level, learn two Arcane Equations of your choice.  Arcane Equations are detailed at the end of this document and can be used to enhance your spells or provide you with other magical aid.  

All Arcane Equations require the use of a Magic Number.  A Magic Number is an arcane value that you keep within your mind for later use. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you can collect a Magic Number equal to the spell's level.  You can have a number of Magic Numbers equal to your Intelligence modifier at once, and they disappear if you complete a long rest. You can collect a total amount of Magic Numbers whose sum equals twice your wizard level and regain all uses of this feature when you complete a long rest.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace an Arcane Equation you know with a new one from the Arcane Equation list.

You learn an additional Arcane Equation of your choice at your 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th levels.

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>

 
#### Decisive Denial
At 6th level, you automatically learn *Dispel Magic* and *Counterspell*, and they are added to your spellbook.  If either spell is already in your spellbook, you can instead add another 3rd level spell from the wizard spell list.

Additionally, whenever you use *Dispel Magic* to end the effects of an ongoing spell, or you use *Counterspell* to prevent a spell from being cast, you can choose to collect a Magic Number whose value is equal to the spell level of the targeted spell or spell effect.

#### Biomathematician  
Starting at 10th level, whenever you roll a wizard hit die to regain hit points, you can change the die being rolled to a d4, d6, d8, d10, or d12.

Additionally, whenever you roll one or more hit die over the course of a short rest, you can combine the results of any number of those die into a final number, called a Short Rest Number, that can potentially be used to gain temporary hit points.  
If the Short Rest Number is equal to your wizard level, you gain temporary hit points equal to your wizard level + your Intelligence modifier.

If Short Rest Number is not equal to your wizard level, you may choose one of your Magic Numbers and add or subtract it from the Short Rest Number.  Doing this does not consume the Magic Number, and if it results in makomg the Short Rest Number equal to your wizard level, you can gain the temporary hit points this way.

#### Number Manipulation
Starting at 14th level, you may use a bonus action to split a Magic Number you’ve collected into any two Magic Numbers whose value adds up to the original’s value.  You cannot do this if it would cause you to exceed the maximum number of Magic Numbers you can hold at one time.

You may also choose to merge two Magic Numbers you’ve collected into a single Magic Number whose value equals the summation of the two Magic Numbers being merged.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier and regain all uses of it after completing a long rest.
  
#### Arcane Equations
The following Arcane Equation descriptions specify the effects of each equation and the circumstances under which it can be invoked.  Each description also includes the formula used to determine the magnitude of the effect.  The Magic Number used as an input in each equation is referenced by the letter ‘M.’  If an equation involves division, round all results down to the nearest whole number.<br>

##### Amplify Spell 
When casting a spell of first level or higher, you can use a Magic Number to increase the level at which it's cast.
