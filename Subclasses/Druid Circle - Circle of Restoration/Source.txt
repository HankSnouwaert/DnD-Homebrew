## Druid Circle

### Circle of Restoration
The many gifts provided by nature must sometimes be reciprocated. Restoration druids seek order in the world by tending directly to its many life forms. Friend to flora and fauna alike, these druids celebrate birth and growth. Where there is decay, they bring rejuvenation. Where there is abatement, they summon regrowth. Life not only needs protection, it needs nourishment.



#### Restoration Spells
Your connection to nature's healing powers infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Protection from Evil and Good, Shield of Faith |
|  3rd          | Barkskin, Dragon's Breath |
|  5th          | Haste,  Protection from Energy      | 
|  7th          | Death Ward, Stoneskin     |
|  9th          | Skill Empowerment*, Tranquility*  |

At 6th level, you may learn an additional spell from the following list: *Sanctuary, Enhance Ability, Enlarge/Reduce, Protection from Poison, Spider Climb, Warding Bond* 

At 10th level, you may choose another spell from this list, and you automatically learn *Freedom of Movement*.

At 14th level, you may choose another spell from this list, and you automatically learn *Regenerate*.

#### Nature's Gift
You don't keep nature's bounty to yourself, but seek to share it with others.  Starting at 2nd level, you may use a bonus action to expend a use of your wild shape feature and enter a state of unity with the natural world for 10 minutes.  While in this state, you may cast spells from your Restoration Spell list without expending a spell slot.  Spells cast in this state don't require concentration to maintain. You may not cast spells at a higher level than you are normally able to cast.  

You can cast a number of spells this way that have a total combined spell level equal to your druid level divided by 3 (rounded up), after which point this state ends.  

Starting at 6th level, when you enter this state, you may expend two uses of your Wild Shape feature to double the total combined spell level worth of spells you can cast.

#### Natural Harmony

At 6th level, you can draw vitality from the web of life that connects you to your allies.  Every time one of your druid spells heals a creature, it heals that creature for an additional 1d6 health for every other creature under the effect of one of your Restoration Spells, up to a maximum of 3d6 health. 

Additionally, whenever you hit a creature with a druid spell attack or a creature fails its saving throw against one of your druid spells, all creatures under the effect of one of your Restoration Spells are healed for a number of hit points equal to 3 times the level of the spell cast (no effect for cantrips).

#### Rejuvenation
At 10th level, you may use your bonus action to infuse a creature within 30 feet of you with restorative energies.  At the start of each of that creature's turns, it heals a number of hit points equal to your proficiency modifier.  This effect lasts for 3 rounds or until you use this ability again.  

Creatures under the effect of this ability are treated as though they are being effected and healed by one of your Restoration Spells for the purposes of your Natural Harmony feature.

You may use this ability a number of times equal to half your druid level rounded up, and regain all uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Flow of Life

At 14th level, when a creature starts its turn while under the effects of your Rejuvenation feature or one of your Restoration Spells, you or it may chose to end that effect early and cure the creature of any blinded, deafened, paralyzed, or poisoned conditions effecting it.  

Additionally, when a creature ends its turn under the effects of your Rejuvenation feature or one of your Restoration Spells, you or it may chose to pass the effect to another creature within 30 feet of it.  The remaining duration for the effect carries over the new creature.
