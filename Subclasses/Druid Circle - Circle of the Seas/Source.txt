## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Seas
DRUIDS!

#### Sea Forms
 The rites of your circle grant you the ability to transform into more dangerous sea animal forms. Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Wild Shape to transform into a beast with a challenge rating as high as 1. You ignore the Max. CR column of the Beast Shapes table, but must abide by the other limitations there.

However, the creature must have a swim speed but no land speed, or the ability to breath underwater.

Starting at 6th level, you can transform into a beast that meets these criteria with a challenge rating as high as your druid level divided by 3, rounded down.

#### Seas Spells
Your mystical connection to the seas infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 



| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *Create or Destroy Water*, Ensnaring Strike, *Fog Cloud*  |
|  3rd          | *Blur*, *Misty Step*, Hold Person  |
|  5th          | *Tidal Wave*, Wall of Water, *Water Breathing*, Water Walk     | 
|  7th          | *Control Water*, Dimension Door, Evard's Black Tentacles, *Watery Sphere*     |
|  9th          | *Far Step*, Hold Monster, *Maelstrom*     |

#### Sea Dweller
At 2nd level, when you wild shape into a Sea Form, you can create a mass of 10-foot deep water with a 10-foot radius centered on you.  The water lasts until you are no longer in a Sea Form.  On subsequent turns, you can use your action or bonus to recreate the area of water centered on yourself, causing the old area to dissipate.  

Starting at 6th level, you can extend the radius of the water out to 15 feet.  At 12th level, you can extend it out to 20 feet. And at 16th level, you can extend it out to 25 feet.

#### Primal Weapons
At 6th level, if you have magic weapon merge into any of your wild shapes, your attacks in wild shape form count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.


#### Terrian Feature
Starting at 6th level, while you are in an area of water at least 5 feet deep, you may use a bonus action to dive down and use your swim speed to teleport to another body of water you can see that is at least 5 feet deep and large enough to contain you.  Diving down this way provokes opportunity attacks, and you can only teleport to a body of water you could reach via water with any remaining swim speed you have.

If your Sea Dweller feature is active, you may center it on any point you could reach and use it as your target body of water when you use this feature.

You may take a Dash, Disengage, or Hide action as part of your bonus action made to use this feature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your your Proficiency Modifier and can't do so again until you complete a long rest or expend a spell slot of 2nd level or higher.

#### Avatar of the Seas
Starting at 10th level, you can expend two uses of Wild Shape as a bonus action to transform into a Sea Form with a CR equal to half your druid level, rounded down.

#### Final Ability
 Starting at 14th level, transform into sea monsters
