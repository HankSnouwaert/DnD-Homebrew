## Roguish Archetype

### Deadeye
You've dedicated yourself to becoming an expert sharpshooter.  Unlike other marksman who fire volleys of arrows at their enemies, you can accomplish everything you need with a single well aimed shot.  Capable of performing almost superhuman feats with their tactical shots, deadeyes are greatly feared for their ability to disable and dispatch unsuspecting foes from afar.

#### Bonus Proficiencies
Starting  at 3rd level, you gain proficiency will all bows and crossbows as well as the Perception skill.  If you are already proficient in Perception, you gain expertise in this skill.

#### Tactical Shooter
Starting at 3rd level, you learn how to execute special trick shots beyond the scope of any ordinary marksman.  Whenever you land a Sneak Attack on a creature with a ranged weapon, you can use one or more Trick Shots (listed at the end of the document) before rolling for damage.  To do so, you must forgo rolling a certain number of Sneak Attack dice based on the Trick Shots used, after which the damage from any remaining sneak attack dice is applied.

When you execute a Trick Shot, it must target the creature you hit with the sneak attack, unless its description states otherwise.  

You can only use a Trick Shot if its cost in Sneak Attack dice does not exceed the amount of Sneak Attack dice you can normally roll with an attack.  For example, *Blinding Shot* requires you to sacrifice 4d6 Sneak Attack dice to use, meaning you can't use it until 7th level, when your number of Sneak Attack dice increases to 4d6.

If you use a Trick Shot when you score a critical hit, double the amount of Sneak Attack dice to be rolled for damage, then subtract the costs of the Trick Shots being used from this total.

If your Trick Shots require a saving throw, the DC is calculated as follows:

<div style='margin-top:20px'></div>
 
 <font face='scalysans' size='2'>
 
 <center> 
 
 **Trick Shot Save DC** </font> = <font face='scalysans' size='2'> 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier
 
 </center>
 
 </font>

If a creature would be subjected to multiple shots requiring saving throws, it makes a single save against all the effects.

#### Open Targets
Starting at 9th level, whenever you make a sneak attack with a ranged weapon against a creature that doesn't have any cover from you and is not obscured from you in any way, the sneak attack gains 2d6 additional sneak attack die.

At 14th level the additional sneak attack die increases to 3d6, and at 19th level it increases to 4d6.

#### Hidden Sniper
Starting at 13th level, ranged attacks made while hidden no longer reveal your position.

#### Ricochet Arrows

Also at 13th level, when you make a ranged weapon attack, you may chose to target a solid surface within your weapon's range to bounce the arrow off of.  When you do so, you may make the weapon attack against a creature from the direction of the ricochet.  
The total distance your arrow travels cannot exceed your weapons range, and disadvantage is applied to attacks that exceed its short range, as usual. The ricochet attack is also made with disadvantage if you cannot see the target creature.

At 18th level, you can make two ricochets as part of the same attack.

> ##### Impossible Angles
> When making a ricochet shot, you can generally assume you are making the weapon attack as though you are firing from the location of the ricochet.  However, the DM may rule that some angles of attack are impossible if they would require the arrow to fly in an unnatural direction.


#### Death From Afar
Starting at 17th level, any hit you score with a ranged weapon against a creature that is surprised is a critical hit.  Additionally, creatures that haven't taken their turn yet have disadvantage on saving throws against your Trick Shots.

#### Trick Shots
The following Trick Shots can be applied whenever you would apply sneak attack damage to a creature.  Each Trick Shot costs a certain amount of sneak attack die to use, which is deducted from the sneak attack damage applied to the target. If the creature would be subjected to multiple Trick Shots from a single attack that require saving throws, these saving throws are all made separately.  


***Knock Back Shot.*** (Costs 2d6)
You strike the target's center mass, forcing it to succeed a Strength saving throw or be knocked 5ft. away from the direction from which it was hit.

***Piercing Shot.*** (Costs 2d6 per creature pierced)
You cause your shot to pierce through multiple creatures.  When you pierce a creature, you may make another weapon attack against a creature directly behind it that is within your weapon's range.  You may do this multiple times, and must forgo 2d6 sneak attack die per creature pierced.  If you apply any other Trick Shots to this attack, you may choose which creature struck you apply any given Trick Shot to, so long as that creature would be a viable target for a sneak attack.

***Slowing Shot.*** (Costs 2d6)
You attempt to shoot the creature in a way to impede its movement, such as by hamstringing it.  The creature must make a Constitution saving throw or have its move speed halved until the beginning of your next turn.

***Disarming Shot.*** (Costs 3d6)
You attempt to knock an object being held by the target out of its grasp.  The target must succeed a Strength saving throw or drop a single item of your choice that it is holding.

***Tripping Shot.*** (Costs 3d6)
You attempt to trip and knock your target prone with your shot.  The target must make a Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.


<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br> 

***Pinning Shot.*** (Costs 4d6)
You attempt to pin your target to the ground or any other hard surface it is standing near.  The target must succeed a Strength saving throw or have its move speed reduced to 0 as it becomes pinned by your arrow to its current location.  The target or any creature within 5ft. of it can use an action to remove the arrow, ending the effect.  Once you've attempted this Trick Shot against a creature, you can't make any other attack rolls as part of this attack.

***Bleeding Shot.*** (Costs 4d6)
You strike the target in a vulnerable location, causing it to begin bleeding out.  While it is bleeding, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of your turns.  A creature must have blood or something equivalent to suffer from this effect, and can only suffer one instance of this effect at a time. 

Regaining any number of hit points ends the wound. Alternatively, the target creature or anyone within 5ft. of it may use an action to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your Trick Shot save DC to end to end the effect.

***Blinding Shot.*** (Costs 5d6)
You attempt to shoot the creature in the eyes, to temporarily blind it.  The target must make a Dexterity saving throw or become blinded until the beginning of your next turn.  

***Concussive Shot.*** (Costs 7d6)
You attempt to concuss the creature, temporarily stunning it.  The target must make a Constitution saving throw or become stunned until the beginning of your next turn.
