## Druid Circle

### Circle of Spores (Alternative)
Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.

Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.

#### Circle Spells
Your symbiotic link to fungi and your ability to tap into the cycle of life and death grant you access to certain spells.
At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Spores Spells table. Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.


| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Chill Touch |
|  3rd          | Blindess/Deafness, Gentle Repose |
|  5th          | Animate Dead, Gaseous Form      | 
|  7th          | Blight, Confusion     |
|  9th          | Cloudkill, Contagion    |

#### Halo of Spores
Starting at 2nd level, you are surrounded by invisible, necrotic spores that are harmless until you unleash them on a creature nearby. When a creature you can see moves into a space within 10 feet of you or starts its turn there, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 necrotic damage to that creature unless it succeeds on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The necrotic damage increases to 1d6 at 6th level, 1d8 at 10th level, and 1d10 at 14th level.

#### Symbiotic Entity
At 2nd level, you also gain the ability to channel magic into your spores. As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to awaken those spores, rather than transforming into a beast form, and you gain temporary hit points equal to 4 + four times your druid level, and you may choose one of the following damage types: radiant, psychic, acid, poison or necrotic.

While this feature is active:

- Your melee weapon attacks deal extra damage of the chosen type equal to one roll of your Halo of Spores dice.

- Your Halo of Spores damage type changes to the chosen damage type

- When you deal your Halo of Spores damage, roll the damage die a second time and add it to the total.

These benefits last for one hour, until you lose all these temporary hit points, or until you use your Wild Shape again.


#### Fungal Infestation
At 6th level, your spores gain the ability to infest a corpse and spawn new life. Once per round, if a creature that you can see that is small or larger within 10 feet of you dies, you can cause a Sporeling to immediately grow out of it's corpse (no action required).  The Sporeling is friendly to you and your companions, it obeys your mental commands, and remains animated for 1 hour, after which time it explodes in a burst of spores.  See this creature's game statistics in the Sporeling stat block at the end of the document.

In combat, the Sporeling shares your <br> initiative count, but it takes its turn <br> immediately after yours. The only action <Br> it takes on its turn is the Attack action, making <br> one melee attack, unless you take a bonus action <br> on your turn to command it to take another action. <br> That action can be one in its stat block or some <br> other action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Fungal Body

At 14th level, the fungal spores in your body alter you: you can't be blinded, deafened, frightened, or poisoned, and any critical hit against you counts as a normal hit instead, unless you're incapacitated.
