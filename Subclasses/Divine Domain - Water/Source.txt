### Aquatic
Gods of destruction wish one thing of their followers: to bring about devastation wherever they tread. Gods of this domain include Shiva, Kali, Set, Tiamat, Gruumsh, The Devourer, and The Fury. Clerics of these gods are not only masters of destruction, but they also bring forth the full destructive potential of their allies. Woe be to any that stand in their path.

#### Initiate of Water
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
You learn the *control water* cantrip. It counts as cleric cantrip for you, but doesâ€™t count against your number of cantrips known.  Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your move speed.  If you already have a swim speed, it is increased by 10 feet.

#### Ebb and Flow
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
The sea both giveth and taketh away.  The depth of your sacred connection to this domain is represented by a pool of d4s.  This pool grows like the tides as your divine powers ebb and flow between the destructive and restorative aspects of the sea.  At any given time, you are in one of two states: Ebb or Flow.  You can choose which state you are in when you gain this feature and whenever you complete a short or long rest.  Otherwise, you can enter each of these states under the following conditions:

**Ebb:** Whenever you cast one of your Aquatic Domain spells.

**Flow:** Whenever you cast a cleric spell of first level or higher level that restores hit points to a creature or cures it of a negative status condition.

Whenever you switch states, add a d4 to your dice pool.  If you end your turn without having switched states this turn, empty the dice pool.

While you have dice in this pool, whenever you cast a Cleric spell of first level or higher that deals damage or restores hit points, roll all the dice in your pool and add the result to any healing or damage done to a single creature of your choice affected by the spell.  Doing this does not empty the dice pool.

#### Channel Divinity: Watery Domain
*2nd level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>

As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to switch to either the Ebb or Flow state while also calling forth the waters of your god's domain at a point you can see within 60 feet of you.  The summoned waters take the shape of a circular body of 10-foot deep water with a radius of 10 feet.  Alternatively, you can target an existing cylindrical area of water you can see with a radius of up to 20 feet and a depth of up to 20 feet to bring under the control of your god.  

This domain lasts for 1 minute, and the effect ends early if you are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you switch between the Ebb and Flow states while this effect is active, you can cause waves to erupt outwards from the center of the water.  Each creature in the body of water, or within 10 feet of it, must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail.  On a failure, the creature is either healed for or takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of all the d4s in your pool (your choice.)  All creatures who failed their save are then pulled towards or pushed away from the center of the water (your choice) by 5 feet for every d4 you rolled.   The watery domain's radius then increases by 10 feet. 



#### Rising Tide
*6th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>

Whenever you cast a spell of first level or higher, if it is a higher level than any spells you've cast since the beginning of your last turn, you add a d4 to your Ebb and Flow dice pool.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Banished to the Deep 
*17th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>

If your Watery Domain feature is active, you may use an action to expend all the dice in your Ebb and Flow pool and roll them.  Each creature of your choice in the Watery Domain must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to the result you rolled from your Ebb and Flow dice pool.  On a failure, the creature is pulled deep into the water and subjected to the plane shift spell, with the destination being your diety's home plane.  If no such plane exists, you can instead target a watery plane.  If a creature passes, you may instead have it pushed or pulled 5 feet away or towards the center of the domain for every Ebb and Flow die rolled.

### Bog Domain

#### Channel Divinity: Watery Domain
*2nd level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>

As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to switch to either the Ebb or Flow state while also calling forth the waters of your god's domain at a point you can see within 60 feet of you.  The summoned waters take the shape of a circular body of muddy 5-foot deep water with a radius of 20 feet.  Alternatively, you can target an existing cylindrical area of water you can see with a radius of up to 30 feet that is no deeper than 10 feet to bring under the control of your god.  

This domain lasts for 1 minute, and the effect ends early if you are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you switch between the Ebb and Flow states while this effect is active, you can cause the domain's radius to increase by 5 feet.  Each creature in the domain must then make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail.  On a failure, the creature is either healed for or takes necrotic damage equal to a roll of all the d4s in your pool (your choice.)  Creatures who took damage from this effect have their speed reduced by 5 feet for every d4 you rolled and are pulled to the bottom of the watery domain by gripping mud.  This effect lasts until the creature uses an action to free itself from the muddy restraints or leaves the body of water. 

### River Domain
#### Channel Divinity: Watery Domain
*2nd level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to switch to either the Ebb or Flow state while also calling forth the waters of your god's domain at a point you can see within 60 feet of you.  The summoned waters take the shape of two 10 ft. deep by 10 ft. wide by 20ft. long stretches of water that must be contiguous with each other.  Alternatively, you may choose an existing contiguous area of water you can see that is up to 50 ft. long and 20 ft. deep to bring under the control of your god.  

When you create this domain, choose the direction it is flowing in.  Traveling against this current uses twice as much movement, and traveling with it uses half as much.  

This domain lasts for 1 minute, and the effect ends early if you are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you switch between the Ebb and Flow states while this effect is active, you can extend the river's length while causing the water to violently flow in the direction of your choice.  The river's length increases by 10 feet, and this extra length extends outwards from either end of the water in the direction of your choice.  Each creature in the body of water must then make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail.  On a failure, the creature is pulled downstream by 5 ft. for each d4 in your Ebb and Flow pool.  For every 5 ft. it is pulled, it either takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage or is healed for 2d4 hit points (your choice.)
