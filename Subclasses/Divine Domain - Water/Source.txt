### Aquatic
Gods of destruction wish one thing of their followers: to bring about devastation wherever they tread. Gods of this domain include Shiva, Kali, Set, Tiamat, Gruumsh, The Devourer, and The Fury. Clerics of these gods are not only masters of destruction, but they also bring forth the full destructive potential of their allies. Woe be to any that stand in their path.

#### Initiate of Water
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
You learn the *control water* cantrip. It counts as cleric cantrip for you, but doesâ€™t count against your number of cantrips known.  Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your move speed.  If you already have a swim speed, it is increased by 10 feet.

#### Summon Waters
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
When you chose the subclass, choose what type of watery domain your god preside over: ocean, river, or swamp.  As a bonus action, you can call forth waters from your god's domain at a point on the ground you can see within 60 feet of you.  The form this water takes depends on the watery domain of your god.  Regardless of its form, the water may flow uphill, over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and regain all uses when you complete a long rest.

##### Ocean
It is a circular body of 10 foot deep water with a radius of 20 feet.  Alternatively, you can target an existing cylindrical area of water you can see with a radius of up to 30 feet and a depth of up to 20 feet.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause waves to erupt outwards from the center of the water.  Each creature in the body of water or within 10 feet of it, must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failure, it takes X bludgeoning damage and is pulled 10 feet towards the center of the water.  On a success, it takes half as much damage and is not pulled.  You can allow any number of creatures you can see to automatically pass the saving throw.

##### River
It is composed of two 10ft. deep by 10ft. wide by 20ft. long stretches of water that must be contiguous with each other.  Alternatively, you may choose an existing contiguous area of water you can see up to 50 feet long and 20 feet deep. 

When you summon the water, choose the direction it is flowing in.  Traveling against this current uses twice as much movement, and traveling with it uses half as much.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the water violently flow in the direction of your choice.  Each creature in the body of water must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failure, it takes X bludgeoning damage.  If you aren't changing the current's direction, the creature is also pulled 20 feet in the water's current direction; otherwise, it's pulled 10 feet.  On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pulled downstream.  You can allow any number of creatures you can see to automatically pass the saving throw.  


##### Swamp
It is a circular body of muddy 5 foot deep water with a radius of 20 feet.  Alternatively, you can target an existing cylindrical area of water you can see with a radius of up to 30 feet that is no deeper than 10 feet.

As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can cause the mud to grasp at the water's inhabitants as it attempts to suck the life out of them.  Each creature in the body of water must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failure, it takes X necrotic damage, is pulled to the bottom of the water, and has its movement speed reduced by 10 feet.  The speed reduction lasts until it uses an action to free itself for the muddy restraints or leaves the body of water.  On a success, it takes half as much damage and does not have its speed reduced.  You can allow any number of creatures you can see to automatically pass the saving throw.

#### Channel Divinity: Watery Judgement
*2nd level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
As an action, you may use your Channel Divinity to target a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier that you can see in bodies of water at least 5 feet deep and subject them to your deity's judgment.

Allied creatures are healed a number of hit points equal to X.

Enemy creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failure, they suffer a level of exhaustion. 

#### Aquatic Reach
*6th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
You may now extend the reach of the watery domains you control using your Summon Waters feature.  Whenever you use your bonus action to activate the effects of the body of your Summon Waters feature, it now has the following additional effects.

##### Ocean
The water's radius increases by 5 feet.  Creatures who were already in the body of water and failed the saving throw against the Summon Water's effect take an additional X bludgeoning damage.

##### River
The body of water's length increases by 10 feet.  This extra length extends outwards from either end of the water in the direction of your choice.  Creatures who were already in the body of water and failed the saving throw against the Summon Water's effect are pulled twice as far in the chosen direction.

##### Swamp
The body of water's radius increases by 5 feet.   Creatures who currently have their movement speed reduced by the body of water and who failed their saving throw against the Summon Water's effect are restrained.  This condition ends when the creature or anyone within 5 feet of it uses an action to pull it free.

#### Potent Spellcasting
Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Banished to the Deep
*17th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
Using the water you control with your Summon Waters feature, you can now banish a victim to your god's watery domain.  The conditions under which you can do this depend on the type of water you control.

**Ocean.**
The body of water has a radius of at least 30 feet, and a creature that is within 10 feet of the water's center fails its saving throw against your Summon Waters feature

**River.**
A creature is pulled a total of 30 feet at once along your river by your Summon Waters feature

**Swamp.**
A creature restrained by your waters fails its saving your against your Summon Waters feature

If any of these conditions are met, you can use your reaction to force the specified creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failure, the creature is pulled deep into the water and subjected to the plane shift spell, with the destination being your diety's home plane.  If no such plane exists, you can instead target a watery plane, such as the Elemental Plane of Water.

Once you successfully use this feature against a creature, you can't do so again until you complete a long rest.
