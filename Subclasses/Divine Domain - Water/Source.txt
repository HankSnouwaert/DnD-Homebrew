### Aquatic
Gods of destruction wish one thing of their followers: to bring about devastation wherever they tread. Gods of this domain include Shiva, Kali, Set, Tiamat, Gruumsh, The Devourer, and The Fury. Clerics of these gods are not only masters of destruction, but they also bring forth the full destructive potential of their allies. Woe be to any that stand in their path.

#### Initiate of Water
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
You learn the *control water* cantrip. It counts as cleric cantrip for you, but doesâ€™t count against your number of cantrips known.  Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your move speed.  If you already have a swim speed, it is increased by 10 feet.

#### Ebb and Flow
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
The sea both giveth and taketh away.  The depth of your sacred connection to this domain is represented by a pool of d4s.  This pool grows like the tides as your divine powers ebb and flow between the destructive and restorative aspects of the sea.  At any given time, you are in one of two states: Ebb or Flow.  You can choose which state you are in when you gain this feature and whenever you complete a short or long rest.  Otherwise, you can enter each of these states under the following conditions:

**Ebb:** Whenever you cast one of your Aquatic Domain spells.

**Flow:** Whenever you cast a cleric spell of first level or higher level that restores hit points to a creature or cures it of a negative status condition.

Whenever you switch states, add a d4 to your dice pool.  If you end your turn without having switched states this turn, empty the dice pool.

While you have dice in this pool, whenever you cast a Cleric spell of first level or higher that deals damage or restores hit points, roll all the dice in your pool and add the result to any healing or damage done to a single creature of your choice affected by the spell.  Doing this does not empty the dice pool.

#### Channel Divinity: Raging Current
*2nd level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>

As a Bonus Action you switch to either Ebb or Flow state, you then may case water filled a 10 foot radius with in 30 of you. The sphere lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or die or use this feature again.

Whenever you switch states after this while the sphere is active, increase the radius by 10 feet and have each creature in the radius repeat the saving throw, each creature in the area must succeed on a strength saving throw (the target can choose to fail) and roll all the dice in your pool, for each target that failed save you can either have it take bludgeoning damage or heals equal to the result and you may have it be pushed or pulled number feet away or towards the center of the sphere equal to the result

#### Crashing Waves
*6th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>

Whenever you cast a spell of first or higher level, if you have not cast spell that is a higher level then that spell since your last turn. You add dice to your pool

#### 
*17th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>

As a Action, you may end your Raging Current and expend all the dice in your pool and roll them, each creature of your choice in the Raging Current when it ends must make a Strength saving throw against the result your rolled. On a failure, the creature is pulled deep into the water and subjected to the plane shift spell, with the destination being your diety's home plane. If no such plane exists, you can instead target a watery plane, if it passes, you may have it be pushed or pulled number feet away or towards the center of the sphere equal to the result instead.
