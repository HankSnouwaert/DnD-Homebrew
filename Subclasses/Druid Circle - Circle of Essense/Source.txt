## Druid Circle

### Circle of Essense
Druids of this circle draw their magic from the energy that endlessly flows from life to death, and back again. They see the duality of thriving life and inevitable death in all things, tapping and manipulating the transition of energy between these states. Some essence druids focus on channeling vital energies to nurture life and empower others, while others embrace the drain of vitality into decay to sap and strike down their foes.

#### Circle Spells
When you join this circle at 2nd level, you have a understanding of the a bond between life and death  it ever flowing cycle. Your link with this cycle grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Witherbloom Spells table.
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

#### Essence Tap
At 2nd level, you can draw on a reservoir of life to empower you spells, As an action, you can expend a use of your wild shape feature to to create an essence mote, rather than transforming into a beast. You can summon a death mote or a life mote. You can apply the mote to a druid spell you cast of 1st level or higher. You can only apply a mote once per casting of a spell.
Life motes and death motes modify the spell they are applied to in the following ways:

**Death mote.** When the spell deals damage to a creature, you may have that creature take additional necrotic damage equal to 3 times the spell's level. The death mote then becomes a life mote.

**Life Mote.** When the spell restores a creature's hit points, you may have that creature regain additional hit points equal to equal to 3 times the spell's level. The life mote then becomes a death mote.

The mote lasts 1 hour.  It ends early if you dismiss it (no action required), or use this feature again, or die.

#### Essence Pulse
Beginning at 6th level, you gain an even greater ability to enhance the spells infused with your motes. When you cast a mote enhanced spell, it gains the following additional effects:

**Death mote.** When the spell deals damage, you can change the damage type to necrotic, and it ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

**Life Mote.** When the spell restores hit points to a creature other than you, you gain temporary hit points equal to 3 times the spell's level.

#### Culling Ritual
Beginning at 10th level, when a creature reaches the thin line between life or death, you can determine it's fate. When creature within 60 feet of you drops to 0 hit points, you may choose to to apply one of the following effects to it as a reaction:

**Cull** The creature is disintegrated and reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. A disintegrated creature leaves behind everything it is wearing and carrying. The creature can be restored to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

**Invigorate**  The creature regains a number of hit points equal to 2d4 + your Wisdom modifier.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.  While you have no uses available, you can consume a death mote to use the cull feature or life mote to use the invigorate feature.

#### Withering Vortex

At 14th level, you can transfer the life force of creatures with your magic. When you apply your mote to a druid spell that is 5th level or lower, you may add an additional effect to the spell based on the mote used:

**Death Mote** - If the spell deals necrotic damage to any creatures, choose one of the creatures that took this damage. You drain an amount of life energy equal to half the necrotic damage dealt to the chosen creature. One creature other than yourself that you can see within 30 feet of you regains a number of hit points equal to the life energy drained.

**Life Mote** - If the spell heals any creatures, choose one of the creatures that had its hit points restored. You may force a creature within 30 feet of it make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. The creature takes necrotic damage equal to the amount healed on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can use each of these features three times, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
