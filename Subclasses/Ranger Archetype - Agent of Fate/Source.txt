## Ranger Archetype

### Agent of Fate
Some see death as a force of nature, but it has its <br> own agents that act on its behalf. The rangers of <br> this  conclave are said to be able to see those who <br> have been chosen by death and bring their fate to <br> fruition. Some of these agents spend their lives training <br> to see the strings of fate that predict oneâ€™s death, believing they are helping right the wrongs that mortals and other fiends have used to try to subvert fate. Others of these conclaves seem to believe it is destiny, having at some point in their life begun to see the delicate strings that connect all life and also these strings needs to be cut. It is unclear whether this change in perspective was caused by a near-death experience or initiated by some god of death; all that is known is that when death marks its quarry, its hunters will find them.

> ##### What Ranger Version?
> This Subclass assumes you are using the Favored Foe feature from *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything*


#### Agent of Fate Magic
Starting at 3rd level, you learn one or more additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Agent of Fate Spells table.  These spells count as a ranger spell for you, but they don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

##### Agent of Fate Spells
| Ranger  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  3rd          | Detect Evil and Good  |
|  5th          | Augury  |
|  9th          |   Clairvoyance    | 
|  13th         |   Divination     |
|  17th         |   Scrying   |

#### Marked for Death
At 3rd level your Favored Foe feature becomes even more potent, as it becomes an omen of death. It gains the following benefits.
- You gain additional number of uses of Favored Foe each day equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one additional use).
- Any attack roll you make against the Favored Foe is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20
- When you hit the Favored Foe, you may have your Favored Foe feature deal to additional two dice damage to the creature.  If you do the creature is no longer marked.

#### Fate's Quarry
Starting at 7th level, you ensure no quarry escapes fate. When you cast a divination spell of first level or higher, you may have the casting time of the spell become 10 seconds. 

If you do, for the duration of the spell, you may choose one creature targeted with the spell, a creature that you mentioned in a question for the spell, or a creature you sensed with the spell. You then gain an extra use of Favored Foe that you may only use on that creature. You can only gain one extra use of Favored Foe per casting of a spell. 

Once you use this feature again, you lose all other uses of Favored Foe you gained from this feature.


#### Death Knell
At 11th level, your mark echoes out to other creatures.  You learn the *Toll the Dead* cantrip if you don't already know it and it counts as ranger spells for you.

Additionally, when your Favored Foe is reduced to 0 hit points or you remove the mark using your Marked for Death feature, you may use your reaction to cast *Toll the Dead* on another creature within range. You may also choose to transfer over your Favored Foe to the creature you cast *Toll the Dead* on.

You can use this feature once per use of Favored Foe.


#### Peirce the Veil
At 15th level, you can perceive the threads of fate as easily as you can see the material world. When you cast a divination spell, you can cast it without any somatic, verbal or material components.

You also gain true sight out to 60 feet.
