## Druid Circle

### Circle of The Tundra
Most druids of this circle make their homes in the coldest environments their world has to offer, and they have adapted all aspects of their druidic abilities to reflect this harsh environment.  They practice shapeshifting into arctic creatures while channeling the brutal nature of their boreal homes to unleash icy magics upon their enemies and can even summon and control enchanted glaciers with which to smite their foes.

#### Tundra Spells
*2nd Level Circle of the Tundra Feature*<br>
Your mystical connection to the arctic infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells.  Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.  If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.  

##### Circle of The Tundra Spells

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *armor of agathys*, *ice knife* |
|  3rd          | *ice sheet**, *frost nova** |
|  5th          | *sleet storm*, *winter's kiss**   | 
|  7th          | *fire shield*(cold shield only), *ice storm** |
|  9th          | *cone of cold*, *icy tomb** |

#### Tundra Forms
*2nd Level Circle of The Tundra Feature* <br>
You can now use your Wild Shape feature to transform into unique arctic animal forms granted by this subclass, and when using your Wild Shape this way, you may use it as a bonus action. Detailed descriptions of these forms can be found in the Tundra Wild Shapes section.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


When shapeshifting into these forms, you can choose to either be Small or Medium. Starting at 10th level, you can also choose to be Large. 

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Tundra Spells list and ignore their material component requirements.

You start knowing three of these forms: Elk, Wolf, and Wolverine. Additional wild shape forms from this subclass become available at levels 4 and 8. (In the case of the Elephant and Rhino forms, you become wooly versions of these creatures.)

##### Tundra Wild Shape Options
| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Elk, Wolf, Wolverine |
|  4th          | Bear, Leopard Seal, Lynx | 
|  8th          | Elephant, Rhino|

#### Boreal Dweller
*2nd Level Circle of The Tundra Feature*<br>
You gain resistance to cold damage. If you already have resistance to cold damage from a racial feature, you instead gain advantage on Constitution saving throws against effects that would deal cold damage to you. Your movement is also unaffected by difficult terrain made of ice or snow, and such terrain can't cause you to fall prone.

Additionally, you gain an advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) checks relating to tundra environments and the life that inhabits them. You can also speak with animals who dwell in tundra environments as though under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made while interacting with them.

\pagebreakNum



#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of The Tundra feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Glacial Summoning
*6th Level Circle of The Tundra Feature*<br>
You've gained the ability to call forth icy manifestations of your boreal homelands.  You may use your action to summon a glacial mass of ice, causing it to burst from a location on the ground or on top of a liquid surface that you can see within 20 feet.  The ice can be up to 10 feet long on any side, and it must be summoned in an unoccupied space large enough to contain it.

The ice has an AC 14 and hit points equal to five times your druid level.  It is immune to poison, psychic, cold damage, and vulnerable to fire, thunder and bludgeoning damage.  If reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles to mist.

The ice emanates a 10-foot aura of cold, and creatures other than you treat the space in this aura as difficult terrain.

As a bonus action, you can move the ice up to 20 feet along any solid or liquid surface.  If you move the ice into a creature, that creature must make the Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.  The creature takes 3d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

Once you summon the glacial, you cannot summon one again until you complete a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher.

\columnbreak

#### Avatar of The Tundra
*10th Level Circle of Tundra feature* <br>
When you use your Wild Shape feature to transform into one of the forms granted by this subclass, you can choose one of the following enhancements while in that form:

* **Aurora Form.** Your form is infused with the shimmering lights of the polar night sky, causing you to glow with a dancing green radiance. You emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Additionally, you have a fly speed equal to your form's walking speed.

* **Primordial Form.** Your form grows to the immense size of ancient megafauna. Your size becomes Huge in your new form, and your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage. Additionally, you get a +2 bonus to Strength saving throws and the spell save DC for any abilities your wild shape has.

* **Wendigo Form.** Your form becomes emaciated and sinuous as you hunger for the warmth of life. When you hit a non-undead, non-construct creature with a melee attack granted by your wild shape, you regain hit points equal to half the amount of damage dealt.


#### Frozen Assault
*14th Level Circle of The Tundra Feature*<br>
You can now channel the remorseless fury of the north through your attacks. Whenever you would deal bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage with a melee weapon attack, you may change the damage type to cold.
 
Additionally, whenever you deal cold damage to a creature or a creature starts its turn in an area of difficult terrain composed of ice or snow created by one of your druid spells or features, you may reduce its speed by 10 feet until the end of your next turn. This speed reduction can't stack multiple times on a single creature.

___

A wave of cold 30 feet long and 15 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. The ground in the area is covered with ice, turning it into difficult terrain for the duration. Any surface of a body of water or a liquid that is principally water-based within the area freezes to a depth of 6 inches for the duration. Creatures may move across the frozen surfaces as if they are difficult terrain. 

**Destroying The Ice.** A 5-foot square area of ice can be destroyed by attacking it (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). 

**Slipping On The Ice.** When the ice appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. 

**Being Caught In The Water.** If a creature is swimming in an area where ice appears, it must make a Strength saving throw instead or become restrained by ice for the duration. A creature restrained by the ice or another creature that can reach it can also use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed. The target is also freed if any ice where at its location is destroyed. On a successful save, the creature can move below or above the now frozen surface.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the length of the line increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

Ice encases one willing Medium or smaller creature you can see within range. It is trapped inside a Medium-sized ice block object that occupies its space for the duration of the spell or until the ice is reduced to 0 hit points. The ice has an AC equal to your spell save; HP 50; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). A creature trapped inside the ice is blinded, restrained, incapacitated, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the ice, and becomes stable if it is at 0 hit points.

**Casting It As An Action.** You can choose to cast this spell as an action on your turn, choosing any creature within range. If the creature is not willing, it may make a Strength saving throw; on success, the spell ends and has no effect on the creature.

**Damaging The Ice From Within.** A creature inside the ice can choose to deal bludgeoning damage to the ice equal to 1d6 + its Strength modifier at the end of each of its turns.

**Casting It On Yourself.** If you cast the spell on yourself, it does not require Concentration, and you can choose to end the spell at the start of your turn. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the ice block gains 10 additional Hit Points for each slot level above 5th.

A burst of cold energy emanates from you in a 40-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a Strength saving throw. 

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 cold damage and is restrained by ice until the spell ends. At the end of each of its turns, while restrained this way, the target takes 2d6 cold damage. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage and the damage at the end of the restrained target's turn are increased by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
