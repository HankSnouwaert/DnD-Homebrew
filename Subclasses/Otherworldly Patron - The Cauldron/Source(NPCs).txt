## Otherworldly Patron

### The Cauldron
The source of your power is tied to eldritch <br> alchemy, and you can conjure a magical <br> cauldron through which you channel this <br> alchemy.  Your patron may have been a fiend, <br> hag, or powerful witch who bestowed the <br> cauldron upon you, or it may be the cauldron <br> itself, which possesses a bizarre, arcane <br> sentience.  Your power also might be derived <br> from a magical elixir you discovered or <br> concocted, to which your fate is now <br> irrevocably  bound.

However you came about this power, you <br> can now use your alchemical knowledge <br> to gather ingredients used to create arcane <br> elixirs and mystical brews.  Your enchanted <br> cauldron allows you to brew these concoctions, <br> and they can provide aid to your allies while <br> meeting out terrible fates to your enemies.

#### Expanded Spell List
*1st-level Cauldron feature*<br>
Your alchemical powers allow you to choose from <br> an expanded list of spells when you learn a <br> warlock spell.  The following spells are added to <br> the warlock spell list for you. 

##### Cauldron Expanded Spells
| Spell Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1st          | *caustic brew***, *ray of sickness* |
|  2nd          | *acid arrow****, *locate object*      | 
|  3rd          | *stinking cloud*, *life transference**  |
|  4th          | *locate creature*, *vitriolic sphere**   |
|  5th          | *reincarnate*, *cloudkill*   |

#### Hunt for Specimens
*1st-level Cauldron feature*<br>
 You gain proficiency in one of the following tools of your choice: alchemist’s supplies, brewer’s supplies, cook’s utensils, or herbalism kits.  At 6th level, your proficiency bonus when making checks using the chosen tool is doubled. 

 Additionally, you can use the chosen tool to acquire one or more magical ingredients by spending 1 minute harvesting the remains of a creature of CR 1/8 or higher that died within the last hour.  These ingredients are used for your other pact of the cauldron features but spoil and become useless 8 hours after being harvested.  When you make this harvest, roll on the Ingredient Properties tables to determine the type of ingredient you harvest.

You can harvest a number of ingredients each day equal to 1 + your warlock level.

  Roll for each ingredient harvested separately.

##### Ingredient Properties
| d4   |  Effect      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1         | Verdant |
|  2         | Pestilent |
|  3         | Acidic | 
|  4         | Invigorating |

#### Pestilent Cauldron
*1st-level Cauldron feature*<br>
You can perform a 1-hour ceremony to turn a small pot or cauldron into your magical vessel. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and any previous vessel is destroyed. The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC, its hit points equal five times your warlock level, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/h8y1p9P/Dina-Soul-Steeper-Chris-Rahn.jpg' style='position:absolute; top:-0px; right:-220px; width:900px; transform:rotate(0deg);filter:opacity(100%);'/>

\pagebreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


While you are within 20 feet of the vessel, you can cast your warlock spells as though you are holding a spell focus.  You can also use an action or bonus action to draw and throw a magical ingredient into the vessel to gain an effect based on its property, as described in the Ingredient Effects table.

##### Ingredient Effects
| Property   |  Effect      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  Verdant | You may have a target creature within 60 feet of your vessel that you can see regain a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus. |
|  Pestilent | You may make a ranged spell attack against a target creature within 60 feet of your vessel.  On a hit, the target takes 1d12 + your proficiency bonus necrotic damage. |
| Acidic | You choose a point within 60 feet of your vessel that you can see. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 1d6 + your proficiency bonus acid damage on a failed save.| 
| Invigorating | A target creature you can see within 60 feet of your vessel gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.| 

#### Witherbloom Brew
*6th-level Cauldron feature*<br>
When you complete a long rest, you may turn a number of rations equal to your proficiency modifier into ingredients as though you harvested them using your Hunt for Specimens feature.

Additionally, whenever you throw 3 or more ingredients into your vessel, all within a 24-hour period, you create a magical brew that is held inside your vessel. You can use a bonus action to harvest the brew from your vessel with an empty flask. The brew retains its magical potency for 24 hours or until it is used. 

\columnbreak

The effect of the brew depends on the last ingredient used to create it, as shown in the Brew Effects table below. A vessel can hold only one brew at a time, and if another brew is created in it before it is emptied, the old brew is destroyed.

A brew retains its potency for 8 hours unless you spend 200g worth of rare herbs and spices to preserve it.

##### Brew Effects
| Preperty   |  Effect      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  Verdant | A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient regains 5d8 hit points. |
|  Pestilent | As an action, a creature can apply this brew to a melee weapon or piece of ammunition. The effect lasts for 1 hour or until the weapon or a piece of ammunition hits a creature, causing the target to take 6d6 additional necrotic damage from the attack |
| Acidic | The vial with this brew can be treated as a simple thrown weapon with a range of 20 feet. On a hit, the target is covered in acid for 1 minute or until it or another creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to scrape or wash off the acid. A creature covered in the acid takes 6d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns.| 
| Invigorating | A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The creature administering the brew can end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the recipient: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned.| 


#### Pest Summoning
*10th-level Cauldron feature*<br>
You can use an action to call forth a pest into an unoccupied space that you can see within 20 feet of you. Roll to determine what type of property it has, as you would an ingredient. This property determines its abilities, as shown in its stat block on the next page, which also uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places.

The pest is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. You can command the pest on your turns as a bonus action, and you may throw a magical ingredient into the vessel as part of the same bonus action. If you don’t issue any command to the pest, it takes the dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

After 1 hour, or if you summon another pest, the pest stops obeying you and does everything it can to escape.

Regardless of whether it’s dead or alive, you can throw a pest into your vessel as though it’s an ingredient with the same property. The pest loses its potency as an ingredient 8 hours after it’s summoned unless you feed it 300g worth of rare herbs and spices to preserve it. 

You can summon a pest up to 3 times, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a long rest.

#### Infuse with Vitality
*14th-level Cauldron feature*<br>
You've learned how to prolong your life through eldritch alchemy. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year, and you are immune to being magically aged.

#### Unwilling Ingredient
*14th-level Cauldron feature*<br>
Whenever you use a pest as an ingredient in your vessel, the effects listed in the Empowered Effects table replace those listed in the Pestilent Cauldron feature.

##### Empowered Effects
| Property   |  Effect      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  Verdant | You may have up to three creatures that you can see within 60 feet of your vessel regain 4d6 hit points. |
|  Pestilent | Each creature of your choice that you can see within 60 feet of your vessel must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. A creature takes 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.|
| Acidic | You may make a ranged spell attack against a target creature within 100 feet of your vessel that you can see. On a hit, the target takes 5d6 acid damage immediately and 5d6 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the attack splashes for the initial damage and deals no damage at the end of the creature's next turn.| 
| Invigorating | You may choose a creature within 100 feet of your vessel that you can see. Until the start of your next turn, that creature has advantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws and can't suffer disadvantage imposed on it for any of these rolls. Additionally, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against the target, and they can't gain advantage on attack rolls against it.|

> ##### Personalized Pests
> While the pests here are inspired by the creatures of the same name from the Strixhaven setting, your pests can take a form unique to your character.  They could appear to be toads, crabs, lizards, or giant insects.  Regardless of their appearance, they still have the monstrosity creature type.
