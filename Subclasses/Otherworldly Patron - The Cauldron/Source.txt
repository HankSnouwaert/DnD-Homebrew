## Otherworldly Patron

### The Cauldron
The source of your power is tied to eldritch <br> alchemy, and you can conjure a magical <br> cauldron through which you channel this <br> alchemy.  Your patron may  have been a fiend, <br> hag, or powerful witch who bestowed the <br> cauldron upon you, or it may be the cauldron <br> itself, which possesses a bizarre, arcane <br> sentience.  Your power also might be derived <br> from a magical elixir you discovered or <br> concocted, which your fate is now irrevocably <br> bound to.

However you came about this power, you <br> can now use your alchemical knowledge <br> to  gather ingredients used to create arcane <br> elixirs and mystical brews.  Your enchanted <br> cauldron allows you to brew these concoctions, <br> and they can provide impressive aid to your <br> allies while meeting out terrible fates to your <br> enemies.  

#### Expanded Spell List
Your alchemical powers allow you to choose from <br> an expanded list of spells when you learn a <br> warlock spell.  The following spells are added to <br> the warlock spell list for you. 

##### Cauldron Expanded Spell List

#### Hunt for Specimens

Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency in one of the following tools of your choice: alchemist’s supplies, brewer’s supplies, cook’s utensils, or herbalism kits. At 6th level, your proficiency bonus when making checks using the chosen tool is doubled. 

 Additionally, you can use the chosen tool to acquire one or more magical ingredients by spending 1 minute harvesting the remains of a creature of CR 1/8 or higher that died within the last hour.  These ingredients are used for your other pact of the cauldron features, but spoil and become useless 8 hours after being harvested. When you make this harvest, roll on the Ingredient Types tables to determine the type of ingredient you harvest.

You can harvest a number of ingredients each day equal to 1 + your warlock level.
  Roll for each ingredient harvested separately.

##### Ingredient Types
| d4   |  Effect      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1         | Verdant |
|  2         | Pestilent |
|  3         | Acidic | 
|  4         | Invigorating |

#### Pestilent Cauldron
At 1st level, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to turn a small pot or cauldron into your magical vessel. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and any previous vessel is destroyed. The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC, its hit points equals five times your warlock level, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage.

While you are within 20 feet of the vessel, you can cast your warlock spells as though you are holding a spell focus and you can use an action or bonus action to pull out and throw a magical ingredient into the vessel and gain an effect based on the type of ingredient.

##### Ingredient Effects
| Ingredient   |  Effect      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  Verdant | You may have a target creature within 60 feet of your vessel that you can see regain a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus. |
|  Pestilent | You may make a ranged spell attack against a target creature within 60 feet of your vessel.  On a hit, the target takes 1d12 + your proficiency bonus necrotic damage. |
| Acidic | You choose a point within a 60 feet of your vessel that you can see. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 1d6 + your proficiency bonus acid damage on a failed save.| 
| Invigorating | A target creature you can see within 60 feet of your vessel gains advantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of it's next turn.| 

#### Witherbloom Brew
At 6th level, when you complete a long rest, you may turn a number of rations equal to your proficiency modifier into ingredients as though you harvested them using your Hunt for Specimens feature.

Additionally, whenever you throw 3 or more ingredients into your vessel, each within a minute of the next, you create a magical brew that is held inside your vessel. You can use an action to harvest the brew from your vessel with an empty flask. The brew retains its magical potency for 24 hours or until it is used. 

\columnbreak

The effect of the brew depends on the last ingredient used to create it, as shown in the table below. A vessel can hold only one brew at a time and if another brew is created it before it is harvested, the old one is destroyed.

A brew retains its  potency for 8 hours, unless you spend 200g worth rare of herbs and spices to preserve it.

##### Brew Effects
| Ingredient   |  Effect      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  Verdant | A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The recipient regains 5d8 hit points. |
|  Pestilent | As an action, a creature can apply this brew to a simple or martial weapon. The effect lasts for 1 hour or until the weapon or a piece of ammunition fired by it hits a creature, causing the target to take 6d6 additional necrotic damage from the attack |
| Acidic | The vial with this brew can be treated as an improvised thrown weapon with a range of 20 feet. On a hit, the target is covered in acid for the 1 minute or until it or another creature within 5 feet of it uses its action to scrape or wash off the acid. A creature covered in the acid takes 6d4 acid damage at start of each of its turns.| 
| Invigorating | A creature can drink this brew or administer it to another creature as an action. The creature administering the brew can end one disease or one of the following conditions affecting the recipient: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, poisoned, stunned.| 


#### Pest Summoning
Starting at 10th level, you can use an action to call forth a **pest** into an unoccupied space that you can see within 20 feet of you. Roll to determine what type of pest it is, as you would an ingredient.  This determines its abilities, as shown in its stat block on the next page.

The **pest** is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. You you can command the pest on your turns as a bonus action, and you may throw a magical ingredient into the vessel as part of the same bonus action. If you don’t issue any command to the pest, it takes the dodge action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

After 10 minutes, or if you summon another pest, the pest stops obeying you and does anything it can to escape.

Regardless of whether it's dead or alive, you can throw a pest into your vessel as though it's an ingredient with the property equivalent to the type of pest it is. The pest loses its potency as an ingredient 1 hour after its death or 8 hours after it's summoned unless you feed it 200g worth rare of herbs and spices to preserve it. 

You can summon a pest up to 3 times, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a long rest.
