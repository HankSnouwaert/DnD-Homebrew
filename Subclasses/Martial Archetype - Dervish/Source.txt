## Dervish
These lightly armored fighters specialize in weaving through the battlefield wielding slashing weapons in a beautiful but deadly dance of death.  Whereas many fighters don heavy suits of armor, dervishes shun such cumbersome defenses and instead rely on their mobility and evasiveness to stay alive.  Their use of slashing weapons allows them to attack in graceful sweeping motions with a dancer's poise.  These elegant movements enable them to blend attack, evasion, and mobility into one deadly dance.

In many desert-dwelling societies where heavy armor is too much of a liability, dervishes are the most common types of fighters.  Some of these dervishes even wield deadly double-bladed scimitars to magnificent effect.

#### Whirling Form
*3rd-level Dervish feature* <br>
As long as you are not wearing heavy or medium armor and not wielding a shield or heavy weapon, you gain the following benefits: 

* Your speed increases by 10 feet. This bonus increases to 20 feet when you reach 10th level in this class.

* You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) and Charisma (Performance) checks.

* When you use your second wind feature, you may immediately make an attack with a finesse weapon that deals slashing damage as part of that bonus action.

#### Dervish Dance
*3rd-level Dervish feature* <br>
During your turn, if you have moved at least 10 feet <br> through spaces that you have not occupied this turn immediately before making a melee weapon attack, <br> that attack deals an extra 1d4 damage on hit. <br> Regardless of whether the attack hit or missed, your <br> next 10 feet of movement don't provoke opportunity <br> attacks this turn.

#### Blade Blossom
*7th-level Dervish feature* <br>
In battle, you can now push yourself to become a <br> beautiful whirlwind of death.  When you use your <br> Action Surge feature, you can immediately make <br> a melee weapon attack against each creature <br> within 5 feet of you.  These attacks must be made <br> before taking the extra turn granted by action <br> surge and must use weapons that deal slashing <br>damage and have the finesse property.  Your <br> walking speed then increases by 20 feet until <br> the end of that turn.

#### Tireless Dance
*7th-level Dervish feature* <br>
When you use your Indomitable feature to reroll a saving throw against an effect that would reduce your movement speed, incapacitate you, or cause you to suffer a level of exhaustion, you don't expend a use of the feature.   You may also use your Indomitable when making saving throws against these types of effects, even if you don't have any uses of that feature left.

#### Blur of Blades
*15th-level Dervish feature* <br>
When you use your Second Wind feature, you may take the dodge action as part of that action. 

Additionally, when you take the dodge action, you may move up to 10 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. You may also make a weapon attack with a finesse weapon that deals slashing damage you are welding before or after this movement.

#### A Thousand Cuts
*18th-level Dervish feature* <br>
When you use your Action Surge feature, you regain a use of your Second Wind feature.
