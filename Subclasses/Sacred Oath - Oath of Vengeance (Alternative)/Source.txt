## Sacred Oath

### Oath of Vengeance (Alternative)
The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. When evil forces slaughter helpless villagers, when an entire people turns against the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent and powerful, when a dragon rampages through the countryside – at times like these, paladins arise and swear an Oath of Vengeance to set right that which has gone wrong. To these paladins – sometimes called avengers or dark knights – their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.

#### Tenets of Vengeance
The tenets of the Oath of Vengeance vary by paladin, but all the tenets revolve around punishing wrongdoers by any means necessary. Paladins who uphold these tenets are willing to sacrifice even their own righteousness to mete out justice upon those who do evil, so the paladins are often neutral or lawful neutral in alignment. The core principles of the tenets are brutally simple.

**Fight the Greater Evil.** You are a beacon of your legion and everything it stands for.  Inspire those ideals in your comrades

**No Mercy for the Wicked.** As one who carries the symbol of your legion, you must strive to live by the ideals it stands for

**By Any Means Necessary.** No battle is lost, so long as your legion's banner still stands

**Restitution** Seek out any opportunities to glorify and advance the cause of your legion

**Vow of Enmity.** As a bonus action, you can utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 10 feet of you, using your Channel Divinity. You gain advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until it drops to 0 hit points or falls unconscious.

#### Aura of Wrath
Starting at 7th level, you may use Lay on Hands on yourself as a bonus action.

Additionally, whenever you heal a creature with your Lay on Hands feature, you may force any number of creatures within 10 feet of you make Constitution save throw against your spell save DC  On a failed save, the creature takes 1d4 radiant damage for each 5 hit points healed this way.  On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

At 18th level, the range of this feature increases to 30 feet.

#### Channel Fury
Starting at 15th level, your Channel Divinity options gain the additional benefits.

**Celestial Charge.** When you use your Celestial Charge, you grow angelic wings, allowing you to make your charge in any direction.  The wings remain for 1 minute, granting you a fly speed of 40 ft.

**Vow of Enmity.** The authority with which you speak your Vow of Enmity gives you greater power over your foe. When a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity makes an attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature if it is within range.

#### Celestial Judgement
At 20th level, none can escape your divine vengeance. Using your action, you force a creature within 60 feet of you to make Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. If the creature's CR is lower then your class level, it automatically fails this save.

On a failed save, you are both teleported to center of a celestial demiplane, 30 feet apart from each other in a room 120 feet in each dimension. if the creature tries to use interplanar travel to leave or enter the plane, it must first make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit or enters the plane. On a failure, the creature can’t leave the plane and wastes the use of the spell or effect.

While in the room you have you gain the following benefits

* At the start of each of your turns, you gain 20 temporary hit points.

* You have advantage on saving throws against spells or effects caused by the trapped creature.

* As a bonus action, you can move up to your speed toward an trapped creature if you can see or hear it. You must end this movement closer to the creature than you started.

\columnbreak

You both remain in this demiplane until one of you is reduced to 0 hit points, 1 minute passes, or until a creature leaves or enters the plane using interplanar travel.  Once this happens, each creature exiting the plane appears in an unoccupied space of its choice within 60 ft. of where you first activated this ability

### New Feat
#### Impaler
You've learned how to brutally impale your foes with pole arm weapons, granting you the following benefits:

* If you move at least 15 feet in a straight line immediately before an attack with a glaive, halberd, pike, or spear, you have advantage on the attack and a roll of 19 or 20 results in a critical hit.

* When you score a critical hit with a glaive, halberd, pike, or spear you impale your target.  Impaled targets are grappled and restrained.  The impaling weapon cannot be used to make attacks against other targets unless they are directly behind the currently impaled target and the impaling weapon has enough reach to make the attack. The grappled and restrained conditions end on all targets if you drop the weapon.
