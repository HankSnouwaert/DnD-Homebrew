## Druid Circle

### Circle of Rivers
Druids of this circle watch over bodies of freshwater to ensure they remain untainted.  They’ve specialized in wielding watery magics while shapeshifting into creatures adept at river traversal.  These druids often travel vast distances via the rivers they call home and can serve as guides for those wishing to traverse such waters. 

#### Circle Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Rivers Feature* <br>
Your mystical connection to rivers infuses you with the ability to cast some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Rivers Spells table.
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 

##### Circle of Rivers Spells
| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *cure wounds*, *create or destroy water*  |
|  3rd          | *mirror image*, *misty step* |
|  5th          | *wall of water**, *water breathing*       | 
|  7th          | *aura of purity*, *control water*      |
|  9th          | *commune with nature*, *maelstrom**  |

*Found in *The Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

#### River Forms
*2nd Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You gain access to the following wild shape forms at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 16th levels.  The usual restrictions as to what you can wild shape into do not apply to these forms.  

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of spells from your Circle of Rivers Spells table.

| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | **Pygmy Hypo***, **Wolf Otter*** |
|  6th          | **Crocodile***, **Giant Toad**      | 
|  12th          | **Jaguar***, **Saltwater Crocodile***    |
|  16th          | **Giant Jaguar***, **Hippopotamus***|

*New creature stats listed later in document

#### River Dweller
*2nd Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You gain a swim speed equal to your walk speed and gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) checks relating to bodies of freshwater and the life that inhabits them.  

Additionally, you can speak with animals who primarily dwell in bodies of freshwater as though under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made while interacting with them.

#### Call of the Rapids
*6th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You may use an action to cause a river to spring into existence at a point you choose within 60ft.  The point must be on a solid surface or in a body of water.  The river is composed of three 10ft. deep by 10ft. wide by 20ft. long stretches of water that must each be contiguous with at least one other summoned stretch of water.  Once you've created the river, you choose the direction the water flows.  The water may flow uphill, over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions.  As an action, you can switch the direction of the river.  

Swimming upstream costs creatures double their movement, and swimming downstream costs creatures half their movement.  You may have any creature that starts its turn in the river make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failed save, the creature is pulled 20 feet downstream.

The river disappears after 1 minute, and once you've created a river, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3th level or higher.

\columnbreak

#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Avatar of the Waterways
*10th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You can wild shape into a **giant crocodile**, **hippopotamus gorgops**, **kelpie**, or **mishipeshu** for 1 hour. You can use your wild shape this way 2 times per day and regain all uses of this feature after completing a long rest. 

The stat blocks for these creatures can be found later in the document.

#### Master of Currents
*14th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You and creatures of your choice that you can see automatically pass all saving throws against your druid spells and effects that produce or influence water and ignore the movement penalties caused by these spells and effects.

Additionally, creatures of your choice that you can see within water produced or influenced by these spells or effects gain a swim speed equal to their move speed while within that water.

> ##### Panthers
> Some jaguars are born with black coats.  Referred to as panthers, these cats are more suited to sneaking through darker environments.  You can represent this by changing their Mask of the Jungle ability to function in areas of dim light rather than foliage.

**Giant Jaguars.**  These primeval beasts are the larger ancestors of modern jaguars.  Adapted to hunting <br> megafauna, giant jaguars stalk environments where <br>their large prey is plentiful.  They count even the <br> largest and most fearsome of beasts as their prey, and <br> most humanoids they find are little more than helpless snacks.

**Hippopotamus Gorgops.** These monstrous creatures are primeval relatives of the modern hippopotamus.  Growing 15 feet long, 7 feet high, and weighing nearly 10,000 pounds, the hippopotamus gorgops is a titan of the rivers.  Adventurers exploring remote and uncharted rivers may suddenly find themselves staring into the yawning jaws of these terrifying behemoths.

**Kelpies.** These are the most notorious and well-known of the water horses, as well as the female variant of these fey creatures. In their natural form, kelpies have long, reedy manes that drape across their pale, greenish complexions, and their eyes possess an eerily beautiful and haunting glow. When not in the water, kelpies drip with heavy mud, and their reeds weigh them down, preventing them from achieving the same level of land mobility as other horses. As such, they tend to stay closer to their homes than other water horses, preferring instead to lure creatures into their river domain.   

***Beguiling Predators.*** Kelpies prefer to prey upon lone, vulnerable targets, using their charms to separate an individual from nearby companions. They will then lure the victim out into the water, and once the isolated target touches the kelpie, it will quickly pull it to the bottom of its river home and well out of the reach of any help from its companions.  

***Charming Fey Steeds.*** River-dwelling fey prize kelpies as reliable and enchanting steeds, and especially powerful fey may have entire herds of kelpies at their command.  They may even grant the services of these kelpies to those in their favor.  This can result in some kelpies aiding noble heroes and serving as stalwart steeds in battles against other aquatic monstrosities.  

Other kelpies are put to more sinister use.  Hags enjoy utilizing kelpies to lure travelers into their clutches and will also employ kelpies in larger schemes, where they are used as spies.  Hags will sometimes “gift” a kelpie disguised as a beautiful horse to someone.  The kelpie then serves as a secret servant for the hag until the time comes to betray its would-be owner.

> ***Amphibious.*** The kelpie can breathe air and water..
>
> ***Charming Gaze.*** At the start of its turns, the kelpie can choose a creature it can see within 100 feet and force it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it becomes charmed and drops whatever it's holding. A creature charmed this way is incapacitated and spends each turn moving towards the kelpie by the most direct route available in an attempt to mount it. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks but won't move into direct harm.
>
> The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if this ability is used to charm a different creature. A creature that breaks free of the charm is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Suffocating Grasp.*** Each creature grappled by the kelpie and submerged in water must make a DC 15 Constitution. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 (7d8) necrotic damage and starts to suffocate if it can't breathe water. On a pass, it takes half as much damage and does not begin suffocating.
>
> ***Change Shape.*** The kelpie polymorphs into a large terrestrial beast or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It automatically reverts to its true form if it dies or is submerged in water.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Adhere.*** When a large or smaller creature hits the kelpie with a melee attack or touches it, the kelpie can adhere that creature to itself, causing it to automatically become grappled by the kelpie (escape DC 15).

**Mishipeshu.** This monstrous creature appears to be a large, aquatic cat equipped with copper horns and a long razor-sharp fin capable of slicing through steel. Mishipeshu serve as the malevolent guardians of rivers and lakes, and though they are fiendish in nature, they work with druidic sects to protect the specific bodies of water they are bound to.  

While they protect the sanctity of their watery homes, they do so with cruel brutality. Any creature that contaminates their waters in the slightest is subject to their terrible ire, and trespassers are often ambushed and torn to pieces without ever knowing what they did to incur the mishipeshu's wrath.

**Pygmy Hippos.** This smaller cousin to the common hippopotamus is quite elusive.  Pygmy hippos only reach 6 feet in length, 3 feet in height, and weigh in at up to 600 pounds.  This, combined with their reclusive and solitary nature, makes them difficult to locate.  

They are much less common than other hippos, and <br> their group sizes are much smaller, though local druids <br> and other forest folk will often befriend them.  Smaller <br> forest dwellers, such as forest gnomes, will sometimes <br> use pygmy hippos as mounts and beasts of burden and <br> are very protective of their hippopotamid friends.

**Wolf Otters.** These ancient creatures are the largest otters to have ever lived.  True to their name, wolf otters can grow to the size of a wolf.  With a bite force equivalent to a bear, these primeval creatures have a wide range of prey options.  

While not commonly known to most folk, wolf otters make effective patrol and hunting animals when working with druids or other powerful beings of nature who live near remote riverways.  A pack of aggressive wolf otters can easily spell doom for a group of inexperienced explorers trespassing through their territory.
