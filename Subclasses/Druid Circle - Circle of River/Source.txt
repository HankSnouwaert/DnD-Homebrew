## Druid Circle

### Circle of Rivers
Druids of this circle watch over bodies of freshwater to ensure they remain untainted.  They’ve specialized in wielding watery magics while shapeshifting into creatures adept at river traversal.  These druids often travel vast distances via the rivers they call home and can serve as guides for those wishing to traverse such waters. 

#### Circle Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Rivers Feature* <br>
Your mystical connection to rivers infuses you with the ability to cast some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Rivers Spells table.
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 

##### Circle of Rivers Spells
| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | *cure wounds*, *create or destroy water*  |
|  3rd          | *mirror image*, *misty step* |
|  5th          | *wall of water**, *water breathing*       | 
|  7th          | *aura of purity*, *control water*      |
|  9th          | *commune with nature*, *maelstrom**  |

*Found in *The Xanathar's Guide to Everything*

#### River Forms
*2nd Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You gain access to the following wild shape forms at 2nd, 6th, 12th, and 16th levels.  The usual restrictions as to what you can wild shape into do not apply to these forms.  

While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of spells from your Circle of Rivers Spells table.

| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Pygmy Hypo*, Wolf Otter* |
|  6th          | Crocodile*, Giant Toad      | 
|  12th          | Jaguar*, Saltwater Crocodile*    |
|  16th          | Giant Jaguar*, Hippopotamus*|

*New creature stats listed later in document

#### River Dweller
*2nd Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You gain a swim speed equal to your walk speed and gain advantage on Wisdom (Survival) and Intelligence (Nature) checks relating to bodies of freshwater and the life that inhabits them.  

Additionally, you can speak with animals who primarily dwell in bodies of freshwater as though under the effects of the *speak with animals* spell, and you have advantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks made while interacting with them.

#### Call of the Rapids
*6th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You may use an action to cause a river to spring into existence at a point you choose within 60ft.  The point must be on a solid surface or in a body of water.  The river is composed of three 10ft. deep by 10ft. wide by 20ft. long stretches of water that must each be contiguous with at least one other summoned stretch of water.  Once you've created the river, you choose the direction the water flows.  The water may flow uphill, over obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions.  As an action, you can switch the direction of the river.  

Swimming upstream costs creatures double their movement, and swimming downstream costs creatures half their movement.  You may have any creature that starts its turn in the river make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failed save, the creature is pulled 20 feet downstream.

The river disappears after 1 minute, and once you've created a river, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or until you expend a spell slot of 3th level or higher.

\columnbreak

#### Primal Weapons
*6th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
If you merge into any of your wild shapes with a magical weapon you are wielding, your attacks in that wild shape count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

#### Avatar of the Waterways
*10th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You can wild shape into a **giant crocodile**, **hippopotamus gorgops**, **kelpie**, or **mishipeshu** for 1 hour. You can use your wild shape this way 2 times per day and regain all uses of this feature after completing a long rest. 

The stat blocks for these creatures can be found later in the document.

#### Master of Currents
*14th Level Circle of Rivers feature* <br>
You and creatures of your choice that you can see automatically pass all saving throws against your druid spells and effects that produce or influence water and ignore the movement penalties caused by these spells and effects.

Additionally, creatures of your choice that you can see within water produced or influenced by these spells or effects gain a swim speed equal to their move speed while within that water.

**Giant Jaguars.**  These primeval beasts are the larger ancestors of modern jaguars.  Adapted to hunting <br> megafuana, giant jaguars stalk environments where <br>their large prey is plentiful.  They count even the <br> largest and most fearsome of beasts as their prey, and <br>most humanoids they find are little more than helpless snacks.

**Hippopotamus Gorgops.** These monstereous creatures are primeval relatives of the modern hippopotamus.

> **Amphibious.** The kelpie can breathe air and water..
>
> **Charming Gaze.** At the start of each of it's turns, the kelpie can choose a creature that it can see within 100ft of it and force that creature to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed and drop whatever its holding. A creature charmed this way is incapacitated and spends each turn moving towards the kelpie by the most direct route available in an attempt to mount it. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but does not move into direct harm.
>
> At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can repeat the Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it’s triggered by damage. On a success it breaks free of the charm. The charm also ends if this ability is used to charm a different creature.  A creature that breaks free of the charm is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Suffocating Grasp.*** Each creature attached to the kelpie and submerged in water must make a DC 15 Constitution. On a failed save, a creature takes 31 (7d8) necrotic damage and starts to suffocate if it can't breath water. On a pass, it takes half as much damage and does not begin suffocating.
>
> ***Change Shape.*** The kelpie polymorphs into a large terrestrial beast, or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It automatically reverts to its true form if it dies or is submerged in water.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Adhesive.*** When a large or smaller creature hits the kelpie with a melee attack or touches it, the kelpie can adhere that creature to itself, causing it to automatically become grappled (escape DC 15). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.

**Kelpies.** These shapeshifting river fey use their charms and adhesive flesh to prey upon unsuspecting travelers. In their natural form, they look like pale horses with long, reedy manes, and hauntingly glowing eyes.  Their preferred form is that of a beautiful horse though they lack the land speed of a true horse.  

\columnbreak

Because of this, the kelpie will use its fey charms in an attempt to lure potential victims to it.  Once the target touches the kelpie, it will become stuck and unable to flee.  At this point the kelpie drags the creature down to the bottom of its watery home, drowning the victim before feasting on its new meal.

**Mishipeshu.** This monstruous creature appears to be large, aquatic cat equipped with a set of copper horns and a long razor sharp fin capable of slicing through steel. Mishipeshu serve as the malevolent guardians of rivers and lakes, and though they are fiendish in nature, they work with druidic enclaves to protect the specific bodies of water they are bound too.  

While they do protect the sanctity of their watery homes, they do so with cruel brutality.  Any creature that contaminates their waters in the slightest is subject to their terrible ire, and trespassers are often ambushed and torn to pieces without ever knowing what they did to incur the mishipeshu's wrath.

**Pygmy Hippos.** This smaller cousin to the common hippopotamus is quite elusive.  Pygmy hippos only reach 6 feet in length, 3 feet in height, and weight in at up to 600 pounds.  This, combined with their reclusive and solitary nature, makes them difficult to locate.  

They are much less common than other hippos and <br> their group sizes are much smaller, though local druids <br> and other forest folk will often befriend them.  Smaller <br> forest dwellers, such as forest gnomes, will sometimes <br> use pygmy hippos as mounts and beasts of burden, and <br> are very protective of their hippopotamid friends.

**Wolf Otters.** These ancient creatures are the largest otters to have ever lived.  True to their name, wolf otters can grow to the size of a wolf.  With a bite force equivalent to a bear, these primeval creatures have a wide range of prey options.  

While not commonly known to most folk, wolf otters make effective patrol and hunting animals when working with druids or other powerful beings of nature who live near remote riverways.  A pack of aggressive wolf otters can easily spell doom for a group of inexperienced explorers trespassing through their territory.
