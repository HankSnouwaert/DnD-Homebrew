# Roguish Archetype

## Shadow Dancer
These rogues possess a strange power over their shadows. Whether through research into the occult, a traumatic paranormal event, a bargain with a dark power, or a strange form of self-mastery, these rogues have gained the ability to control their shadow and utilize its aid in supernatural ways. Their shadows can split off and act as independent beings capable of interacting with the world. As the rogue’s power grows, so does that of its shadow. 

The exact nature of the shadow depends on the origin of the rogue’s power. One rogue’s shadow might be a bound and subservient creature, and another’s shadow might be a twisted reflection of the rogue’s soul that has momentarily found a way to split off. 

#### Living Shadow
*3rd level Shadow Dancer feature*<br>
You've learned to split your shadow from yourself and control it as an independent entity. You gain the ability to cast the *find familiar* spell as action and without components. 

Once you cast *find familiar* this way, you can't do so until you finish a short or long rest. When casting it this way, you must choose the creeping shadow as your familiar. The shadow gains the following benefits:

\columnbreak

* The shadow becomes your size. 

* It uses your roll modifiers for saving throws and checks, including any benefits you gain from the Expertise feature. 

* Its AC equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier, and it has a number of hit points equal to two times your rogue level. 

* It gains your Cunning Action feature. Later it gains Uncanny Dodge, Evasion, Reliable Talent, Blindsense, and Elusive when you gain these features in the rogue class.

#### Shadow Sight
*3rd level Shadow Dancer feature*<br>
You gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision from your race, the range of your darkvision and the darkvision of the creeping shadow you summon with your Living Shadow feature both increase by 30 feet. 

#### Shadow Strike
*9th level Shadow Dancer feature*<br>
Your shadow becomes powerful enough to make attacks of its own. You can command the creeping shadow you summon using your Living Shadow feature (no action required) to take the Attack action on its next turn. It uses your Dexterity modifier + your Proficiency Bonus for the attack roll and adds your Dexterity modifier to the damage roll.

It may also add your sneak attack damage if it hits, provided you did not use your sneak attack on the turn you commanded it and that it meets the requirements for triggering a sneak attack. If your shadow does sneak attack this way, you can't make a sneak attack until the start of your next turn.

#### Shadow Stage
*13th level Shadow Dancer feature*<br>
As an action, you cause the area within 10 feet of you and the area within 10 feet of the creeping shadow you summon using your Living Shadow ability to become covered in darkness for the next minute or until you are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again. These areas can't be illuminated by nonmagical light. While a creature is standing in either area of darkness, you and your shadow are invisible to it if you are also standing in one of the areas of darkness.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

#### Shadow Shift
*17th level Shadow Dancer feature*<br>
When you and your creeping shadow are both in dim light or darkness, and within 60 feet of each other, either of you can use your bonus actions to magically swap places.

##### Example Shadow Dancer Origins

| d4  | Origin |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | You attempted a ritual to cleanse the darkness from your heart, but it was distilled into a wicked shadow of yourself. |
|  2  |A fey creature you made a bargain with has twisted your shadow to serve as its eyes and ears in the Material Plane.  |
|  3  | You were struck by a blinding flash of light from the Far Realm, and the shadow it created has taken on a life of its own.   |
|  4  | You lost a family member to a terrible tragedy, but their shadow continues to follow you.|

> ##### The Shadow's Creature Type
> Depending on the origin of your rogue's powers, a different creature type might make more sense for your shadow familiar. At your DM's discretion, you can change its creature type to Aberration, Fey, Fiend, or Undead.
