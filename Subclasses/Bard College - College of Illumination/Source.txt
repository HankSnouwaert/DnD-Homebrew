## Bard College

### College of Illumination
Bards of this college masterfully manipulate light and dark to embolden their allies and demoralize their foes.  Their shining spotlights can highlight one's strengths to boost their confidence or draw full attention to their weaknesses to cripple their resolve.  With their shadowy minions, they can cloak and goad their allies while blinding and berating their enemies.  For better or worse, these bards can expose all one's strengths and weaknesses, and no shadow escapes their scrutinizing light. 

#### Lightscribe
When you join the College of Elements at 3rd level, you learn the *darkness* spell.  It counts as a bard spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of spells your know.

Additionally, when your spellcasting feature lets you learn a bard cantrip or a bard spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose any spell from any spell list that creates light or deals radiant damage.  If the spell deals damage, it must only be capable of dealing radiant damage. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a bard spell for you.

#### Dramatic Spotlight
At 3rd level, you can summon a spotlight that emboldens an ally with praise and adoration or cripples an enemy with scorn and scrutiny.  As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your bardic inspiration to conjure a magical spotlight focused on a creature you can see within 60 feet of you.  The spotlight’s size always matches the target creature’s, and it will follow the target wherever it moves. The spotlight lasts for 1 minute, until you use this feature again, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

While a spotlight is active, you can use your bonus action to move it to another creature you can see within 60 feet of you.  Additionally, if the spotlight’s target drops to 0 hit points before the effect ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to refocus it on a new creature.

An allied creature targeted by the spotlight gains the following benefits:

* It can see through magical and non-magical darkness out to 120 feet.

* It has advantage on Charisma checks

An enemy creature targeted by the spotlight suffers the following effects:
* It loses all abilities that would allow it to see through darkness or turn invisible.

* It has disadvantage on Charisma checks

The first time on a turn, when a creature targeted by the spotlight deals damage, you can increase or reduce the damage dealt to a single target by an amount equal to a roll of your bardic inspiration die.  If you increase the damage, the additional damage is radiant. 

You can modify damage this way up to three times per use of a spotlight.

#### Inkling Summoning
At 6th level, you learn to summon an elemental being formed from the psychic energy of scorn and praise known as an **inkling**.  You can use your action to summon an **inkling** at an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you. It lasts for 1 hour, or until you dismiss it (no action required).  

In combat, the **inkling** shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action.
That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the **inkling** can take any action of its choice, not just dodge.  

When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature or your Dramatic Spotlight feature, you can command the **inkling** as part of the same bonus action you use for Bardic Inspiration.

Once you summon an **inkling** you can't do so again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use this feature again. You can have only one **inkling** at a time.



#### Beaming Defiance
At 14th level, the potency of your spotlight is significantly increased, and it gains the following additional effects based on whether it is focused on an enemy or an ally:  

* Allied creatures gain a 30 foot fly speed.

* When an enemy is first targeted by your spotlight, you can force it to make a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC.  On a failure, its move speed is reduced by 15 feet, and it is subjected to the effects of the *earthbind* spell.
