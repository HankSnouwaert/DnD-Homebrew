## Sorcerous Origin

### Elemental Conflux
You have been altered by raw elemental energies, not by a single element, but by all four.  These elements rage against each other within you, each fighting to be unleashed.  Your success depends upon your ability to not only balance these energies against each other but to blend them into unique and devastating magical effects containing amalgamations of the different elements.  Sorcerers of this origin are often unstable and chaotic. However, those who master their talents can use their powers to create expressive elemental magics that blend the elements into unique and creative effects.
### Variant: Origin Spells
You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Elemental Spells table.  Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.

#### Expressive Iteration
At 1st level, you gain a special proclivity with elemental spells.  An elemental spell is any spell that deals damage or forces creatures to make a saving throw and falls within one of the categories defined in the Elemental Spells table below.  If a spell has effects that fit the description for multiple elements, you can choose which one you wish to consider it as when you cast it.

##### Elemental Spells
| Element  |  Spells of this Element      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  Earth        | Spells that conjure, manipulate, or deal damage using earth or stone |
|  Fire         | Spells that conjure, manipulate, or deal damage using fire or heat  |
|  Water        | Spells that conjure, manipulate, or deal damage using acid, ice, water, or cold      | 
|  Air          | Spells that conjure, manipulate, or deal damage using wind, lighting, or thunder |

Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that is an elemental spell, you can choose to have the spell deal an additional 1d4 damage to a target who you hit with a spell attack roll as part of the spell or who failed a saving throw against the spell.  The damage type depends on the spellâ€™s element, as shown in the table below.  The damage die increases to a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 10th level, and a d10 at 15th level.

The target also suffers an additional effect based on the element as shown in the table below.  

##### Elemental Die Effects
| Element  |                                  Effect                                  |  Damage Type  |
|:--------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|
| Earth    | The target is knocked prone                                              | Bludgeoning   | 
| Fire     | The target takes additional damage equal to a roll of your elemental die | Fire
| Water    | The target's move speed is reduced by 20ft.                              | Cold
| Air      | You can move the target up to 10ft. in any direction of your choice      | Lightning


After you reach 3rd level, whenever you spend sorcery points on any elemental spell, you can choose to forgo the extra damage and effect to instead store an elemental die matching the element of the spell cast.  

When you cast an elemental spell, you can expend all your current elemental die to add their effects to the spell.  If you are expending multiple elemental dice, you may have different dice target different creatures effected by the spell.  
All stored elemental dice must be expended on the same spell, along with the elemental die that spell would produce.

You can have up to 1 elemental die per element and lose all your current elemental die after completing a long rest.

#### Elemental Amalgams
Starting at 6th level, when you cast a sorcerer spell that summons one or more elementals, you may expend all your elemental die to create enhanced elemental amalgams.  The summoned elementals gain the following benefits based on the elemental die used.

| Elemental Die  | Enhancement |
|:------:|:-----------:|
|  Earth | The elemental gains a burrow speed of 20ft, and its AC increases by 2 |
|  Fire  | Creatures that start their turn grappling the elemental, or hit it with a melee attack while within 5ft of it, take fire damage equal to your proficiency modifier |
|  Water | The elemental gains a swim speed of 30 ft, and creatures hit by its melee attacks are automatically grappled |
|  Air   | The elemental gains a fly speed of 60 ft |

#### Mercurial Artist
At 14th level, you transfer your stored elemental power into small sculptures.  As an action, you can expend all your current elemental die to creature a small sculpture.  Note what elemental die were used in the sculpture's creation.  You can have a number of elemental sculptures at once equal to your Charisma modifier.  

As part of an action or bonus action used to cast a spell, you can shatter a sculpture, thereby adding all the elemental die it had stored to the spell.  This can be used in combination with any other elemental die you were adding to the spell.

#### Elemental Masterpiece
Starting at 18th level, when you add elemental die to a spell, you can apply metamagic to it as though you spent a number of sorcery points equal to the elemental die spent.
