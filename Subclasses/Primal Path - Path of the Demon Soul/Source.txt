## Primal Path

### Path of the Demon Soul
Barbarians who follow this accursed path discover a demonic presence within themselves, yearning for release.  This presence may be the result of a demonic curse, over exposure to Abyssal magics, or even demonic possession.  In any case, when these barbarians lose control, their fiendish nature manifests itself visibly, warping their appearance and allowing them to unleash an unholy fury upon their foes.

#### Demonic Surges
When you reach 3rd level, the dark powers coursing through you give you access to demonic abilities in the form of Demonic Surges. Demonic Surges are supernatural abilities that momentarily boost your combat abilities or create demonic spell-like effects. If a Demonic Surge requires you to make an attack roll, treat the attack as though it is being made with a simple weapon.  If a Demonic Surge requires a saving throw, you use your Constitution modifier to determine the DC.

<div align="center"> 

**Surge save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

**Surge Slots.** The Demonic Surges table shows how many surge slots you have to use Demonic Surges of 1st level and higher.  To use one of these surges you must expend a slot of the surge's level or higher. You regain all expended Surge Slots when you complete a long rest.

**Surges Known of 1st-Level and Higher.** You know three 1st-level Demonic Surges of your choice from the list at the end of this document.

The Surges Known column of the Demon Soul Surges table shows when you learn more Demonic Surges of 1st level or higher.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the surges you know with another surge of your choice. This surge must be of a level for which you have surge slots.

On a fail, the creature can't move into any space within the darkness for the rest of its turn. You may choose to have a creature automatically pass the saving throw if you can see it.
