## Primal Path

### Path of the Demon Soul
Barbarians who follow this accursed path discover a demonic presence within themselves, yearning for release. This presence may be the result of a demonic curse, overexposure to Abyssal magics, or even demonic possession. In any case, when these barbarians lose control, their fiendish nature manifests itself visibly, warping their appearance and allowing them to unleash an unholy fury upon their foes.


#### Demonic Surges
*3rd level Path of the Demon Soul feature*<br>
The dark powers coursing through you give you access to demonic abilities in the form of Demonic Surges. Demonic Surges are supernatural abilities that momentarily boost your combat abilities or create fiendish spell-like effects. If a Demonic Surge requires you to make an attack roll, treat the attack as though it is being made with a simple weapon. If a Demonic Surge requires a saving throw, you use your Strength modifier to determine the DC.

**Summon Demon** You utter foul abyssal words, call a demon forth from the chaos of the Abyss. Choose a demon of CR 5 or lower  such as a **Shadow Demon** or a **Barlgura**. The demon appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or after 1 hour has passed.

The demon obeys your commands, and in combat, it shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. The demon spends its turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons, unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take a different action. That action can be one that is listed in its stat block or any other action that the demon would be capable of.

**Soul Rend.** Your chest cracks open and projects a vortex of life-draining energy out to 30 feet from you. Each creature in the area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. For each creature that is small or larger dropped to 0 hit points by this effect, it dies and you regain hit points equal to the number of Hit Dice it had.

**Doul Mind. new** when you enter a into a rage or as a bonus action while ragging, you case you rage to form another mind and even another head to grow from your body. You have advantage on all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws and checks, as well as saving throws against being blinded, deafened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. Additional first time you expend a 1st level Demonic Surge on your turn, until the end of the turn, you may use that same surge again with out expending a surge slot. The mind disappears if your rage ends, one minute passes, or you modify your rage with another surge.

|  4  | You were the subject of dark and bizarre arcane experiments.  |
|  5  | All you remember were fiends attacking your town.  Now, when you're in danger, you black out.  When you come to, you're surrounded by bodies and left with only brief flashes of what happened. |
