## Bard College

### College of The Ancients
While many bards seek out lost lore, those from the college <br>of antiquity possess an unmatched devotion to recovering secrets lost to history.  These bards are not content to merely study old legends and decipher ancient texts; they summon the spirits of the past, learning from their ancient wisdom and utilizing their skills to overcome the adversities of the present.

#### Ancient Companion
At 3rd level, you learn to call on the spirits of the ancient dead.  As a ritual over 10 minutes, you can call forth and bond with one such spirit, who comes to inhabit a spiritual vessel within 10 feet of you and serves as your ancient companion.  This vessel can be any small or medium non-magical object that is not being carried or worn by another creature.  

Choose the type of spirit you bond with: Healer, Sage, or Warrior. Your choice of spirit determines its stat block. These stat blocks can be found at the end of the document and they use your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. You may change the spirit when you complete a short rest.
it's statistics change expect it keeps it's current hit points.
 
While you are within 100 ft. of your companion, you gain proficiency in any skills it has proficiency in.  If you already have proficiency in the skill, you gain expertise.  
 
The ancient companion is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lasts until you take a long rest, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.
 
In combat, the ancient companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action.

  That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the ancient companion can take any action of its choice, not just dodge. 

 When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the ancient companion as part of the same bonus action.

 As an action, you can touch the ancient companion and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. The ancient companion regains a number of hit points equal to 10 times the level of spell slot expended.
 
 Once you call an ancient companion with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to use this feature again.  If you use this feature by expending a spell slot, the companion has hit points equal to 5 times the level of spell slot expended + 10. You can have only one Ancient Companion summoned using this feature at a time; if you summon another and already have an ancient companion from this feature, the first one immediately reverts back to an inanimate object.
