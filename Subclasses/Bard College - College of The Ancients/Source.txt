## Bard College

### College of The Ancients
While many bards seek out lost lore, those from the college <br>of antiquity possess an unmatched devotion to recovering secrets lost to history.  These bards are not content to merely study old legends and decipher ancient texts; they summon the spirits of the past, learning from their ancient wisdom and utilizing their skills to overcome the adversities of the present.

#### Ancient Companion
At 3rd level, you learn to call on the spirits of the ancient dead.  As a ritual over 10 minutes, you can call forth and bond with one such spirit, who comes to inhabit a spiritual vessel within 10 feet of you and serves as your ancient companion.  This vessel can be any small or medium non-magical object that is not being carried or worn by another creature.  

Choose the type of spirit you bond with: Healer, Sage, or Warrior. Your choice of spirit determines its stat block. These stat blocks can be found at the end of the document and they use your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. 
 
While you are within 100 ft. of your companion, you gain proficiency in any skills it has proficiency in.  If you already have proficiency in the skill, you gain expertise.  
 
The ancient companion is friendly to you and your companions and obeys your commands. It lasts until you take a long rest, until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until you die.
 
In combat, the ancient companion shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the Dodge action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action.
 
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
 
  That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the ancient companion can take any action of its choice, not just dodge. 

 When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature, you can command the ancient companion as part of the same bonus action.

 As an action, you can touch the ancient companion and expend a spell slot of 1st-level or higher. The ancient companion regains a number of hit points equal to 10 times the level of spell slot expended.
 
 Once you call an ancient companion with this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest or expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to use this feature again.  If you use this feature by expending a spell slot, the companion has hit points equal to 5 times the level of spell slot expended + 5. You can have only one Ancient Companion summoned using this feature at a time; if you summon another and already have an ancient companion from this feature, the first one immediately reverts back to an inanimate object.

#### Ancestral  Command
At 3rd level, when you command your ancient companion, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to have your companion perform one of the following abilities using its reaction depending on the type of spirit it is:

**Sage.** Your companion uses its spirit bolt attack.  Additionally, if the attack hits a creature, the companion can push or pull the creature a number of feet equal to a <br> roll of your Bardic Inspiration die * 5 towards or away from itself.

**Healer.** The companion may touch a creature other then its self that is within its melee reach. The creature regains hit points equal to one roll of your bardic dice + your proficiency bonus. 

**Warrior.**  Your companion gains AC equal to the one roll of your bardic dice until the start of your next turn and gains temporary hit points equal to the roll + your proficiency bonus.


#### Lessons of the Past
Starting at 6th level, through your studies, you learn how to better listen and take to heart the teachings of history. While you are within 100ft. of your companion, you have advantage on ability checks using skills the companion is proficient in.  You also gain an additional benefit based on the companion you've summoned:  When you bond with your ancient companion, you and you companion gain the following additional benefits depending on the type of spirit you chose:

**Sage.** You gain the spirit bolt attack option of your companion and both your ranges for this attack are increased to 120ft. 

**Healer.** When a creature with 10 feet of your or companion would roll one or more dice to restore hit points, any roll of a 1 or 2 may be rerolled. The new roll must be used, even if it is a 1 or 2.

**Warrior.**  You may choose to have your AC as well as your companion's AC become 17, regardless of what kind of armor either of you are benefiting from.

#### Lorehold Command
Starting at 14th level, the bond with your ancient companion can now be shared with others.  When you use your Bardic Inspiration feature and command your ancient companion as part of the same bonus action, your ancient companion can perform it's Ancient Command action with expending a use of Bardic Inspiration.  

Additionally, while you are bonded with your ancient companion, a creature with your Bardic Inspiration can expend it as a bonus action to perform an action described in your ancient command feature. The ancient command used this way must be the one used by the ancient companion you are currently bonded with and it uses your spell modifier and proficiency bonus as it would for your companion.
