## Sacred Oath

### Oath of Wrath
This oath is taken by paladins who see evil and corruption as a cancer on the world which needs to be burned from existence. To them, fire is the ultimate representation of righteous fervor and the ultimate tool for the eradication of evil. Some paladins following this oath are valiant crusaders, wielding divine flames to purge evil.  Others are brutal zealots, ruthlessly burning away those they see as weak or corrupt.

#### Tenets of Wrath
The tenets of the Oath of Wrath enforce an unyielding drive to purge evil through righteous fire. How broadly this evil is defined and who is put to the flame depends on the paladin.

**Display Your Fervor Through Flame.** Fire is the ultimate representation of fervor and devotion.  Let yours be reflected through the intensity of your flame.

**Purification is Painful.** If cleansing corruption were painless, everyone would take up the task.  You must be willing to bear the painful burden of purging evil.

**Ignite the Righteousness of Others.** As a fire ignites its surroundings, so to must your righteous fury ignite the souls of the comrades surrouding you 

**Fight the Fire with Fire.** Fiends wield mighty flames to achieve their wicked ends.  Your flames shall be mightier, and you will show them what it truly means to burn.

#### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the <br> following two Channel Divinity Options.

**Flaming Weapon.** As a bonus action, you can cause a melee weapon you are holding to light up in righteous fire for 1 minute.  During this time, when you make a weapon attack using the enhanced weapon, all creatures of your choice within 10 feet of the attack take 1d4 fire damage as flames rush out from your weapon.  This effect ends early if you end your turn without the weapon in hand.

If you use your divine smite or improved divine smite with the flaming weapon, you may change the damage type to fire.  If you do so, you may choose to exchange any number of d8s of damage against the primary target for 1d4 fire damage to each creature of your choice within 10 feet of the target per d8 exchanged.

**Purge by Fire.** When you deal damage to a creature you can see within 120 feet of you using a divine smite or a paladin spell that deals fire damage, you can choose to expend a use of your channel divinity to instantly cast *dispel magic* on that creature without expending a spell slot or requiring components.  You can do this even if you do not have *dispel magic* prepared.  

If the damage was dealt using a spell or smite that expended a spell slot of 3rd level or greater, the *dispel magic* is cast at the level of the spell slot expended. 


#### Burning Aura
Starting at 7th level, you gain an aura of cleansing flame that extends 10 feet out from you. You and friendly creatures within the aura gain resistance to fire damage.  Additionally, fiends and undead within the aura can't benefit from fire resistance or immunity against your paladin spells and effects.  

Enemies within the aura who take fire damage from one of your paladin spells or features catch on fire.  While on fire, the creature suffers the following effects.
