## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Venom
Druids of the Circle of Venom revere nature's most <br> subtle and deadly creatures. To them, the brute strength <br> of mighty beasts is less impressive than the lethal poisons of smaller, more unassuming creatures.   

These druids see the venom produced by poisonous creatures as the ultimate expression of nature's deadly potential. They spend their training learning how to maximize the lethality of these poisons, and even use them against creatures that would otherwise be resistant or even immune to their effects.

#### Venomous Forms
When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain the ability to use Wild Shape on your turn as a bonus action, rather than as an action.

Additionally, when you choose this circle at 2nd level, you gain access to the following wild shape forms at 2nd, 4th, and 8th level.  The usual restrictions as to what you can wild shape into do not apply to these forms.

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Black Mamba*, Wandering Spider* |
|  6th          | Poison Dart Frog*, Fat-tailed scorpion*.      | 
|  12th          | King Cobra*   |
|  16th          | Giant Scorpion*     |

#### Circle Spells
At 2nd level, you learn your choice of the *Poison Spray* or *Infestation* cantrips.

You also learn *Ray of Sickness*, and always have that spell prepared and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.  It counts as a druid spell for you.

At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of Venom Spells table.

Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.


| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  3rd          | Protection from Poison |
|  5th          | Stinking Cloud     | 
|  7th          | Giant Insect     |
|  9th          | Cloudkill   |

#### Poison Savant
At 2nd level, you gain proficiency with Poisoner's Kits, and poisons applied to your weapons carry over to your natural weapons when they meld with you while using Wild Shape. 

Additionally, upon completing a long rest, you may chose a creature type other than Constructs to focus your poisons against.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Until you complete another long rest, <br> your spells and attacks ignore poison resistance <br> possessed by creatures of that type, and deal half damage to creatures of that type who are immune to poison damage. 
You can also apply the poisoned condition to creatures of the chosen type that are normally are immune. These creatures make their saves against your poison with advantage.

#### Venom Master
Starting at 6th level, you no longer have to choose a creature type to focus your poisons against.  Your Poison Savant feature now applies to all creatures types other than constructs at all times.

Additionally, when you roll damage for an attack or spell that deals poison damage, you can treat any 1 on a damage die as a 2. 

Finally, when a druid spell lets you choose a damage type (such as *Elemental Bane* or *Absorb Elements*) you may choose poison damage even if it is not listed as a choice.

#### Twin Fang
Starting at 10th level, you can use an action to create two fangs made of poison and hurl them at targets within 100 feet of you. You can hurl them both at one target or at two separate targets. 

Make a ranged spell attack for each fang. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 poison damage and must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save. On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of your next turn. If the creature hit this way is already poisoned, the attack deals 4d6 poison damage instead.

You can use this feature twice. You regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Amplify Toxin
Starting 14th level, at the start of you turn, you can force a poisoned creature you can see within 100 feet of you to take poison damage equal to you half your druid level.
