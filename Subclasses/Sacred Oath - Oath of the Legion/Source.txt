## Sacred Oath

### Oath of the Legion
The Oath of the Legion binds paladins to a set of <br> ideals held by a military force.  The nature of this force <br> can vary greatly, from a small bands of freedom fighters to large nation states.  The commonality between all paladins of this oath is their devotion to their legion and the ideals it stands for.  

As an expression of their devotion and a means of inspiring others, these paladins carry banners bearing the symbol of their legion.  These banners are not merely ceremonial, as paladins of this oath can use them both as weapons and as a conduit for their divine magic, inspiring their allies to push through otherwise insurmountable odds.

#### Tenets of the Legion
The tenets of the Oath of the Legion vary from one legion to another, as groups can have wildly differing sets of moralities.  However, they are all committed to those they fight along side and the ideals that bind them.

**Inspiration.** You are a beacon of your legion and everything it stands for.  Inspire those ideals in your comrades

**Lead by Example.** As one who carries the symbol of your legion, you must strive to live by the ideals it stands for

**Never Give Up, Never Surrender.** No battle is lost, so long as your legion's banner still stands

**Glory** Seek out any opportunities to glorify and advance the cause of your legion


#### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

#### War Banner
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you can turn a glaive, halberd, pike, spear, quarterstaff or trident into a war banner you share a magical bond with.  During the course of a short rest, you can spend 1 hour to create this special weapon.  You can only have one war banner at a time, and if you create a new war banner, your bond with the previous one is broken.

The banner still maintains all the functionality of the original weapon, but you can use a free action to plant it into the ground or pick it up.  You can also use an action or one weapon attack to throw and plant it in any unoccupied 5 foot space within 30 feet of you that you have a clear aim at.

You may throw your banner this way as part of any of your Channel Divinity options, in which case the origin point of the ability is your banner, rather than you.

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity Options

**Banner of Assault.** As an action, you may wave your banner, calling for an all out attack.  Until the start of your next turn, you and all allies within 30ft. of you that can see your banner may use a bonus action to move up to their move speed towards it without provoking attacks of opportunity.  They must end this movement closer to the banner than they started.  They may make a single weapon attack during this bonus action.

**Enduring Emblem.** As a bonus action, you may wave your banner, inspiring new levels of determination amongst your allies.  All allies within 30 feet of you who are suffering from a condition they will be able to make a save against at the end of their up coming turn, may immediately make a save against that condition, ending it on a success.  If they fail this save, they can still attempt to do so again at the end of their next turn.

#### Banner Magic
At 7th level, any paladin spell you cast with a range of self and a radius, extends out from the banner as well as from you. 

Additionally, all auras gained as paladin features extend out from your banner as well as yourself.

#### Victory Smite
Starting at 15th level, if you are concentrating on a spell and you make a Divine Smite with your banner, you may end concentration on the spell and add damage to the smite as though you had expended a spell slot of an equivalent level to the spell you were concentrating on.

When you make a smite this way, you may smite as part of a thrown weapon attack.

#### Glorious Charge
Starting at 20th level, you may use an action to raise your banner high and call for a final push to victory.  As part of this action, you can throw your banner and you can cast one spell from your Oath of the Legion spell list without expending a spell slot or needing to maintain concentration on it.  You gain the following additional benefits for the next minute.

* All allies within 30 feet of you or your banner are under the effects of the spell *Heroism*
* All allies within 30 feet of you or the banner may make a shove action as a part of any melee weapon attack
* Whenever you would throw your banner, you may instead leap to the target location.  This can be done when activating Glorious Charge.
