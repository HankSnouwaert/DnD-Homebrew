## Artificer Specialist 

### Quantum Smith
Whether infusing objects with magic or altering the properties of other creatures, artificers are masters of controlling the physical properties of their surroundings.  Quantum smiths take this a step further by studying the fundamental particles that make up physical matter.  In doing so, they come to specialize in altering the spatial properties of themselves and other creatures.  
The pinnacle of this specialty is the quantum smiths' ability to alter the size of their own forms at will.  They can shrink down to the size of an ant or grow to the size of an elephant based on the needs of their situation.  Veteran quantum smiths can seamlessly shift sizes mid-fight and teleport themselves in and out of the fray, making them baffling foes in combat.

#### Tool Proficiency
*3rd level Quantum Smith Feature*<br>
You gain proficiency with your choice of smith's tools or alchemist's supplies.  If you already have these proficiencies, you gain proficiency with one other type of artisan's tool of your choice.

#### Quantum Smith Spells
*3rd level Quantum Smith Feature*<br>
You always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Quantum Smith Spells table.

These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

When you activate this ability, and as an action or <br> bonus action during its duration, you can shift <br> one or more size categories.  When you do so, <br> everything you are wearing and carrying changes <br> size with you, including your weapons. The sizes <br> you can reach are based on your artificer level, <br> and their effects on you are listed in the **Size <br> Effects** table below.  

For ever size category you increase, your size <br> doubles on all dimensions and your weight is <br> multiplied by eight.  For every size category you <br> decrease, you size is halved in all dimensions and <br> your weight is divided by eight.  The exceptions to  <br> this are the minuscule and quantum size categories. <br> At the minuscule size, you are roughly the size of a  <br> large ant. At the quantum size, you are so small you <br> appear to disappear entirely and can no longer <br> interact with the world around you.

After the full 10 minutes pass, you automatically <br> shift back to your natural size.

You can use this ability a number of times equal <br> to your Intelligence modifier + 1  (minimum 2) and <br> regain all uses when you complete a long rest.

#### Extra Attack
*5th level Quantum Smith Feature*<br>
You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take an Attack action on your turn.

#### Mercurial Transformation
*9th level Quantum Smith Feature*<br>
You can now change to any size other than gargantuan or quantum without using your Exponential Growth feature and can remain at that size indefinitely.  

Additionally, you can change to any size other than gargantuan or quantum as a reaction under the following circumstances:

* **When You Make a Melee Weapon Attack:**  If you grow at least two sizes and the attack is against a creature, you gain advantage on the attack.

* **When An Attack is Made Against You:**  If you shrink at least two sizes, you impose disadvantage on the attack.

* **When You Make a Strength or Dexterity Check:**  If this is an opposed Strength check, and you grow at least two sizes, the opposing creature suffers disadvantage the check.  If it is an opposed Dexterity check, and you shrink at least two sizes, the opposing creature suffers disadvantage on the check.

* **When You Make a Strength or Dexterity Save:** If this save is against an effect another creature is targeting you with, you gain advantage on a Strength saving throw if you grow at least two sizes, and you gain advantage on a Dexterity saving throw if you shrink at least two sizes.

* **At The End of Any Turn.**

#### Quantum Tunneling
*15th level Quantum Smith Feature*<br>
Your quantum expertise extends to altering the foundational equations of your very being. You gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.

Additionally, you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but you take 1d10 force damage for every 5 feet you move while inside another creature or object. If you end your turn inside a creature or an object, you are shunted into the nearest unoccupied space you last occupied.

### New Artificer Infusion

#### Quantum Coins
*Prerequisite: 6th-level artificer*<br>
*Item: A number of metallic coins less than or equal to your proficiency modifier*<br>
A creature with these coins can use each of them as a finesse thrown weapon with a range of 30/60.  When you are using them, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, for attack rolls with the coins.  

When a creature throws the coin, that creature chooses a size from the Quantum Coin Sizes table.  If the thrown coin hits a creature or object, its size changes to the chosen size category for the next 10 minutes, and it gains the traits associated with that size, described in the Quantum Coin Sizes table.  An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid changing size.  If it fails, it can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

Once a coin has been used to change the size of a target, it loses the ability to do so again until the next dawn.
