## Ranger Archetype

### Sea Dog
These rangers are master fishermen, capable of netting and harpooning deadly prey.  They excel at capturing dangerous sea creatures but can also apply their skills against anything else unfortunate enough to draw their ire.  Once a creature is harpooned or netted by a sea dog, escape becomes painfully difficult as the ranger reels in its prey.

As their name implies, most sea dogs come from coastal or seafaring backgrounds, with many of them being career fishermen or sailors.  However, some specialize in freshwater hunting and prefer to stalk rivers and large lakes.  

Sea dogs are notorious for their tendency to obsess over specific beasts that have eluded their nets.  The more times the creature slips through their grasp, the more the sea dog fixates on capturing its quarry.  Epic nautical quests have arisen out of the fisherman's burning desire to hunt down particularly dangerous and elusive sea monsters. 


#### Sea Dog Magic
*3rd-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
You learn one or more additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Sea Dog Spells table.  These spells count as a ranger spell for you, but they don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

Additionally, your ranger spells that target a flat surface can target the surface of water, so long as the water's surface remains relatively calm.

##### Sea Dog Spells
| Ranger  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  3rd          | Snare  |
|  5th          | Earthbind  |
|  9th          | Water Walk  | 
|  13th         | Grasping Vine     |
|  17th          |  Maelstrom   |

#### Wisened Sailer
*3rd-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
You gain proficiency with your choice of cartographer's tools, navigator's tools or water vehicles, and you gain a swim speed equal to your move speed.

Additionally, whenever you make a skill check to interact with a body of water or an aquatic creature, if you have proficiency in that skill, you apply double your proficiency bonus to the check.

Finally, if you would apply your Dexterity modifier to your AC, you may apply your Wisdom modifier instead.

#### Combat Angler
*3rd-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
You treat harpoon spears, harpoon guns, and nets (described at the end of the document) as having the *light* property while you are only wielding those types of weapons.  When you hit with a net, you may tether your target the same way you tether with a harpoon.  The tether has the same DC to snap, AC to hit, and damage needed to break as the net it's attached to, and a creature that breaks free of the net is no longer bound by tether.

Additionally, your favored enemies have disadvantage on checks to escape from your nets or drag you using your tethers.

Finally, if a target creature is in water and you are out of the water, you have advantage on harpoon and net attacks against it and on opposed checks made to prevent it from dragging you by your tethers.

#### Rope Master
*7th-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
You now treat nets as having a range of 20/60 and you can net Huge creatures.  

Additionally, the nets you've used to restrain creatures and the tethers you have attached to creatures gain the following benefits.
* The DC of the check needed to break them increases by an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier.
* Their AC increases by an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier.
* The damage needed to break them increases by an amount equal to your ranger level.

#### Dogged Fisherman
*11th-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
When a creature escapes from the tether of your net or harpoon you gain the following benefits.
* You can treat it as a favored enemy, if you do not do so already.
* You have advantage on Investigation, Survival, and Perception checks made to find or track it.
* Your harpoon and net attacks against it are made with advantage.

This effect ends when the target creature is reduced to 0 hit points or when you tether another creature with a net or harpoon attack.

#### Leviathan Hunter
*15th-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
When a creature attempts to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape your nets or tethers, it must first make Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can use that magic to escape. On a failure, the creature canâ€™t escape and wastes the use of the spell or effect. 

Additionally, whenever you hit a creature restrained or tethered with one or your nets or harpoons with a weapon attack, you deal additional damage equal to a roll of its hit dice

> ##### Variant Rangers & Favored Enemy
> If you are using the standard PHB ranger, Dogged Fisherman does not grant you languages as the Favored Enemy feature would. <br> If you are using variant ranger rules which replace the Favored Enemy feature with an ability that marks specific targets, use the effects of that feature in place of Favored Enemy for any Sea Dog abilities that refer to Favored Enemy. <br> The effect from Dogged Fisherman does not require concentration, even if your variant Favored Enemy feature normally would.

## Harpoons
The following content can be used to <br> add harpoon weaponry to your game <br> world.  The Harpoon Master feat can help <br> players specialize in using these weapons, <br> and the statistics for the Rope Qualities can <br> be used to upgrade the reliability of harpoon <br> tethers and net weapons.

### Harpoon Weapons

##### Harpoon Gun
*Martial ranged weapon, cost: 90gp, ammunition cost: 2gp*<br>
*1d6 piercing*, *ammunition (range 30/120), loading, special* <br>

##### Harpoon Spear
*Martial melee weapon, cost: 2gp*<br>
*1d6 piercing*, *special, thrown (20/60), versatile (1d8)*<br><br>

**Harpoons.** You can choose to tether yourself with a rope to a creature or object you hit with the harpoon. If you are using a harpoon gun, you must hold onto the gun to maintain this tether, and if you are using a spear, you must have a free hand to maintain this tether. You cannot maintain multiple tethers in one hand. You can drag tethered objects using the rope or pull tethered creatures towards you as though you are grappling them. 

Any creature within 5 feet of the target can use an action to remove the harpoon.  Doing so deals an additional 1d6 weapon damage to the target.

A tethered creature that attempts to move away from you must succeed an opposed Strength check against you.  If it succeeds, it drags you in the direction it moves.  If both of you roll a 10 or higher on this check, the tether snaps.  Dealing 5 slashing damage to the tether (AC 10) also snaps it.

If you recover a harpoon spear or a harpoon gun bolt with a snapped rope, you can replace the rope over the course of 10 minutes, using 1gp worth of rope and other supplies.  This can be done over the course of a short or long rest.

### New Feat: Harpoon Master
You've learned how to use harpoons to maximum effect in combat. 
When you take this feat, you gain the following benefits.
* Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Creatures you've hit with harpoons have their speed reduced by 15 feet until they've removed the harpoon.
* If a creature is concentrating on spell and ends its turn while impaled by a harpoon you hit it with, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

### Rope Quality for Nets & Harpoons

By paying more gold, players can gain access to higher quality rope for nets and harpoon tethers.  The following table describes the gp cost for each level of quality.  Each row of the table can be used to describe a net, or the rope and supplies need to attach a tether to a harpoon.  In the case of nets, the gp cost describes the overall cost of the net.  In the case of harpoon spears and harpoon gun bolts, the gp cost describes the added cost of upgrading the quality of the item, which can also be done when replacing a snapped tether.  

##### Rope Qualities 
|Cost  | Break DC  | Rope AC | Damage to Cut |
|:---:|:----:|:--:|:--:|
| 1gp |  10  | 10 | 5
| 10gp|  15  | 14 | 20
| 50gp|  20  | 18 | 50
