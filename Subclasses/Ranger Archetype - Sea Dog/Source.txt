## Ranger Archetype

### Sea Dog
These rangers are master fishermen, capable of netting and harpooning deadly prey.  They excel at capturing dangerous sea creatures but can also apply their skills against anything else unfortunate enough to draw their ire.  Once a target is harpooned or netted by a sea dog, escape becomes painfully difficult as the ranger reels in its prey.

As their name implies, most sea dogs come from coastal or seafaring backgrounds, with many being career fishermen or sailors.  However, some specialize in freshwater hunting and prefer to stalk rivers and large lakes.  

Sea dogs are notorious for obsessing over specific beasts that have eluded their nets.  The more times the creature slips through their grasp, the more the sea dog fixates on capturing its quarry.  Epic nautical quests have arisen out of the fisherman's burning desire to hunt down particularly dangerous and elusive sea monsters. 


#### Sea Dog Magic
*3rd-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
You learn one or more additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Sea Dog Spells table.  These spells count as a ranger spell for you, but they don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

Additionally, your ranger spells that target a flat surface can target the surface of water, so long as the surface remains relatively calm. Running water does not impede *locate creature* for you, and you can use it to sense creatures in the same body of water as you up to a mile away.

##### Sea Dog Spells
| Ranger  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  3rd          | *snare***  |
|  5th          | *earthbind**  |
|  9th          | *water walk*  | 
|  13th         | *locate creature*     |
|  17th          |  *maelstrom**   |

#### Wisened Sailer
*3rd-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
You gain proficiency with your choice of cartographer's tools, navigator's tools or water vehicles, and you gain a swim speed equal to your move speed.

Additionally, whenever you make a skill check to interact with a body of water or an aquatic creature, if you have proficiency in that skill, you apply double your proficiency bonus to the check.

Finally, if you would apply your Dexterity modifier to the AC granted by armor, you may apply your Wisdom modifier instead.

#### Combat Angler
*3rd-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
You're skilled at overcoming dangerous quarry with nets and harpoons, granting you the following benefits:

* You treat harpoon weapons (described at the end of the document) as having the *light* property while only wielding those weapons or nets, and when you make an attack with a harpoon weapon in one hand, you can use a bonus action to make a net attack with the other hand.
* When you hit a creature with a net, you may tether your target the same way you tether with a harpoon. The tether has the same DC to snap, AC to hit, and damage needed to break as the net it's attached to, and a creature that breaks free of the net is no longer bound by the tether.
* Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls with nets against it if it is your favored enemy.
* Your favored enemies have disadvantage on opposed Strength checks made to drag you or avoid being dragged by the tethers of your harpoons and nets.
* If a target creature is in water and you are out of the water, you have advantage on attacks with harpoons and nets against it and on opposed checks made to prevent it from dragging you by your tethers.

#### Rope Master
*7th-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
You can now net Huge creatures, and the nets you use to restrain creatures and the tethers you have attached to creatures gain the following benefits.
* The DC of the check needed to break them increases by an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier.
* Their AC increases by an amount equal to your Wisdom modifier.
* The damage needed to break them increases by an amount equal to half your ranger level (rounded up).

#### Dogged Fisherman
*11th-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
When a creature escapes from the tether of your net or harpoon you gain the following benefits.
* You can treat it as a favored enemy, if you do not do so already.
* You have advantage on Investigation, Survival, and Perception checks made to find or track it.

This effect ends when the target creature is reduced to 0 hit points or when you tether another creature with a net or harpoon attack.

#### Leviathan Hunter
*15th-level Sea Dog Feature*<br>
When a creature attempts to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape your nets or tethers, it must first make Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, the creature can use that magic to escape. On a failure, the creature canâ€™t escape and wastes the use of the spell or effect. 

Additionally, whenever you hit a creature restrained or tethered with one or your nets or harpoons with a weapon attack, you deal additional damage equal to a roll of its hit dice

<br>

> ##### Variant Rangers & Favored Enemy
> If you are using the standard PHB ranger, Dogged Fisherman does not grant you languages as the Favored Enemy feature would. <br> If you are using variant ranger rules which replace the Favored Enemy feature with an ability that marks specific targets, use the effects of that feature in place of Favored Enemy for any Sea Dog abilities that refer to Favored Enemy. <br> The effect from Dogged Fisherman does not require concentration, even if your variant Favored Enemy feature normally would.

## Harpoons
The following content can be used to <br> add harpoon weaponry to your game <br> world.  The Harpoon Master feat can help <br> players specialize in using these weapons, <br> and the statistics for the Rope Qualities can <br> be used to upgrade the reliability of harpoon <br> tethers and net weapons.

### Harpoon Weapons

##### Harpoon Gun
*Martial ranged weapon, cost: 90gp, ammunition cost: 2gp*<br>
*1d6 piercing*, *ammunition (range 30/120), loading, special* <br>

##### Harpoon Spear
*Martial melee weapon, cost: 2gp*<br>
*1d6 piercing*, *special, thrown (20/60), versatile (1d8)*<br><br>

**Harpoons.** You can choose to tether yourself with a rope to a creature or object you hit with the harpoon.  If you are using a harpoon gun, you must hold onto the gun to maintain this tether, and if you are using a spear, you must have a free hand to maintain this tether.  You cannot maintain multiple tethers in one hand. 

Once per turn, you can make an opposed Strength check against a creature you have tethered (no action required).  On a success, you can pull the tethered creature towards you as though you are grappling it.  A tethered creature can attempt to do the same to you on its turn, though if you fail the opposed Strength check, you can choose to drop the tether rather than be dragged by it.  Any time an opposed Strength check is made between you and a tethered creature, if both of you roll a 10 or higher on this check, the tether snaps. 

Any creature within 5 feet of a tethered creature (including the tethered creature) can use an action to remove the harpoon.  Doing so deals an additional 1d6 weapon damage to the creature as the harpoon is removed.  Dealing 5 slashing damage to the tether (AC 10) also snaps it.

If you recover a harpoon spear or a harpoon gun bolt with a snapped rope, you can replace the rope over the course of 10 minutes, using 1gp worth of rope and other supplies.  This can be done over the course of a short or long rest.

### New Feat: Harpoon Master
You've learned how to use harpoons to maximum effect in combat. 
When you take this feat, you gain the following benefits.
* Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Creatures you've hit with harpoons have their speed reduced by 15 feet until they've removed the harpoon.
* If a creature is concentrating on spell and ends its turn while impaled by a harpoon you hit it with, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

### Rope Quality for Nets & Harpoons

By paying more gold, players can gain access to higher quality rope for nets and harpoon tethers.  The following table describes the gp cost for each level of quality.  Each row of the table can be used to describe a net, or the rope and supplies need to attach a tether to a harpoon.  In the case of nets, the gp cost describes the overall cost of the net.  In the case of harpoon spears and harpoon gun bolts, the gp cost describes the added cost of upgrading the quality of the item, which can also be done when replacing a snapped tether.  

##### Rope Qualities 
|Cost  | Break DC  | Rope AC | Cumulative Damage to Cut |
|:---:|:----:|:--:|:--:|
| 1gp |  10  | 10 | 5
| 50gp|  13  | 13 | 10
| 200gp|  16  | 16 | 15
