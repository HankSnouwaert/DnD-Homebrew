## Druid Circle
 Druids of the circle of plagues bond with the countless diseases and maladies brought about by nature.  While other druids may disavow the pestilent afflictions which arise from the natural world, these plague druids revere them.  They view the squeamishness of other druids as a sign of weakness and naivete, for to truly embrace nature is to accept every life form, even horrid diseases.

Plague druids excel at infecting creatures with a variety of ever-evolving diseases.  While these afflictions can quickly bring their enemies low, those lucky enough to earn the druid's favor will find themselves enhanced by their infections.  Just as diseases quickly adapt to better spread amongst their victims, these druids constantly adapt and evolve their plagues to suit their situation.  

#### Circle Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You have an innate connection to the pestilent aspects of nature. This connection grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Plagues Spells table.
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Bane, Miasma of Pestilence, Chill Touch |
|  3rd          | Blindness/Deafness, Stream of Corruption|
|  5th          | Puddle of Ooze, Stinking Cloud      | 
|  7th          | Blight, Inflict Rot|
|  9th          | Contagion, Cloudkill|

#### Produce Pathogen
*2nd Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You can summon a specialized disease strain to bolster allies and wither enemies.  As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to attempt to infect a creature within 5 feet of you, including yourself.  It must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail.  On a failure, it is infected with a disease with one symptom of your choice.  Whenever a creature is infected by one of your diseases, you can choose to make it a Symbiotic Host rather than a Victim, in which case it gains positive effects from the disease.  The symptoms for Victims and Symbiotic Hosts are described in the Disease Symptoms section at the end of this document.  

At the start of each of your turns, all infected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, which they can choose to fail.  On a successful save, creatures end the disease on themselves.  

After these saves are made, every creature that's still infected spreads its disease to another uninfected creature within 5 feet of it.  This uninfected creature must make the same saving throw or become infected with the same disease.  If there are more than one uninfected creatures within 5 feet of an infected creature, you may choose which of the creatures becomes infected if you can see it.  Otherwise, DM chooses one at random.

A creature can only be infected by the disease once and can't become infected by it again until you use this ability again.

When you use this feature again, all other diseases created by this feature end.

#### Unnatural Immunity
*6th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You have resistance to necrotic damage and may also choose to automatically succeed any saving throws you make against diseases.

#### Evolving Epidemic
*6th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You've learned how to mutate your diseases to better suit them to any given situation.  When you use your Produce Pathogen feature, you may alter it with one of the following traits:

***Air Born.*** An infected creature can now spread the disease to another uninfected creature within 30 feet of it.

***Plague Missile.*** When you use Produce Pathogen, you can infect a creature up to 120 feet away from you rather than 5 feet from you.

***Pestilent Hex.***  The disease is no longer able to spread beyond the initial target.  You may choose to have the target suffer from two different Symptoms of your choice.  The creature also has disadvantage on the saving throw against becoming infected.

***Super Spreader.*** An infected creature now spreads the disease to each creature within 5 feet of it rather than just one.

#### Paroxysm
*10th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
When a creature that is not a symbiotic host for a disease fails its saving throw at the end of its turn against that disease, it suffers from the disease's severe symptom effects until the disease ends.  These severe symptoms do not replace the original symptoms unless stated otherwise.


#### Plague Shape
*14th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
When you use your Produce Pathogen feature against a creature that fails its saving throw against the disease, you may transform into the very disease you are infecting it with, causing you to disappear into the infected creature.  While inside the infected creature, you use the creature's senses and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that target diseases.

Additionally, you can't concentrate on spells unless they are from your Circle of Plagues Spell List, and you can't interact with the outside world in any way other than by casting spells from your Circle of Plagues Spell List.  Spells cast this way don't require components and are treated as though you are occupying the infected creature's space.  

Creatures you are infecting in this form have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells unless they are symbiotic hosts, in which case they automatically succeed.  Symbiotic hosts you are infecting take no damage from your spells if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

If you attempt to spread your disease from the creature you're inhabiting to one or more creatures, you may impose disadvantage on the saving throw one of those creatures makes to avoid becoming infected.  If it fails its saving throw and becomes infected, you move from your current host to this new creature as part of the infection.  This does not end the disease affecting the previous creature.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This form ends if your host creature dies, the disease affecting it ends, or you use your bonus action to return to your normal form.  Additionally, the host creature can use its action to make a Charisma check against your spell save DC, ending this effect on a success, though this does not end the disease affecting it.  When the effect ends, you reappear in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.  

### Disease Symptoms
The following disease symptoms are presented in alphabetical order.

#### Delirium
&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** Attack rolls have advantage against the infected creature as long as there are three or more creatures within 5 feet of it.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** Attack rolls have disadvantage against the symbiotic host as long as there are three or more creatures within 5 feet of it.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** The infected creature suffers the effects of the *enemies abound* spell.

> ##### Describing Symptoms
> The names of the symptoms listed here are meant to provide simple and easily recognizable descriptions of what's happening to the infected creature.  However, you can come up with your own descriptions to fit the symptom's effects.  For example, the continual damage dealt by the Fever symptom could instead be described as being caused by flesh-eating bacteria, and the effects of Nausea could instead be caused by muscle spasms. 

#### Fever
&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** At the start of the infected creature's turn, it takes necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your druid level (rounded up).

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** When a symbiotic host is infected by this disease, it gains temporary hit points Wisdom modifier + half your druid level (rounded up).  These temporary hit points last until the disease ends.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** At the start of the infected creature's turn, it takes necrotic damage equal to your Wisdom modifier + twice your druid level.  This replaces the damage dealt by the initial effect.

#### Mind Fire 
&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** Whenever the infected creature makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses its Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** Whenever the symbiotic host makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses its Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier, it may roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** Whenever the infected creature casts a spell of first level or higher, it takes 1d12 psychic damage per level of the spell.

#### Nausea
&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** Whenever the infected creature makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses its Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength modifier, it must roll a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** Whenever the symbiotic host makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw that uses its Constitution, Dexterity, or Strength modifier, it may roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

#### Fatigue

&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** The infected creature's speed is reduced by 10 feet.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.***  The symbiotic host's speed is increased by 10 feet.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** The infected creature's speed is halved, it can't use reactions, and on its turn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both.

#### Weeping Eyes

&emsp; ***Victim Effects.*** The infected creature is unable to see anything farther than 30 feet away from it.

***Symbiotic Host Effects.*** The symbiotic host gains blindsight out to a range of 10 feet. If it already has blindsight, its range increases by 10 feet.

***Severe Victim Effects.*** The infected creature is blinded.
