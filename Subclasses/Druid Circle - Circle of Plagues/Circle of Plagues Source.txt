#### Circle Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You have an innate connection to diseases and other toxic aspects of nature. This connection grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Plagues Spells table.
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.
