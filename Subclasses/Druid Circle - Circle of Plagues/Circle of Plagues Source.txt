## Druid Circle

#### Circle Spells
*2nd Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You have an innate connection to the pestilent aspects of nature. This connection grants you access to some spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Circle of Plagues Spells table.
Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the Druid Spell List, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

| Druid  Level  |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Bane, Miasma of Pestilence, Chill Touch |
|  3rd          | Blindness/Deafness, Stream of Corruption|
|  5th          | Puddle of Ooze, Stinking Cloud      |

#### Produce Pathogen
*2nd Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You can summon a specialized disease strain to bolster allies and wither enemies.  As a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to attempt to infect a creature within 5 feet of you, including yourself.  It must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail.  On a failure, it is infected with a disease with one symptom of your choice.  Whenever a creature is infected by one of your diseases, you can choose to make it a symbiotic host, in which case it gains positive effects from the disease.  The symptoms are described at the end of this document.  

At the end of each of your turns, any infected creatures spread their disease to another uninfected creature within 5 feet.  This uninfected creature must make the same saving throw or become infected with the same disease.  If there are more than one uninfected creatures within 5 feet of an infected creature, you may choose which of the creatures becomes infected if you can see it.  Otherwise, DM chooses one at random.

Infected creatures must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of their turns against your spell save DC, which they can choose to fail.  On a successful save, creatures end the disease on themselves.  

A creature can only be infected by the disease once and can't become infected by it again until you use this ability again.

When you use this feature again, all other diseases created by this feature end.

#### Unnatural Immunity
*6th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You have resistance to necrotic damage and may also choose to automatically succeed any saving throws you make against diseases.

#### Evolving Epidemic
*6th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
You've learned how to mutate your diseases to better suit them to any given situation.  When you use your Produce Pathogen feature, you may alter it with one of the following traits:

***Air Born.*** An infected creature can now spread the disease to another uninfected creature within 15 feet of it.

***Plague Missile.*** When you use Produce Pathogen, you can infect a creature up to 100 feet away from you rather than 5 feet from you.

***Pestilent Hex.***  The disease is no longer able to spread beyond the initial target.  You may choose to have the target suffer from two different Symptoms of your choice.  The creature also has disadvantage on the saving throw against becoming infected.

***Super Spreader.*** An infected creature now spreads the disease to each creature within 5 feet of it rather than just one.



#### Paroxysm
*10th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
When a creature that is not a symbiotic host for a disease fails its saving throw at the end of its turn against that disease, it suffers from the disease's severe symptom until the disease ends.


#### Plague Shape
*14th Level Circle of Plagues Feature*<br>
When you use your Produce Pathogen feature against a creature that fails its saving throw against the disease, you may transform into the very disease you are infecting it with, causing you to disappear into the infected creature.  While inside the infected creature, you use the creature's senses and can't be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that target diseases.

Additionally, you can't concentrate on spells unless they are from your Circle of Plagues Spell List, and you can't interact with the outside world in any way other than by casting spells from your Circle of Plagues Spell List.  Spells cast this way don't require components and are treated as though you are occupying the infected creature's space.  

Creatures you are infecting in this form have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells unless they are symbiotic hosts, in which case they automatically succeed.  Symbiotic hosts you are infecting take no damage from your spells if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.

If you attempt to spread your disease from the creature you're inhabiting to one or more creatures, you may impose disadvantage on the saving throw one of those creatures makes to avoid becoming infected.  If it fails its saving throw and becomes infected, you may move from your current host to this new creature as part of the infection.  This does not end the disease affecting the previous creature.

This form ends if your host creature dies, the disease affecting it ends, or you use your bonus action to return to your normal form.  Additionally, the host creature can use its action to make a Charisma check against your spell save DC, ending this effect on a success, though this does not end the disease affecting it.  When the effect ends, you reappear in the nearest unoccupied space of your choice.
