## Ranger Archetype

### Falconer
These rangers are renowned for their deadly skill in mounted combat and archery.  They weave in and out of battle atop their steed while unleashing volleys of arrows upon their comparably sluggish foes.  Steppe riders earn their name from the harsh plains where they are raised, and many of them travel to distant lands to serve in mercenary bands or brutal conquering armies.
