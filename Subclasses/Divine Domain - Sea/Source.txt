## Divine Domain

### Sea
Gods of the sea such as Umberlee, Zeboim, Deep Sashelas, Manannan mac Lir, Aegir, and Posidon are feared and beloved by their worshippers.  Their domains are central to coastal and maritime civilizations, and they can be a source of bountiful life and prosperity.  But these gods are fickle, and just as the sea can bring bounty one day, it can bring death and destruction the next.  Nearly all sailors have an ocean deity they pray to for safe passage on their voyages, and displeasing such a god can result in a one-way trip to the bottom of the sea.   
Clerics of this domain receive similar fear and reverence.  The divine waters they conjure can bring life to their allies and crushing death to their foes.  In combat, these clerics gather power like a rising tide, elevating those who earn their favor and drowning out the rest.

#### Domain Spells
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
You gain the domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Sea Domain Spells table.  See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

##### Sea Domain Spells
| Cleric  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1st          | *arms of hadar*, *create or destroy water*|
|  3rd          | *TBD*, *TBD* |
|  5th          | *tidal wave*, *wall of water*      | 
|  7th          | *control water*, *watery sphere*       |
|  9th          | *maelstrom*, *TBD*     |

#### Aquatic Initiate
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
You learn the *control water* cantrip. It counts as cleric cantrip for you, but doesâ€™t count against your number of cantrips known.  Additionally, you gain a swim speed equal to your move speed.  If you already have a swim speed, it is increased by 10 feet.

#### Ebb and Flow
*1st level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
The sea both giveth and taketh away.  The depth of your sacred connection to this domain is represented by a pool of d4s, referred to as your Ebb and Flow pool.  This pool grows like the tides as your divine powers ebb and flow between the destructive and restorative aspects of the sea.  At any given time, you are in one of two states: Ebb or Flow.  You can choose which state you are in when you gain this feature and whenever you complete a short or long rest.  Otherwise, you can enter each of these states under the following conditions:

**Ebb:** Whenever you cast one of your Aquatic Domain spells, you enter the Ebb state.

**Flow:** Whenever you cast a cleric spell of first level or higher level that restores hit points to a creature or cures it of a negative status condition, you enter the Flow state.

Whenever you switch states, add a d4 to your Ebb and Flow pool.  If you end your turn without having switched states this turn, you lose a d4 from this pool.

While you have dice in this pool, whenever you cast a Cleric spell of first level or higher that deals damage or restores hit points, roll all the dice in your pool and add the result to any healing or damage done to a single creature of your choice affected by the spell.  Doing this does not empty the dice pool.

#### Channel Divinity: Watery Domain
*2nd level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to switch to either the Ebb or Flow state while also calling forth the waters of your god's domain at a point you can see within 60 feet of you.  The summoned waters take the shape of a circular body of 10-foot deep water with a radius of 10 feet.  Alternatively, you can target an existing cylindrical area of water you can see with a radius of up to 20 feet and a depth of up to 20 feet to bring under the control of your god.  

This domain lasts for 1 minute, and the effect ends early if you are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you switch between the Ebb and Flow states while this effect is active, you can cause waves to erupt outwards from the center of the water.  Each creature in the body of water, or within 10 feet of it, must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail.  On a failure, the creature is healed a number of hit points equal to a roll of all the d4s in your Ebb and Flow pool, or it takes that much bludgeoning damage (your choice.) 

All creatures who failed their save are then pulled towards or pushed away from the center of the water (your choice) by 5 feet for every d4 you rolled.   The watery domain's radius then increases by 10 feet.

#### Rising Tide
*6th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
Whenever you cast a spell of first level or higher, if it is a higher level than any spells you've cast since the beginning of your last turn, you add a d4 to your Ebb and Flow dice pool.

#### Potent Spellcasting
*8th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
You now add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

#### Banished to the Deep 
*17th level Aquatic Domain Feature*<br>
If your Watery Domain feature is active, you may use an action to expend all the dice in your Ebb and Flow pool and roll them.  Each creature of your choice in the area of your Watery Domain must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to the result you rolled from your Ebb and Flow dice pool.  On a failure, the creature is pulled deep into the water and subjected to the *plane shift* spell, with the destination being your diety's home plane.  If no such plane exists, you can instead target a watery plane.  If a creature passes, you may instead have it pushed or pulled 5 feet away or towards the center of the domain for every Ebb and Flow die rolled.

## Other Aquatic Domains
Gods of other watery domains often serve similar roles to gods of the sea for landbound cultures.  These aquatic gods are all capable of providing life and sustenance but also feared for their association with the deadly hazards of watery environments.  
The following alternate class features can be used if your god is more closely aligned with rivers or swamps.  


### River Domain
Rivers are a precious source of food and fresh water, and civilizations in arid environments often view them as a sacred source of nourishment.  Rivers, and the gods associated with them, are also rightly feared, for rivers can quickly sweep away and drown the unwary.


#### Channel Divinity: Watery Domain
*2nd level River Domain Feature, which replaces the Sea Domain feature of the same name*<br>
As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to switch to either the Ebb or Flow state while also calling forth the waters of your god's domain at a point you can see within 60 feet of you.  The summoned waters take the shape of two 10 ft. deep by 10 ft. wide by 20ft. long stretches of water that must be contiguous with each other.  Alternatively, you may choose an existing contiguous area of water you can see that is up to 50 ft. long and 20 ft. deep to bring under the control of your god.  

When you create this domain, choose the direction it is flowing in.  Traveling against this current uses twice as much movement, and traveling with it uses half as much.  

This domain lasts for 1 minute, and the effect ends early if you are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

\columnbreak

Whenever you switch between the Ebb and Flow states while this effect is active, you can extend the river's length while causing the water to violently flow in the direction of your choice.  The river's length increases by 10 feet, and this extra length extends outwards from either end of the water in the direction of your choice.  Each creature in the body of water must then make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail.  On a failure, the creature is pulled downstream by 5 ft. for each d4 in your Ebb and Flow pool.  For every 5 ft. it is pulled, it either takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage or is healed for 2d4 hit points (your choice.)

#### Swept Away
*17th level River Domain Feature, which replaces Banished to the Deep*<br>
If your Watery Domain feature is active, you may use an action to expend all the dice in your Ebb and Flow pool and roll them.  Each creature of your choice in the area of your Watery Domain must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to the result you rolled from your Ebb and Flow dice pool.  On a failure, the creature is pulled deep into the water and subjected to the *plane shift* spell, with the destination being your diety's home plane.  If no such plane exists, you can instead target a watery plane.  If a creature passes, you may instead have it be carried 5 feet down the river for every Ebb and Flow die rolled.

### Swamp Domain
Swamps often carry sinister associations.  Home to diseases, foul monsters, and deadly hazards, most travelers steer clear of these environments.  However, some cultures settle in or around swamps, and the waters they provide are vital for crop growth.  Swamp deities can be associated with death and danger but often reign over domains of life and the harvest as well.

#### Domain Spells
*1st level Swamp Domain Feature, which replaces the Sea Domain feature of the same name*<br>
You gain the domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Swamp Domain Spells table.  See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

##### Swamp Domain Spells
| Cleric  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1st          |  *caustic brew*, *create or destroy water*|
|  3rd          | *acid arrow*, *mud ball** |
|  5th          | *puddle of ooze**, *wall of water*      | 
|  7th          | *control water*, *vitriolic sphere*       |
|  9th          | *acid rain**, *cloud kill*     |

#### Channel Divinity: Watery Domain
*2nd level Swamp Domain Feature, which replaces the Sea Domain feature of the same name*<br>

As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity feature to switch to either the Ebb or Flow state while also calling forth the waters of your god's domain at a point you can see within 60 feet of you.  The summoned waters take the shape of a circular body of muddy 5-foot deep water with a radius of 20 feet.  Alternatively, you can target an existing cylindrical area of water you can see with a radius of up to 30 feet that is no deeper than 10 feet to bring under the control of your god.  

\columnbreak

This domain lasts for 1 minute, and the effect ends early if you are incapacitated, die, or use this feature again.

Whenever you switch between the Ebb and Flow states while this effect is active, you can cause the domain's radius to increase by 5 feet.  Each creature in the domain must then make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, which it can choose to fail. On a failure, the creature is healed a number of hit points equal to a roll of all the d4s in your Ebb and Flow pool, or it takes that much necrotic damage (your choice.)  Creatures who took damage from this effect have their speed reduced by 5 feet for every d4 you rolled and are pulled to the bottom of the watery domain by gripping mud.  This effect lasts until the creature uses an action to free itself from the muddy restraints or leaves the body of water. 

#### Sucked into the Bog
*17th level Swamp Domain Feature, which replaces Banished to the Deep*<br>
If your Watery Domain feature is active, you may use an action to expend all the dice in your Ebb and Flow pool and roll them.  Each creature of your choice in the area of your Watery Domain must make a Strength saving throw with a DC equal to the result you rolled from your Ebb and Flow dice pool.  On a failure, the creature is pulled deep into the water and subjected to the *plane shift* spell, with the destination being your diety's home plane.  If no such plane exists, you can instead target a watery plane.  If a creature passes, you may instead have its move speed reduced by 5 feet for every die rolled, and it loses any fly speed it has.  This effect lasts until the creature uses an action to free itself from the muddy restraints or leaves the body of water.
