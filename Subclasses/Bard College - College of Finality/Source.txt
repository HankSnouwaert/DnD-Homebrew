In addition when you cast a bard spell that frightens one or more creatures, you may choose to have it so those creatures 
can't willingly move away from the source fear rather then not willingly being able to move closer to it until the end of your next turn.

#### Beauty in Death
Also at 3rd level, you can case your attacks to be fatal inspiration. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to deal an additional 2d4 damage to that target. You can do this only once per round on your turn. If reduce a creature to 0 hit points, you may choose a creature other than yourself within 60 feet of the hit creature that can see it to gain a Bardic Inspiration die.

This damage increases to 4d4 at 5th level, 8d4 at 10th level, 12d4 at 15th level.
