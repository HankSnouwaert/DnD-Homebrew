## Druid Circle

### Circle of the Arctic
Most druids of this circle make their homes in the coldest environments their world has to offer, and they have adapted all aspects of their druidic abilities to reflect this harsh environment.  They practice shapeshifting into arctic creatures while channeling the brutal nature of their boreal homes to unleash icy magics upon their enemies and can even summon and control enchanted glaciers with which to smite their foes.

#### Circle Spells
*2nd level Circle of the Arctic Feature*<br>
Your mystical connection to the arctic infuses you with the ability to cast certain spells.  Once you gain access to one of these spells, you always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.  If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you. 

##### Circle of the Artic Spells

#### Arctic Forms
*2nd level Circle of the Arctic Feature*<br>
You gain additional Wild Shape options at the druid levels listed in the Arctic Animal Forms Table.  See the Wild Shape class feature for information on how this feature works.  
The usual restrictions described in the Wild Shape feature regarding what types of creatures you can Wild Shape into do not apply to these forms.  While in these forms, you can perform the somatic and verbal components of druid spells from your Circle of the Arctic spell list.

##### Circle of the Arctic Wild Shape Forms

| Druid  Level  |  Wild Shape Option*      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  2nd          | Wolf, Reindeer |
|  6th          | Dire Wolf, Wolverine | 
|  12th         | Moose, Brown bear |
|  16th         |  Megaloceros, Grizzly bear |

*See end of the document for creature stat blocks

#### Arctic Dweller
*2nd level Circle of the Arctic Feature*<br>
You are well accustomed to frigid environments and can tolerate temperatures as low as -50 degrees Fahrenheit without additional Protection. If you wear heavy clothes, you can tolerate temperatures as low as -100 degrees Fahrenheit. Your movement is also unaffected by difficult terrain made of ice or snow.

Additionally, you gain resistance to cold damage.  If you already have resistance to cold damage from a racial feature, you instead gain advantage on Constitution saving throws against effects that would deal cold damage to you.

#### Glacial Summoning
*6th level Circle of the Arctic Feature*<br>
You've gained the ability to call forth icy manifestations of your boreal homelands.  You may use your action to summon a glacial mass of ice, causing it to burst from a location on the ground or on top of a liquid surface that you can see within 20 feet.  The ice can be up to 20 feet long on any side, and it must be summoned in an unoccupied space large enough to contain it.

The ice has an AC 14 and hit points equal to ten times your druid level.  It is immune to poison, psychic, cold damage, and vulnerable to fire damage.  If reduced to 0 hit points, it crumbles to mist.

The ice emanates a 15-foot aura of cold, and creatures other than you treat the space in this aura as difficult terrain.

As a bonus action, you can move the ice up to 20 feet along any solid or liquid surface.  If you move the ice into a creature, that creature must make the Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.  The creature takes 3d8 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

#### Avatar of the Arctic
*10th level Circle of the Arctic Feature*<br>
You can now use your Wild Shape feature to transform into a **tyrant polar bear**, **elasmotherium**, **fenrir wolf**, or **winter fury wolverine** for 1 hour.  You can wild shape this way 3 times and regain all uses of this feature after completing a long rest. 

#### Frozen Assault
*14th level Circle of the Arctic Feature*<br>
You can now channel the remorseless fury of the north through your attacks.  Whenever you deal 20 or more damage to a creature with a melee weapon attack or a spell that deals cold damage, the creature becomes bound by ice until the end of its next turn, or until it or another creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to break away the ice.  A creature bound by this ice has its speed reduced to 0.
