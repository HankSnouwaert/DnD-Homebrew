## Divine Domain 

### Destruction
Gods of destruction demand one thing of their followers: to bring about devastation wherever they tread. Gods of this domain include Shiva, Kali, Set, Tiamat, Gruumsh, The Devourer, and The Fury. Clerics of these gods are not only masters of destruction, but they also bring forth the full destructive potential of their allies. Woe be to any who stand in their path.

#### Domain Spells
*1st level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
You gain the domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Destruction Domain Spells table.  See the Divine Domain class feature for how domain spells work.

##### Destruction Domain Spells
| Cleric  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  1st          | *bane*, *chaos bolt** |
|  3rd          | *dust devil**, *shatter* |
|  5th          |  *erupting earth**, *melf's minute meteors**      | 
|  7th          | *blight*, *elemental bane**       |

#### Initiate of Destruction
*1st level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
You learn one evocation cantrip of your choice from the cleric, druid, or wizard spell lists. It counts as cleric cantrip for you, but does’t count against your number of cantrips known.

#### Gift of Ruin
*1st level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
You learn to augment the destructive capabilities of spells cast by you or your allies using a pool of energy represented by special dice called destruction dice.  These destruction dice are d12s, and you have a number of them equal to half your cleric level (rounded up).

When you or one of your allies within 100 feet of you rolls damage for a spell, you can use your reaction to spend a number of destruction dice equal to half your proficiency bonus or less. Roll the spent dice and add them to the spell's damage roll as any damage type the spell can produce.

You regain all expended destruction dice when you finish a long rest. Additionally, once per day, after completing a short rest, you may regain half your expended destruction die (rounded up).

#### Channel Divinity: Amid Disaster
*2nd level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
You can cause spells to break though defenses with ease while safe guarding your allies. When you or an allied creature you can see casts a spell, you may use your Channel Divinity to have that spell ignore damage resistances and deal double damage to structures and objects not being worn or carried. you can also choose any number of affected creatures who would normally take half damage on a successful save against the spell, they instead takes no damage on a successful save and half damage on a failed save. This effect does not continue beyond the turn the spell is cast.

#### Unstoppable Devastation
*6th level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
You can now push spells to reach their full, ruinous potential.  When you have rolled and add one or more destruction dice to a damage roll for a spell, you can choose a number of damage dice equal to the number of destruction dice added to the roll and treat those dice as though they rolled their maximum possible result. (You can choose destruction dice added to the roll.)

#### Potent Spellcasting
*8th level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
You add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

\columnbreak

#### Beseech the End
*17th level Destruction Domain feature*<br>
Your god teaches you the secrets of true apocalyptic power. You can use your bonus action to temporarily learn one spell of your choice from any class. The spell must be of a level you can cast, it must be in the school of conjuration, evocation, or necromancy, and it must deal damage immediately upon casting to a creature or target other than yourself. The chosen spell counts as a cleric spell for you but does not count against the number of cleric spells you know. You know the chosen spell until you finish a long rest.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

> ##### Beseeching for Wish
> Because the *wish* spell duplicates other spells rather than doing damage of its own, it cannot be cast using your Beseech the End feature.
