## Broken Oath

### Madness
Paladins regularly subject themselves to supernatural horrors that would shatter the psyche of most individuals.  It is only through intense training and dedication to their oaths that they are able to overcome the horrors of their quests.  

But not all paladins are able to preserve their oaths, or their minds.

For some paladins, the mental and emotional trauma of their quests prove too much, and their oaths are shattered along with the sanity.  Rushing into the void left behind by their sacred vows is a perverse divinity fueled by their madness.  Whereas most other adventurers would become catatonic from this level of trauma, these paladins channel their madness into a source of newfound power. 

Most of these paladins become depraved monsters, pursuing some grotesque parody of their former quest, or simply hunting innocents indiscriminately.  But some are still able to follow a shaky path towards some semblance heroism, turning their terrifying powers on evil doers as they struggle to retain some semblance of their former virtue. 

#### Broken Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.

##### Madness Spells
| Paladin  Level   |  Spells      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  3rd          | Dissonant Whispers, Cause Fear  |
|  5th          | Phantasmal Force, Mirror Image |
|  9th          | Fear, Major Image      | 
|  13th         | Phantasmal Killer, Confusion       |
|  17th         | Dominate Person, Synaptic Static     |

#### Channel Divinity
When you break your oath this way at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity Options

**Isolating Psychosis.** As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to issue words of madness that cause creatures to perceive only you for the next minute. You may choose a number of creatures equal to your proficiency modifier that you can see within 30 feet, and that are able to hear you and force them to make a Wisdom saving throw.  On a failed save, a creature is unable to see anything farther than 5 feet away from it other than you or the effects of spells and abilities originating from you for the next minute. 

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage from a source other then you, the creature can make another Wisdom saving throw. The creature has advantage on the saving throw if you are more than 30 feet away from it when it makes the save. On a success, the effect ends on the creature.

**Manifest Madness.**
At 3rd level, you can use a bonus action to magically create a visual illusion representing your inner madness in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of you. The illusion looks like an insane version of yourself and babbles maddeningly. It lasts for 1 minute, until you dismiss it as a bonus action, or until you're incapacitated.

Your illusion is unaffected by attacks and damage. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the illusion up to 30 feet. If your illusion is ever more than 60 feet from you at the end of a turn, it disappears.

* When you take the Attack action on your turn, any attack you make with that action can originate from your space or the illusion's space. You make this choice for each attack, but you must use your own senses. Any damage done by attacks made from the illusion this way is psychic damage.

* You can cast paladin spells from the illusion’s space, but you must use your own senses. 

* Creatures that are frightened of you are also frightened of your illusion.

* When your illusion is within 5 feet of a creature that can see it and hear it, that creature has disadvantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws and checks caused by your paladin spells, as it fills the creature’s mind with dread.

A creature can use an action to examine <br> the illusion with an Intelligence (Investigation) <br>or a Wisdom (Insight) check against your spell <br> save DC. If the check succeeds, the target ignores <br> all effects of the illusion.

#### Aura of Isolation
Starting at 7th level, you excel at preying upon isolated victims. Once per turn, you may gain advantage on a melee attack against creature that has no other allies within 5 feet of you.

Your illusions made from Manifest Madness gain this benefit as well.

#### Delirium Hunter
Starting at 15th level, when a creature within 120 feet of you that you can see or  hear fails on a saving throw against one of your Channel Divinity options or Oath spells, you may  use your reaction to move your self or the illusion made from Manifest Madness up to your move speed toward that creature. You must end this movement closer to the creature than you started. 
This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks, and if you are mounted on a creature created from *Find Steed* or a similar spell, your mount may use its reaction to move instead.

#### Living Nightmares
At 20th level, you may use your action to use your Isolating Psychosis ability without expending a use of Channel Divinity.  When you use Isolating Psychosis this way, you create an illusion of yourself for each creature targeted by the ability.  The illusions have all the properties described in the Manifest Madness feature with the following changes.

* When you use your bonus action to move one illusion, you may move them all.

* Once per turn, you can teleport to one of your illusions, swapping places with it.
 
* The range of your illusions is now 120 feet before they disappear.

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.
