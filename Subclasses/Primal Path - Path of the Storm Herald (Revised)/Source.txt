## Primal Path

### Path of the Storm Herald (Alternate)
All barbarians harbor a fury within . Their rage grants
them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians
who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn
to transform that rage into a mantle of primal magic,
which swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian
of this path taps into the forces of nature to create powerful
magical effects.
Storm heralds are typically elite champions who train
alongside druids, rangers, and others sworn to protect
nature. Other storm heralds hone their craft in lodges in
regions wracked by storms, in the frozen reaches at the
world ’s end, or deep in the hottest deserts.

#### Storm Aura
When you select this path at 3rd level, you emanate a stormy, magical aura while you rage. The aura extends 10 feet from you in every direction, but not through total cover.
When you adopt this path, you choose a environment type: desert, sea, or tundra. Your aura's effect depends on the chosen environment.

The aura lasts for the duration of your rage. At the end of each of your turns, each creature of your choice within it takes damage equal to your proficiency bonus.  The damage type is determined by your chosen environment. <br> <br>
**Desert.** Fire <br>
**Sea.** Lightning <br>
**Tundra.** Cold <br>

#### Storm Lash
Additionally, at 3rd level, whenever a creature enters or starts its turn within your aura, you can use your reaction to cause the storm to lash out at the creature with an effect determined by the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.  The save DC for the effect is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier.

**Desert.** You cause dust and sand and lash out at the creature, forcing it to make a dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes slashing damage equal to  1d4 + your strength modifier + rage damage.

**Sea.** Waves and wind crash out at a creature, forcing it to make a Strength saving throw.  On a failed save, it is moved up to 10 feet. 

**Tundra.** Frost slows the limbs of the creature, forcing it to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

#### Shielding Storm
At 6th level, your storm aura grants elemental protection and your connection to the storm grants you benefits even when your aura isn't active. The elemental protection and benefits are based on the environment you chose for your Storm Aura.
