## Sacred Oath

### Oath of the Paragon
Legends tell of Paladins that fight at the front of a legion, of
the valor they display and the inspiration it gives their
comrades. A Paragon before their army is a dauntless foe,
and an army behind their Paragon is an unstoppable legion.

A Paragon is not inherently good or evil. An evil legion can
be lead by a bold and charismatic Warlord just as effectively
as the forces of good.

As they tend to be those that inspire an organized force,
more often than not they will be lawful, but what that
personal code of laws entails can vary quite widely.

#### Tenets of the Paragon
The tenets of the Oath of the Paragon vary from one legion to another, as armies can have wildly differing sets of moralities.  However, they are all committed to those they fight along side.

**Teamwork.** No solider wins a war alone.  It is your duty to ensure your allies can overcome any challenge through their combined efforts.

**Greatness Through Example.** You strive to be the pinnacle of glory, so that others may be inspired to follow in your footsteps.

**Respect.** Any who strive for honor and greatness must be acknowledged for their efforts.

**Responsibility** All those who fight with you are under your care, and you must take that charge seriously

#### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity Options

**Lead the Charge.** When you roll initiative, you may use your Channel Divinity to grant yourself a bonus to the roll equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1), and temporary hit points equal to your paladin level.

**Rallying Mark.** When you strike an enemy with a melee weapon attack, you may use your Channel Divinity to mark the target for a coordinated assault from your allies.  Until the start of your next turn, each creature that rolls damage against the target deals extra damage equal to twice your charisma modifier and regains that many hit points.  

This effect can only occur once per creature and can occur a maximum number of times equal to you charisma modifier.

#### Exalted Warrior
Starting at 7th level, once per turn, when one of your allies
within 10 feet takes or deals damage, you gain d4 dice,
adding it to a pool of dice. You can have a maximum number
of d4 dice in this pool equal to your Charisma modifier
(minimum 1).
Until the end of your next turn, when you deal damage you
can expend any number of dice from this pool dealing
additional damage equal to the number of expended dice.

At 18th level, the range of this ability increases to 30 feet.

#### Stand Defiant
Starting at 15th level, you can use a bonus action to expend any number of the dice from the dice pool granted by Exalted Warrior and regain that much health. 

Once you use this ability, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.

#### Invincible Legion
At 20th level, you can become an avatar of battle, inspiring your allies to push beyond their limits.  As an action, you can become an avatar of battle for 1 minute and gain the following benifits.

* The d4s in the dice pool granted to you by Exalted Warrior become d8s
* If an allied creature within 60 feet of you is reduced to 0 hit points, but not killed outright, it can drop to 1 hit point instead so long as it can see of hear you.  The creature can only benefit from this once per use of this feature.
* If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.  You can only benefit from this once per use of this feature.
