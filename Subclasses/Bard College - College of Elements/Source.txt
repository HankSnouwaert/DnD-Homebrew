## Bard College

### College of Elements
Bards of this college train in magical techniques <br> not normally known to other bards: the manipulation <br> of primal elemental forces.  These bards see the primordial forces of lighting, fire, and ice how a painter views oils and a canvas.  They shape these elemental forces into dazzling and deadly displays.  The performances of these elemental bards are truly a visual special.  In combat, they weave through the fray, utilizing different elements to match the needs of any given situation, always doing so with artistic flair.

#### Elementalist's Palette
*3rd Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
You've learned to tap into elemental magics. When your spellcasting feature lets you learn a bard cantrip or a bard spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose the new spell from the sorcerer spell list or the bard spell list. You must otherwise obey all the restrictions for selecting the spell, and it becomes a bard spell for you.

You also learn the *chromatic orb* spell. It is a bard spell for you, but it doesn't count against your number of bard spells known, and you may cast it without material components.

Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma (Performance) check, if you have cast a conjuration or evocation spell of 1st level or higher since the beginning of your last turn, you can increase the result of the check by the level of the spell cast.

#### Kinetic Artistry
*3rd Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
You may use a bonus action to expend a use of your Bardic Inspiration to dash. When you take this bonus action, choose one of the following additional effects:

**Cold.** Icy water swirls around you. Until the end of your turn, you can move across the surface of water as if it were harmless solid ground. Additionally, when you leave a space within 5 feet of a creature, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. 

\columnbreak

<br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> 

On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A creature can be affected by the water only once each turn.

**Fire.** Flames wreath your steps. Once before the end of your turn, you can force each creature within 5 feet of you to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, a creature takes fire damage equal to a roll of the Bardic Inspiration die used + your Charisma modifier.

**Lightning.** You take on a nimble lightning form. Until the end of your turn, you can move through the space of other creatures, and you do not provoke opportunity attacks. If you end your turn inside a creature’s space, you are pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.

When you give a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, you can infuse it with cold, fire, or lightning. The creature can use the Bardic Inspiration die to dash as a bonus action and gain an additional effect based on which damage type it was infused with, as shown by the options above.

#### Creative Outburst
*6th Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
You and others you inspire are infused with even more magnificent elemental power.  When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher level that deals cold, fire, or lightning damage, you can use your Kinetic Artistry feature on yourself without expending a use of Bardic Inspiration.  The effect you gain matches the damage type of the spell.  If the spell can deal multiple types of damage, you can choose which one to use.

Additionally, a Bardic Inspiration die infused with cold, fire, or lightning from your Kinetic Artistry feature provides additional effects based on the elemental type it is infused with, as detailed below:

**Saving Throw.** Immediately after the creature rolls the Bardic Inspiration die and adds it to a saving throw, it gains resistance to the infused damage type until the end of the turn.

**Attack Roll.** If an attack with a Bardic Inspiration die added to its attack roll hits a creature, the creature takes additional damage of the infused damage equal to a roll of the Bardic Inspiration die used. The creature then suffers an additional effect based on the damage type:

* **Fire.**  The target takes additional fire damage equal to a roll the Bardic Inspiration die used.

* **Cold.**   The target’s speed is reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn, as it becomes encrusted with ice.

* **Lightning.** The target is unable to take reactions until the end of its next turn, as electricity courses through it.

#### Maelstrom Muse 
*14th Level College of Fire Dancing feature*<br>
The artistry of your elemental spells is an inspiration to others. When you cast a spell of 4th level or higher that deals cold, fire, or lighting, you can choose a creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can see the spell. That creature gains a Bardic Inspiration die infused with the same damage type as the spell. The size of the die depends on the level of the spell, as listed below.

| Spell Level  | Bardic Inspiration Dice Size |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  4  | d4 |
|  5  | d6 |
|  6  | d8 |
|  7  | d10 |
|  8 or 9| d12 |
