## Arcane Tradition

### School of Invention (Alternate)
The School of Invention claims credit for
inventing the other schools of magicâ€”a claim
other wizards find absurd. Wizards of this school
push magic to its limits. They stretch the known
laws of arcane power and strive to reveal
important truths about the nature of the
multiverse.

Adherents of this school believe that
innovation is best served through
experimentation. They have a reputation for
acting first, thinking second. Most wizards are
scholars who have mastered their craft through
careful study, rigorous practice, and endless
hours of repetition. These wizards would rather
throw spells together and see what happens.

Many wizards of this tradition are gnomes,
alchemists, or both, and they take pride in the
magic-infused apparatus they don. The apparatus is designed
to help the wizard channel magic in powerful, but
unpredictable ways.

Wizards of this tradition are regarded as
savants to their faces, but wizards of other
traditions often think of them as lunatics.


#### Arcane Apparatus
When you choose this arcane tradition at 2nd level, you gain proficiency with your choice of Tinker's Tools or Alchemy Supplies.  

Using your chosen tools, you learn how to make an arcane Apparatus.  This device consists of a metal gauntlet connected to a back mounted capacitor via various chords.  The Apparatus serves as an arcane focus while allowing you to keep both hands free.  If your Apparatus is lost or destroyed, you can use your chosen tools to spend 1 hour and 2gp worth a materials to construct a new one.  You can only benefit from one Apparatus at a time and only a creature from the School of Invention can use an Apparatus.

#### Explosive Innovation
Also starting at 2nd level, you learn two Innovations of your choice, detailed at the end of the document.  You must have your Apparatus equipped to use any of your Innovations.  Many Innovations enhance your spells as you cast them. You can only use one Innovation per spell cast.

The Innovation descriptions will require you to roll one or more Heat Die.  This represents your Apparatus building up heat as you push its limits.  To roll a Heat Die, roll a d6 and add the result to the Heat Level of your Apparatus.  

Your Apparatus starts with a Heat Level of 0 and has a maximum Heat Level equal to 6 + Half your Wizard Level (rounded up). If you end your turn without having rolled a Heat Die since the end of your last turn, your Apparatus's heat level decreases by 1.  

If your Apparatus's Heat Level exceeds its maximum, it overloads.  Reduce its Heat Level back to 0, cast the spell you were applying the Innovation to, and then roll on the Arcane Overload table to see what mishap befalls you. 

If an effect on the Arcane Overload calls for a saving throw, the DC equals 10 + your proficiency modifier.

#### Inventer's Insight
At 6th level, you learn an additional Innovation of your choice. 

Additionally, once per round, when you roll a Heat Die, you may chose to reduce or increase the result by 1.  This may increase the result to 7 or reduce it to 0.

#### Direct Current
At 10th level, you learn an additional Innovation of your choice.

Additionally, you may chose not to roll any Heat Die for a turn and use an Action to discharge your Apparatus.  When you use this action, roll 3d6 and reduce the Heat Level of the Apparatus by the result.  You may make a ranged spell attack against another creature within 60 feet as part of this action.  If the attack hits, the creature takes lightning damage equal to the result rolled.  

You may not use this action if you have rolled a Heat Die since the end of your last turn, and once you use this action, you can't use any Innovations until the start of your next turn.

At 17th level, the amount you roll becomes 4d6.

#### Epic Experiment
Beginning at 14th level, as an Action, Bonus Action, or Reaction, you can discharge all the heat from your Apparatus.  When you do this, you may cast any spell from your spell book that has a spell level equal to no more than half the Heat Level you discharged and a casting time equal to the type of action you used to discharge the Apparatus.  You must meet all other requirements for the casting of the spell.

Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until you complete a long rest.

#### Innovations
The innovations are presented in alphabetical order.

**Beacon Bolt.** When you make an attack roll with a Wizard spell, you may roll a Heat Dice. You may repeat this process until you overload or choose to stop. 

Once either happens, add the combined result to the attack roll. You can wait until after you make the attack roll before deciding to use this Innovation, but must decide before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.  If the spell attack succeeds, it deals half as much damage.

\pagebreak

**Cyclonic Rift.** Whenever you cast a Wizard spell of 1st level or higher that has a point in space as its target and forces creatures to make a saving throw, you may roll a Heat Dice. You may repeat this process until you overload or choose to stop.  Once either happens, each creature that fails against the spell's save on the turn it was cast is pulled a number of feet equal to the total Heat Dice result towards the center of the spell.

**Dynacharge.** When you roll damage for a spell, you may roll a Heat Dice.  You may then choose to replace one of the damage die results with the Heat Die result.  You may repeat this process until you overload or choose to stop.

**Focus Surge.** You may cast a spell requiring concentration and maintain concentration on it, even while concentrating on another spell.  Whenever you make a check to maintain concentration, one check is made for both spells.  

At the start of each of your turns, and whenever you take damage, roll a Heat Die. If you overload, you immediately lose concentration on both spells.

\columnbreak

**Ionize.** When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, you may roll a Heat Die.  You may repeat this process until you overload or choose to stop. 

Once either happens, You may choose one of the Heat Dice rolled and subtract its result from the result of the first saving throw made against the spell.  You can chose to use this Innovation after the creature makes its roll, but before the DM says whether the creature succeeded on its saving throw or not.

**Jump-Start.** When you make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell, you may chose to roll a Heat Die and add its result to the result of your saving throw.  If you still failed the save, you may repeat this process until you overload or chose to stop.

**Mazimize Velocity** Whenever you cast a Wizard spell of 1st level or higher that targets only you or one friendly creature, you roll a Heat Die.  You may repeat this process until you overload or choose to stop. 

Once either happens, you may choose one of the Heat Dice rolled and the target creature moves a number of feet equal to the total Heat Dice result times 5 in a direction of its choosing.
