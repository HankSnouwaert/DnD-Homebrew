# Items & Equipment

## Chaos Dwarf Weaponry
Chaos dwarves are known for their wicked ingenuity and have invented destructive firearms beyond the capabilities of most other races. The following firearm weapons are used by some of the chaos dwarf infantry described later and can be made available to players at the DM’s discretion. 

***Blunderbuss.*** Crafted in the dark forges of the chaos dwarves, blunderbusses are marvels of dark engineering, combining the dwarven knack for craftsmanship with cruel, destructive intent. Larger and more potent than the firearms wielded by their kin, these weapons are loaded with a lethal mix of shot, black powder, and arcane substances. When fired, they unleash devastating projectiles capable of decimating enemy ranks and piercing the strongest armor.

***Fire Glaive.*** These infernal weapons combine the melee capabilities of a traditional glaive with a rifle capable of shooting flaming projectiles. Fire glaives are rare and expensive to produce and, as such, are only used by the most elite chaos dwarf soldiers. Soldiers utilizing these weapons are able to act as hybrid warriors, alternating between melee and ranged combat depending on the needs of the battle.

#### Blunderbuss 1.0.0
*ranged weapon (martial)*
___
- **Damage:** 3d10
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Ammunition (range 80/320), reload (1), heavy, two-handed

- **Weight:** 18 lb.

___

### New Weapon Properties 
&emsp;**Fire Glaive.** This weapon can be used to make ranged attacks that use its ammunition property. Attacks made this way deal an additional 1d10 fire damage on hit.

**Reload (X).**  This weapon can be fired X times before it must be reloaded using an action or in place of an attack that's part of an attack action or in place of an off-hand attack while duel wielding. The weapon can be reloaded early without losing any ammunition.

## Rope Mechanics & Harpoons


### Tug of War Contests 0.0.0
A tug-of-war contest is a special type of opposed Strength check between two creatures on either end of a rope.

While you're holding or tethered to a rope that is also held by or tethered to another creature no more than one size larger than you, you can use the Attack action to make an opposed Strength check against the other creature to try to pull the rope towards yourself. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. 

If you are more than one size larger than the opposing creature, you automatically win this contest. If the results of both checks are higher than the rope's break DC, the rope snaps.

If you win the contest and the rope doesn't snap, you can pull the rope along with you as you move or pull it towards yourself while standing still. If the opposing creature doesn't drop the rope or is tethered to it, it will be pulled along as though you are grappling it. 

You can't engage in a tug-of-war contest using a hand that is holding other objects (including other ropes).

#### New Condition: Tethered 0.0.0
If a creature is attached to a rope (such as via a lasso, harpoon, or a secure tie), it is tethered to that rope. Creatures immune to the grappled condition can't be tethered. 

Any creature that succeeds in a tug-of-war contest against a tethered creature using the attached rope is considered to be grappling it. The tethered creature can end the grapple by untethering itself, breaking the rope, or winning another tug-of-war contest against the grappling creature.




### Harpoon Weapons 1.1.0

#### Harpoon Gun
*ranged weapon (martial, crossbow)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d6

- **Cost:** 90 gp, ammo: 2gp (1gp for the bolt, 1gp for the rope)
- **Weight:** 4 lb
___

#### Harpoon Spear
*melee weapon (martial, spear)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** harpoon, thrown (range 20/60), special, versatile (1d8)
- **Cost:** 2 gp (1gp for the spear, 1gp for the rope)
- **Weight:** 4 lb
___


\columnbreak

##### Harpoons

All harpoon spears and ammunition are attached to a harpoon rope. By default, harpoon ropes have 10 AC, a Break DC of 12, and can be cut with 5 damage.

**Tethering The Target.** When you hit a creature or object with a harpoon attack, it is tethered to the harpoon's rope. If you miss, the target isn't tethered, and you can use the rope to pull the harpoon back to yourself as an object interaction. 
When you tether a creature this way, you may immediately make a tug-of-war contest against it (no action required.)

**Removing The Harpoon.** Any creature that can reach the harpoon can use an action to remove it, thus ending the tethered condition. Doing so deals an additional 1d6 weapon damage to the tethered creature.

**Replacing Harpoon Ropes.** If you recover a harpoon spear or a harpoon gun bolt with a snapped rope, you can replace the rope over 10 minutes, using 1gp worth of rope and other supplies. This can be done over the course of a short or long rest, replacing up to 10 harpoon ropes during a short rest and up to 20 during a long rest.



### Feat: Harpoon Master 1.0.0
You've learned how to use harpoons to maximum effect in combat. 
When you take this feat, you gain the following benefits.
* Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Creatures you've hit with harpoons have their speed reduced by 15 feet until they've removed the harpoon.
* If a creature is concentrating on a spell and ends its turn while impaled by a harpoon you hit it with, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

### Rope Quality for Nets & Harpoons 1.0.0

Players can gain access to higher-quality rope for nets and harpoon tethers by paying more gold. The following table describes the gp cost for each level of quality. Each table row can be used to describe a net or the rope and supplies needed to attach a tether to a harpoon. In the case of nets, the gp cost describes the overall cost of the net. In the case of harpoon spears and gun bolts, the gp cost describes the added cost of upgrading the item's quality, which can also be done when replacing a snapped tether.  

##### Rope Qualities 
|Cost  | Break DC <br> (Harpoon) | Break DC <br> (Net)  | Rope AC | Cumulative <bR> Damage to Cut |
|:---:|:----:|:----:|:--:|:--:|
| 1gp | 12 | 10  | 10 | 5
| 50gp|  15 | 13  | 13 | 10
| 200gp| 18 | 16  | 16 | 15

\pagebreak


## Plague Censers

These insidious weapons have the appearance of a ceremonial censer used for burning incense, but they are shaped into the form of a flail.  Each day, a plague censor can be filled with toxic incense, and as the censor is swung in combat, it unleashes necrotic fumes deadly to all in the vicinity, including the wielder.    


#### Plague Censer 1.0.0
*melee weapon (martial, flail)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d8
- **Damage Type:** Bludgeoning
- **Properties:** Heavy, two-handed, reach, special
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___

***Plague Censor.*** When you make an attack with a plague censer, it releases its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.  Each creature in that area takes 1d6 necrotic damage, including the wielder.  Once a plague censer releases its putrid incense, it can't do so again until the next round.

The plague censer must be filled every 24 hours with 10gp worth of putrid incense to maintain this trait.



### Feat: Plague Censer Fanatic 1.0.0
You've learned how to develop a supernatural bond with a plague censor, drawing perverse fortitude from it even as you are withered by its toxic fumes, and you can use this bond as a focus for your magical abilities.   You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with plague censers.

*  As long as you are wielding a plague censer containing putrid incense, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and you can perform the somatic components of spells even when it is occupying both your hands.

* When you cast a spell that has somatic components using your plague censer as your spellcasting focus, you may have it release its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.

* When you release putrid incense from a plague censer you are wielding, you may have it deal 1d8 necrotic damage rather than 1d6.

* When you take necrotic damage from a plague censer you are wielding, you get +2 to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you stop wielding the plague censor in both hands.

## Poisoned Wind Globes

### Poisoned Wind Globe Items 2.0.0

#### Poisoned Wind Globes
___
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Poisoned wind globes are orbs made of glass or crystal and filled with deadly gas. When shattered, the spheres release billowing toxic clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.



#### Death Globes
___
- **Cost:** 100 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Death globes are built with the same function as poisoned wind globes, but the gasses they carry are far more potent and capable of enveloping a much larger area.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 30 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 10-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the globe, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the globe, and it detonates at your location.

\pagebreakNum

#### Poisoned Wind Globe & Death Globe Upgrades

These effects can be added to poisoned wind globes or death globes to enhance their lethality. The cost of the globe is increased by 100 gold per upgrade added. If they're added to the globes used ratfolk poisoned wind globadiers or ratfolk death globe bombardiers, their CR goes up by 1 per upgrade applied to their globes.

* **Acid Blast.** When the orb shatters at a point, each creature within 15 feet of the point must make the Dexterity saving throw against the orb's save DC. A creature takes 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. (This orb still releases its gas cloud as usual.)

* **Rot-Spice.** The clouds created by the orb deal necrotic damage when shattered instead of poison damage, and creatures poisoned by the gases gain a level of exhaustion.

* **Warp Razors.** When a creature moves into or within the cloud created by the orb, it takes 5 (2d4) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

### Feat: Poisoned Wind Fumigator 1.0.0
You've become a master of crafting and utilizing poisoned wind globes to maximum effect, and you can even implement globes with gases specialized in poisoning creatures normally resistant or immune to such effects. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kit, or glassblower's tools

* You may have the saving throw for a poisoned wind globe or death globe you throw become 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, and you may add your Intelligence modifier to the poison damage its gas cloud deals.

* At the end of each long rest, choose a creature type other than construct. Creatures of the chosen creature type don't benefit from resistance or immunity to poison damage from poisoned wind globes and death globes you throw unless they are under the effect of the *protection from poison* spell.

* If you are proficient with glassblowers tools and either alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kits, and you have them in hand, you can create a new poisoned wind globe from the remains of one that has shattered within the last hour. To do so, you must expend 25 gp worth of alchemist's supplies or poisons over the course of 1 minute to turn the shattered globe into a new poisoned wind globe.

A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice), freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. If a creature has multiple attacks with the Attack action, it can replace any number of them with these checks. The grapple also ends if you drop the things catcher.

## Throwing Stars

These small, sharpened metal stars can be thrown or used as a stabbing weapon to deal small amounts of damage and potentially deliver poisoned attacks.  Their small size and unassuming nature make them ideal concealed weapons.

***Throwing Star.*** You can use two-weapon fighting to make off-hand attacks with throwing stars as though they are melee weapons, and you can use throwing stars to make melee weapon attacks as though they are light melee weapons. However, you still have disadvantage on these attack rolls if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and isn't incapacitated. 

### Feat: Throwing Star Master 1.0.0

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with throwing stars.

* You can draw a throwing star as part of the attack you make with it.
