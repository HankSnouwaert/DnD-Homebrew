## Lucky Charm

Throughout the known world, members of nearly <br> every race and walk of life will carry keepsakes <br> they consider good luck.  Good luck charms come <br> in many forms, from odd articles of clothing to <br> bizarre  trinkets.  But the most common good luck <br> charms tend to be small  tokens and pieces of jewelry.  

Sometimes these items are actually infused with <br> magic that grants the wearer a stroke of good fortune <br> when needed most.  These items may have been <br> enchanted to bend the whims of fate, blessed by a <br> cosmic being, or simply be hand-me-down curios <br> that bring inexplicable luck to their wearers.  In any <br> case, many superstitious adventurers never set out <br> without their trusty lucky charms, which they swear <br> have turned many certain death encounters into near <br> misses.

#### Lucky Charm
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small charm can be attached to any piece of <br> jewelry or clothing.  While wearing it, whenever you <br> make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you <Br>may roll an additional d20.  You can use this ability after <Br> the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.  You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

If multiple creatures use a lucky charm or luck point granted by the Lucky feat on the same roll, they cancel out, resulting in no additional dice.

Once you use this feature, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn, and a creature that has used a lucky charm can't use another until it takes a long rest.
