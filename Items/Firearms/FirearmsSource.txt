# Firearms
The following is a list of new firearm weapons that can be added to your games at your DM's discretion. Firearms don't fit in all settings, and depending on the technology level in your setting, some or all of the weapons here may be limited in their availability. Alternatively, if blackpowder technology doesn't exist in your setting, they could be otherworldly items that can't be replicated, or their operation could be magical in nature.

## Firearm Weapon Properties 

&emsp; **Load(X)/Capacity(Y).** The weapon must be loaded with ammunition before it can be fired. Each piece of ammunition loaded into it must be done so using X Actions, or in place X attacks that are part of the Attack action or an off-hand weapon attack while duel-wielding. If X is less than 1, the weapon can be loaded with multiple pieces of ammunition at once (1/2 would be 2 at once, 1/3  would be 3 at once, etc.) 

The weapon can hold up to Y pieces of ammunition at a time.

**Rapid Fire.** If you take the Attack action on your turn while holding this weapon, you can make one additional attack with it as part of the same action. If you do, all attacks you make before the end of your turn must be made with this weapon. All attack rolls made this way are made with disadvantage, you automatically miss any attacks made at long range, and you can’t reload the weapon during this turn.

**Spread.** If you hit a creature with an attack roll using this weapon, you can make another attack roll with the weapon against a second creature within 5 feet of the first and within your weapon's range. On a hit, the second creature takes the weapon’s damage, but you don’t add your ability modifier to the damage unless that modifier is negative.


\columnbreak

&emsp;**Accurate.** Creatures proficient with this weapon gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with it. 

**Detonate.** When you hit or miss with an attack using this weapon, the target and each creature within a 10-foot radius of a point centered on the target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 Piercing damage.
If you roll a natural 1 on the attack roll, you and each creature within a 10-foot radius of a point centered on you must make the saving throw instead.

The saving throw DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier.

**Fire Glaive.** This weapon can be used to make ranged attacks using its Ammunition property. Attacks made this way deal 2d6 Piercing damage plus 2d6 Fire damage.
