## Harpoons 

### Harpoon Weapons

#### Harpoon Gun
*ranged weapon (martial, crossbow)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Ammunition (range 30/120), harpoon, loading, special
- **Cost:** 90 gp, ammo: 2gp (1gp for the bolt, 1gp for the rope)
- **Weight:** 4 lb
___

#### Harpoon Spear
*melee weapon (martial, spear)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d6
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** harpoon, thrown (range 20/60), special, versatile (1d8)
- **Cost:** 2 gp (1gp for the spear, 1gp for the rope)
- **Weight:** 4 lb
___


***Harpoons.*** You can choose to tether yourself with a rope to a creature or object you hit with the harpoon; otherwise, you can pull the harpoon back to yourself as an object interaction. A creature cannot be tethered if it immune to the grappled condition. If you choose to tether yourself, the hand you used to make the attack becomes occupied maintaining the tether. You cannot maintain multiple tethers in one hand, and creatures immune to the grappled condition cannot be tethered. 

Once per turn, you can make an opposed Strength check against a creature you have tethered (no action required). On a success, you can drag the tethered creature towards you. Doing so uses up 5 feet of movement for every 5 feet you drag it unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you. A tethered creature can attempt to do the same to you on its turn, though if you fail the opposed Strength check, you can choose to drop the tether rather than be dragged by it. Any time an opposed Strength check is made between you and a tethered creature, if both of you roll a 12 or higher on this check, the tether snaps. 

Any creature within 5 feet of a tethered creature (including the tethered creature) can use an action to remove the harpoon. Doing so deals an additional 1d6 weapon damage to the creature as the harpoon is removed. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the tether (AC 10) also snaps it.

If you recover a harpoon spear or a harpoon gun bolt with a snapped rope, you can replace the rope over 10 minutes, using 1gp worth of rope and other supplies. This can be done over the course of a short or long rest.

### Feat: Harpoon Master
You've learned how to use harpoons to maximum effect in combat. 
When you take this feat, you gain the following benefits.
* Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Creatures you've hit with harpoons have their speed reduced by 15 feet until they've removed the harpoon.
* If a creature is concentrating on a spell and ends its turn while impaled by a harpoon you hit it with, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.



### Rope Quality for Nets & Harpoons

Players can gain access to higher-quality rope for nets and harpoon tethers by paying more gold. The following table describes the gp cost for each level of quality. Each table row can be used to describe a net or the rope and supplies needed to attach a tether to a harpoon. In the case of nets, the gp cost describes the overall cost of the net. In the case of harpoon spears and gun bolts, the gp cost describes the added cost of upgrading the item's quality, which can also be done when replacing a snapped tether.  

##### Rope Qualities 
|Cost  | Break DC <br> (Harpoon) | Break DC <br> (Net)  | Rope AC | Cumulative <bR> Damage to Cut |
|:---:|:----:|:----:|:--:|:--:|
| 1gp | 12 | 10  | 10 | 5
| 50gp|  15 | 13  | 13 | 10
| 200gp| 18 | 16  | 16 | 15

## Plague Censers

These insidious weapons have the appearance of a ceremonial censer used for burning incense, but they are shaped into the form of a flail.  Each day, a plague censor can be filled with toxic incense, and as the censor is swung in combat, it unleashes necrotic fumes deadly to all in the vicinity, including the wielder.    


#### Plague Censer
*melee weapon (martial, flail)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d8
- **Damage Type:** Bludgeoning
- **Properties:** Heavy, two-handed, reach, special
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___

***Plague Censor.*** When you make an attack with a plague censer, it releases its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.  Each creature in that area takes 1d6 necrotic damage, including the wielder.  Once a plague censer releases its putrid incense, it can't do so again until the next round.

The plague censer must be filled every 24 hours with 10gp worth of putrid incense to maintain this trait.



### Feat: Plague Censer Fanatic
You've learned how to develop a supernatural bond with a plague censor, drawing perverse fortitude from it even as you are withered by its toxic fumes, and you can use this bond as a focus for your magical abilities.   You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with plague censers.

*  As long as you are wielding a plague censer containing putrid incense, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and you can perform the somatic components of spells even when it is occupying both your hands.

* When you cast a spell that has somatic components using your plague censer as your spellcasting focus, you may have it release its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.

* When you release putrid incense from a plague censer you are wielding, you may have it deal 1d8 necrotic damage rather than 1d6.

* When you take necrotic damage from a plague censer you are wielding, you get +2 to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you stop wielding the plague censor in both hands.

## Poisoned Wind Globes

#### Poisoned Wind Globes
___
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 1 lb
 
Poisoned wind globes are orbs made of glass or crystal and filled with deadly gas. When shattered, the spheres release billowing toxic clouds so lethal that mere skin contact can cause severe pain or even death.

You can use an action to throw the globe up to 20 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.

When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t poisoned.

### Feat: Poisoned Wind Fumigator 1.0.0
You've become a master of crafting and utilizing poisoned wind globes to maximum effect, and you can even implement globes with gases specialized in poisoning creatures normally resistant or immune to such effects. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with alchemist's supplies, poisoner's kit, or glassblower's tools

* You may have the saving throw for a poisoned wind globe you throw become 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier, and you may add your Intelligence modifier to the poison damage its gas cloud deals.

* At the end of each long rest, choose a creature type other than construct. Creatures of the chosen creature type don't benefit from resistance or immunity to poison damage from poisoned wind globes you throw unless they are under the effect of the *protection from poison* spell.

* If you are proficient with glassblowers tools and either alchemist's supplies or poisoner's kits, and you have them in hand, you can create a new poisoned wind globe from the remains of one that has shattered within the last hour. To do so, you must expend 25 gp worth of alchemist's supplies or poisons over the course of 1 minute to turn the shattered globe into a new poisoned wind globe.

## Things Catchers
This two-handed polearm has a large, tong-like head with the inside of its grips lined with spikes. The weapon is designed to be thrust around the torsos and extremities of foes to grab and painfully subdue them.

___
- **Damage:** 1d4
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** reach, special, two-handed
- **Cost:** 2 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___
***Things Catcher.***  A large or smaller creature you hit with a things catcher is automatically grappled by you. Until the grapple ends, you can't attack any other targets with the things catcher. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check (its choice), freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. If a creature has multiple attacks with the Attack action, it can replace any number of them with these checks. The grapple also ends if you drop the things catcher.

### Feat: Things Wrangler
You developed the abilities needed to wield things catchers in more versatile ways and make them more difficult to escape from, granting you the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with things catchers.

* You treat things catchers as though they have the versatile property, dealing 1d6 piercing damage with two hands and 1 piercing damage with one hand.

* You can use two-weapon fighting while wielding a things catcher as long as one of the weapons you are wielding is light.

* You may have the grapple escape DC of a things catcher you are wielding be 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier.

## Throwing Stars

These small, sharpened metal stars can be thrown or used as a stabbing weapon to deal small amounts of damage and potentially deliver poisoned attacks.  Their small size and unassuming nature make them ideal concealed weapons.

- **Cost:** 5 sp

___

***Throwing Star.*** You can use two-weapon fighting to make off-hand attacks with throwing stars as though they are melee weapons, and you can use throwing stars to make melee weapon attacks as though they are light melee weapons. However, you still have disadvantage on these attack rolls if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and isn't incapacitated. 

### Feat: Throwing Star Master
You mastered the art of using the normally unassuming throwing star to disrupt your foes and set up brutal follow-on attacks, granting you the following benefits:  

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with throwing stars.

* You can draw a throwing star as part of the attack you make with it.

* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using a throwing star that did not suffer from disadvantage, you can gain advantage on the next melee weapon attack or unarmed strike you make against that creature this turn.
