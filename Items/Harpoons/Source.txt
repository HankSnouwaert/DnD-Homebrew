## Harpoons
The following content can be used to <br> add harpoon weaponry to your game <br> world.  The Harpoon Master feat can help <br> players specialize in using these weapons, <br> and the statistics for the Rope Qualities can <br> be used to upgrade the reliability of harpoon <br> tethers and net weapons.

### Harpoon Weapons

##### Harpoon Gun
*Martial ranged weapon, cost: 90gp, ammunition cost: 2gp*<br>
*1d6 piercing*, *ammunition (range 30/120), loading, special* <br>

##### Harpoon Spear
*Martial melee weapon, cost: 2gp*<br>
*1d6 piercing*, *special, thrown (20/60), versatile (1d8)*<br><br>

**Harpoons.** You can choose to tether yourself with a rope to a creature or object you hit with the harpoon. If you are using a harpoon gun, you must hold onto the gun to maintain this tether, and if you are using a spear, you must have a free hand to maintain this tether. You cannot maintain multiple tethers in one hand. You can drag tethered objects using the rope or pull tethered creatures towards you as though you are grappling them. 

Any creature within 5 feet of the target can use an action to remove the harpoon.  Doing so deals an additional 1d6 weapon damage to the target.

A tethered creature that attempts to move away from you must succeed an opposed Strength check against you.  If it succeeds, it drags you in the direction it moves.  If both of you roll a 10 or higher on this check, the tether snaps.  Dealing 5 slashing damage to the tether (AC 10) also snaps it.

If you recover a harpoon spear or a harpoon gun bolt with a snapped rope, you can replace the rope over the course of 10 minutes, using 1gp worth of rope and other supplies.  This can be done over the course of a short or long rest.

### New Feat: Harpoon Master
You've learned how to use harpoons to maximum effect in combat. 
When you take this feat, you gain the following benefits.
* Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Creatures you've hit with harpoons have their speed reduced by 15 feet until they've removed the harpoon.
* If a creature is concentrating on spell and ends its turn while impaled by a harpoon you hit it with, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

### Rope Quality for Nets & Harpoons

By paying more gold, players can gain access to higher quality rope for nets and harpoon tethers.  The following table describes the gp cost for each level of quality.  Each row of the table can be used to describe a net, or the rope and supplies need to attach a tether to a harpoon.  In the case of nets, the gp cost describes the overall cost of the net.  In the case of harpoon spears and harpoon gun bolts, the gp cost describes the added cost of upgrading the quality of the item, which can also be done when replacing a snapped tether.  

##### Rope Qualities
