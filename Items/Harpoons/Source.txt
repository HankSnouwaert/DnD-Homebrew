## Harpoons
The following content can <br> be used to add harpoon <br> weaponry to your game world. <br> The Harpoon Master feat can <br> help players specialize in using <br> these weapons, and the statistics <br> for the Rope Qualities can be used <br> to upgrade the reliability of harpoon <br> tethers and net weapons.

***Harpoons.*** You can choose to tether yourself with a rope to a creature or object you hit with the harpoon; otherwise, you can pull the harpoon back to yourself as an object interaction. If you choose to tether yourself, the hand you used to make the attack becomes occupied maintaining the tether. You cannot maintain multiple tethers in one hand, and creatures immune to the grappled condition cannot be tethered. 

Once per turn, you can make an opposed Strength check against a creature you have tethered (no action required). On a success, you can drag the tethered creature towards you. Doing so uses up 5 feet of movement for every 5 feet you drag it unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you. A tethered creature can attempt to do the same to you on its turn, though if you fail the opposed Strength check, you can choose to drop the tether rather than be dragged by it. Any time an opposed Strength check is made between you and a tethered creature, if both of you roll a 12 or higher on this check, the tether snaps. 

Any creature within 5 feet of a tethered creature (including the tethered creature) can use an action to remove the harpoon. Doing so deals an additional 1d6 weapon damage to the creature as the harpoon is removed. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the tether (AC 10) also snaps it.

If you recover a harpoon spear or a harpoon gun bolt with a snapped rope, you can replace the rope over 10 minutes, using 1gp worth of rope and other supplies. This can be done over the course of a short or long rest.

### New Feat: Harpoon Master
You've learned how to use harpoons to maximum effect in combat. 
When you take this feat, you gain the following benefits.
* Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Creatures you've hit with harpoons have their speed reduced by 15 feet until they've removed the harpoon.
* If a creature is concentrating on a spell and ends its turn while impaled by a harpoon you hit it with, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration.

### Rope Quality for Nets & Harpoons

Players can gain access to higher-quality rope for nets and harpoon tethers by paying more gold. The following table describes the gp cost for each level of quality. Each table row can be used to describe a net or the rope and supplies needed to attach a tether to a harpoon. In the case of nets, the gp cost describes the overall cost of the net. In the case of harpoon spears and gun bolts, the gp cost describes the added cost of upgrading the item's quality, which can also be done when replacing a snapped tether.  

##### Rope Qualities

| 50gp|  15 | 13  | 13 | 10
