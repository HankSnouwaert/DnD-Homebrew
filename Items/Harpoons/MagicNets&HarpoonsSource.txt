## Magic Harpon Guns


## Magic Harpoon Spears

#### Anchor
*Harpoon spear, uncommon (requires attunement)*

The weapon has the heavy and two handed properties, its attacks deal 2d6 piercing damage, and creatures wielding it must have a Strength of 14 or higher to make attacks with it without disadvantage. When you strike a creature with the anchor, you can choose not to tether it and instead deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing, and if it is Huge or smaller, it is knocked back 10 feet. Additionally, a Huge or smaller creature tethered by the anchor moves at half its speed. 

#### Sewing Needle
*Harpoon spear, uncommon (requires attunement)*

When you tether a creature with this weapon, the needle pierces through the target, allowing you to call it back using an object interaction while keeping the target tethered. Maintaining the tether still occupies one of your hands. However, you can tether additional creatures with this needle, and each tether made with the needle can be maintained with the same hand. Creatures tethered by the needle can only be freed by snapping the line, which frees all tethered creatures.


#### Underworld Skewer
*Harpoon spear, uncommon (requires attunement)*

These ghastly harpoons are said to be forged in the underworld and are capable of tethering incorporeal creatures normally immune to the grappled condition. The tethers attached to these harpoons take on a ghostly quality and cannot be cut. 

While this harpoon is impaled in a creature, the wielder who threw the harpoon may use an action to call the harpoon back, causing it to rip itself free and deal its weapon damage to the creature it was impaling before returning back to the thrower and either landing in an open hand or stowing itself with the thrower (throwerâ€™s choice.) 

When a creature calls back one of these harpoons this way, all harpoons it has thrown that are currently impaled in a creature are returned this way.


#### Electro-Harpoon
*Harpoon spear, uncommon (requires attunement)*

As an action, you can electrify the tether between yourself and a harpooned target. Each creature directly between you and the harpoon must succeed on a DC X Dexterity save or take XdX lightning damage. The harpooned target automatically fails this save.

#### Magic Fishing Rod
*Harpoon spear, uncommon (requires attunement)*

The weapon consists of the pole, and should the hook be lost or the tether broken, the wielder can use an action to add rope to the pole, which then automatically creates a new hook at the end. 

* Melee attacks made with this weapon deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing and cannot tether targets.  
* The distances for ranged attacks made with this weapon increase to 60/200. 
* Whenever a creature you can see makes a bite attack, you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it with this pole. If this attack hits, the creature has disadvantage on the bite attack.

## Magic Nets

#### Anti-Magic Net
*Net, uncommon*

A creature hit by this net must succeed on a DCX Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on any ongoing spells and be unable to cast spells until the start of its next turn. At the start of each turn that it is restrained by the net, the creature must succeed on the same saving throw or be subjected to the effects again until the start of its next turn.

#### Ghost Net
*Net, uncommon*

This net can restain incorporeal creatures normally immune to the restrained condition. Creatures restrained by the net cannot planeshift to the Ethereal Plane.

#### Electro-Net
*Net, uncommon*

Creatures restrained by this net take XdX lighting damage at the start of each of their turns and can't take reactions.
