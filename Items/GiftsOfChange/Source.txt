# Gifts of Change
Powerful demons or cults of mutation and forbidden knowledge will sometimes craft magical items which channel their otherworldly and unpredictable powers.  They may wield these items themselves or gift them to worthy followers, though they often shatter the minds of mere mortals.  The following magic items can be used to represent these gifts of change in your campaign.

#### Blade of Fate
*Weapon (any sword), rare*<br>

Visions of future victories dance across this blade's reflective surface.  None know if it predicts fate or twists it.

At dawn each day, roll two d20s.  If you roll a 20 on either dice, reroll it until you roll a different number.  Record the final results of each dice.

When you make an attack roll with this weapon and roll one of the numbers you noted, you may treat the roll as if it were a 20.  You can only use each of the noted numbers once this way.  At dawn each day, you lose the numbers from the previous day.



#### Chromatic Tome
*Wonderous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This tome serves as a prison to a sorcerous demon, and offers great power to those willing to assume terrible risks.

While attuned to this book, you can read from its pages to gather the winds of magic.  This can be done as a bonus action or whenever you roll for initiative.  When you do so, the book gains 2d6 charges which last for 1 minute or until you expend them.  If you roll a 2, you gain no charges and must roll on the Miscast Table below to determine what kind of magical backlash you suffer. 

You can't roll for charges again until you spend 10 minutes studying its pages, which can do during a short or long rest.

While the book has charges, you can expend 3 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17  Attack bonus of +9), using it as your spellcasting focus: *chromatic orb* (3 charges), *scorching ray* (4 charges), *shatter* (4 charges), *lightning bolt* (6 charges) *hunger of hadar* (6 charges), *wall of fire* (7 charges).

 ##### Miscast Table
| 2d6 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  | Miscast Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  2  |   Demonic limbs tear through reality and pull you into a demonic realm of torment.  Your body is destroyed, and your soul and physical belongings are transported to a layer of the Abyss in possession of a demon lord of the DM's choosing.  |
|  3-4  |  You violently discharge arcane energy, dealing 10d6 force damage to you and each creature within 15 feet of you.|
|  5-6  |   The treacherous demon trapped within the book gives its aid elsewhere.  For the next minute, a creature of the DM's choosing within 100 feet of you gains the ability to cast spells as though it were holding the tome with 12 charges available.|
|  7  |  You take 4d6 necrotic damage and can't cast spells until the start of your next turn.|
|  8-9 |    A massive vortex drains all the magic in the area.  You take 8d6 force damage, and all spells with 100 feet of you are dispelled as though targeted by *dispel magic* cast at 9th level.|
|  10-11  | Your mind is ravaged by demons, causing you to be under the effects of the *feeblemind* spell for the next 10 minutes.|
| 12  | The book becomes overloaded,  gaining 12 charges.  Until it loses these charges, spell attack rolls made as part of casting spells from the book are made with advantage, and all creatures have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make against a spell cast from the book.  The book can't regain charges for the next 1d4 days.|

#### Paradoxical Armor 
*Armor, very rare*<br>

This armor flickers in and out of existence, <br> appearing solid at one second and incorporeal the <Br> next. Attackers have an almost equal chance of <Br> hitting its wearer no matter their positioning or tactics.

While wearing this armor, no attack roll can gain <br> advantage or disadvantage against you.

#### Staff of Change
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement)*<br>

This staff infuses spells with the raw powers of <Br> chaos, inflicting random mutations on its victims.

While holding this staff, the save DC of all your <Br> spells increases by +1.

Additionally, when one or more creatures fail a saving throw against a spell you cast of 3rd level or higher while wielding this staff, you can choose one of those creatures <Br> and cause it to suffer a random mutation determined by the Mutation Table below.  At the end of each of the target's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw against the spell's save DC, ending all mutations affecting it on a success.  A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation | Creature Effect |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded and has blindsight with a radius of 5 feet.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight.   At the start of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|

#### Unfathomable Tome
*Wonderous item, very rare, (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This demonic text offers wizards a seemingly endless amount of arcane knowledge, though plumbing its depths risks one's sanity.

This book can be used as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and while you are carrying it, you can speak and write in Abyssal.  The book functions as a spellbook for you, and the gold and time you must spend to copy spells into it is halved.  Spells from this book cannot be copied into other spellbooks.

Additionally, you may spend an hour studying the book to uncover its secrets. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

When you do so, name three different spells from the wizard spell list that are the same level that you have seen cast or read of in texts such as spellbooks or spell scrolls.  Label these spells 1 through 3.  Roll a d4 and add the spell whose number matches the result to your spellbook.  On a roll of 4, you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spells.  On a failure, you gain a random long-term madness effect for the number of days equal to the level of the chosen spells.  The book can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

When this book becomes unattuned to a creature, all the spells it contains are lost.

####  Wand of Whimsy
*Wand, very rare (requires attunement)* <br> 

This wand was carved from demonic bones and is capable of reducing its victims into writhing beasts of chaotic flesh.

While holding this wand, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls.

When you attack a small or larger creature with a spell attack and roll a 20 on the attack roll while holding this wand, that target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw.  On a failure, the creature dies and its body turns into a **blue horror of change** under your control.  An additional **blue horror of change** is created for each size category above medium the creature was.  

Any **blue horror of change** and any **brimstone horrors of change** they spawn share your initiative count.   They take their turns immediately after yours in any order, and they obey your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don't issue any commands, the horrors spend their turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of their abilities.  Any horrors made this way melt into goo after 1 minute.  

A creature killed this way can only be revived by a *true resurrection* spell or by a *wish* spell
