## Specialized Iron Orcs
The elite iron orcs of the rocky wastes are the most powerful and well-trained of their kind. While just as bloodthirsty as other orcs, they temper their savage instincts with unflinching discipline and a dour, humorless demeanor. This discipline and training allows iron orcs to specialize in advanced forms of combat beyond the reach of most typical orcs. The following iron orcs are examples of their kind that have mastered such specialized forms of combat.

### Iron Orc War Chanters & War Callers
Within iron orc tribes, war chanters and war callers play a crucial role in the heat of battle. Each wields two massive blunt clubs, which they use to pound on rugged war drums or even their own metal armor, creating a booming, resonant tempo that echoes across the battlefield. As the battle begins, the rhythm intensifies, quickening with the rising violence and driving the orcs to move faster, strike harder, and endure blows that would normally bring them down. The war caller, like a conductor leading an orchestra, can influence the tactics of the orcs in combat. Under their guidance, iron orc armies become precision tools of destruction, their actions perfectly synchronized to the relentless beat, turning them into a terrifying force of coordinated violence.

\columnbreak

#### Iron Orc War Chanters and War Callers Tactics
Iron orc war chanters and war callers adjust their strategies based on the composition of their enemies.

**Enduring Beat:** Used when the majority of their allies are below half health. It focuses on sustaining and protecting weakened forces.

**Rushing Beat:** Used if any of their melee martial allies cannot reach the opponents on their next turn, or if there is a significant amount of difficult terrain affecting movement. This beat helps close the distance to the enemy.

**Killing Beat:** The preferred beat when the majority of their allies are above half health, enhancing the offensive capabilities of their group.

### Iron Orc Chain Wrecker

Iron orc chain wreckers are regarded as artists among their kind, wielding chains with a brutal elegance rarely seen in other orcs. Where most would entangle themselves or fall victim to their own weapons, wreckers move fluidly across the battlefield. They expertly sweep aside entire regiments with a metal wrecking ball or brandish twin-hooked chains with deadly precision. With a swift motion, they hurl one end at unsuspecting warriors, pulling their foes in close to be gouged by the other, demonstrating their lethal mastery of this unique and fearsome weapon.

\columnbreak

#### Iron Orc Chain Wrecker Tactics

Iron orc chain wreckers adapt their weapon choice to match the battlefield conditions:

**Ball Chain Chopper:** This weapon is favored when enemies are grouped closely together and to disrupt ranged attackers.

**Hooked Chain Chopper:** This weapon is favored when enemies are more spread out, as it allows the wrecker to pull targets away from advantageous positions and restrain them.

When multiple chain wreckers are present in a battle, they often diversify their weapon choices. The combination of one using the Hooked Chain Chopper to restrain targets and another using the Ball Chain Chopper is an effective strategy.

> ***Crazed Swinging.*** While the orc is not grappled, restrained, prone, or incapacitated and is holding its Ball Chain Chopper and has mastery over it, the orc may swing its Ball Chain Chopper. While it is swinging, creatures within 10 feet of it have disadvantage on ranged attacks. If a creature ends its turn within 10 feet of the orc, it must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 9 (1d10 + 4) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the orc can't attack another target.

### Iron Orc Bone Breakers
Iron orc bone breakers are infamous within their tribes for their sheer brutality and reckless abandon in combat. Unlike their more disciplined kin, Bone Breakers revel in the chaos of battle, charging headlong into the thick of the fight with little regard for their own safety. Their attacks are devastatingly powerful, delivering crushing blows that shatter bones and leave their enemies crippled and gasping for breath—if they’re fortunate enough to survive at all. Lacking the level-headedness of other iron orcs, Bone Breakers are driven by a primal fury, making them unpredictable and extremely dangerous

\columnbreak

#### Iron Orc Bone Breakers Tactics

Bone breakers adapt their weapon choice based on the dynamics of the battlefield and their allies' actions:

**Crusher Chopper:** Used when the bone breaker's allies are causing the opponent to make a large number of saving throws. 

**Greataxe Chopper:** Used when the bone breaker's allies are executing a high volume of attacks. 

Bone breakers prioritize attacking targets with low Strength. If there are multiple bone breakers, they will split up who has mastered what weapons to help synergize each weapon's strengths.

> ***Da Plan.*** When the orc rolls initiative, it may choose to master one of its weapons, gaining an additional effect until the end of combat (included in the attack).
> 
> ***Shattering Strike (1/turn).*** When the orc makes its first attack each turn, if it hits, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw, or the orc automatically hits the target with the same weapon again as part of the same action. If the target fails by 10 or more (DC 4), the attack is a critical hit. The orc can only make one extra attack this way.
>
> ### Actions
>

> ***Crusher Chopper.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If this is the first attack the orc made on its turn, it gets a +1 to the attack roll and on hit, it deals an extra 5 (2d4) damage. If the orc has mastered this weapon, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws and checks until the end of the orc's next turn.
> 
> ***Greataxe Chopper.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d12 + 4) slashing damage. If this is the first attack the orc made on its turn, it gets a +1 to the attack roll and on hit, it deals an extra 5 (2d4) damage. If the orc has mastered this weapon, it can rend the target's defenses, making it so weapon attacks made against the creature score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20 until the end of the orc's next turn.

### Iron Orc Shield Boys

Those unfamiliar with iron orc tactics might be surprised to learn that some iron orcs prefer shields over a second weapon in their offhand. However, it quickly becomes clear that these large metal plates serve far more than just a defensive purpose. Iron orc shield boys use their shields to bash down weaker foes before pinning them with heavy spears or decapitating them with cruel axes. On the battlefield, units of shield boys move with the force of a fortified battering ram, nearly impervious as they crash through their foes with relentless power and precision. Their mastery of shields transforms them into both an impenetrable wall and a deadly weapon.

\columnbreak

#### Iron Orc Shield Boys Tactics
Shield Boys select their weapon mastery based on the tactical needs of their group:

**Shield Chopper:** Chosen if the shield boy is the only one among its allies capable of effectively knocking targets prone.

**Pike Chopper:** Chosen to keep targets from getting back up after being knocked prone.

**Greataxe Chopper:** Chosen if the shield boy has allies that can knock targets prone and prevent them from getting back up.

When multiple shield boys work together, they coordinate to maximize effectiveness. Each shield boy adopts a specific role: knocking the target down, preventing them from rising, and dealing additional damage to prone targets.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 8), it can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so. If this is the first attack the orc made on its turn, it gets a +1 to the attack roll, on hit it deals an extra 5 (2d4) damage and if the orc has mastered this weapon, the creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.

If the target is a prone creature and the orc has mastered this weapon, the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the orc's speed is 0, and it can't attack another creature with the Pike Chopper or switch weapons.
