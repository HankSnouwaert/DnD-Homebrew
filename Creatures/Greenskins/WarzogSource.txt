## Warzog
*Da Best Prophet*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Hills, <br> Mountains, Underdark; <br> **Treasure:** Individual, Relics <br>

Through the annals of history, countless <br> prophets, seers, and divine heralds have stomped <br> across the mortal world, dutifully relaying whatever cosmic memo their patron deity was dictating to them. Some were revered. Some were martyred. Some were so nonsensical that even their own followers couldn’t remember why they were following them to begin with. But among these celestial mouthpieces, none have ever matched the sheer, unparalleled greatness of the aptly named Warzog, Da Best Prophet.

Or so claim the orcs. Every single one of them. Enthusiastically. Loudly. And, most often, violently. Other races, for reasons entirely unfathomable to orcish sensibilities, tend to vehemently disagree with this assertion, dismissing it as "absurd," "nonsensical," and in one particularly strong-worded case, "a total load of hogwash."

However, belief in Warzog’s indisputable, irrefutable, utterly unquestionable status as the greatest prophet stems from his discovery of The Three Categorical Truths of Everythin’:

**1.** Orcs are da best.

**2.** The more Orcish you and your mates are, the more scraps you win.

**3.** If you ever meet a git more Orcish than yourself, just be even more Orcish.

These fundamental truths have never been disputed by an orc. Even the thickest-headed git understands these principles when they are laid bare. The only problems in an orc’s life arise when they forget these truths. And truly, this is the only problem an orc can ever have—usually due to some other group of un-Orcish fellows attempting to prove their own way of being "the best" in a manner that does not involve being an orc. Which, of course, is utter nonsense.

But this is precisely where Warzog shines. For no one is better at reminding them.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Wherever he goes, Warzog seeks out forgotten tribes who are no longer being their best Orcish selves. With great care and even more noise, he riles up the tribe, ensuring they remember that they are the best before leading them in a spectacularly violent corrective campaign against anyone foolish enough to have tricked them into thinking otherwise. Following a thorough and enthusiastic reaffirmation of Orcish Dominance, Warzog then sets off to do it all over again somewhere else. But before he leaves, he makes sure to use the generous amount of rubble provided by the now-departed not-orc population to build massive monuments to the Orcish god—just to make sure that no one ever forgets what it means to be an orc. 

**Why Warzog is Clearly Da Best.**
Warzog’s far-reaching success comes from his knack for making a point without resorting to words. Orcs, after all, don’t care much for talking. Instead, Warzog demonstrates his fundamental truths through action.

His unshakable self-assured superiority warps reality to his eccentric will—a sight that would unsettle anyone who isn’t an orc. Heads burst at his presence, and both armor and flesh crumble under the weight of his unwavering stare. Even the mightiest champions, should they dare question orcish supremacy, are instantly transformed into small, squirming pests before being teleported into Warzog’s iron grip. After all, nothing's more un-orcish than finding yourself turned into a shrieking, helpless nuisance  in the hands of a true orc.

Such is the legend of Warzog, Da Best. Should you, by some astounding chance, meet an orc who claims otherwise, rest assured—they won’t hold that opinion for long.

> ### Traits
> ***Primal Surge.*** Warzog is quickened** during the first round of combat.
>
> ***Squiggly Curse (1/Day).*** On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Warzog chooses up to six creatures within 90 feet of him that he is aware of. Each must succeed on a DC 18 Charisma saving throw. Warzog then chooses one creature that fails this saving throw, which is afflicted by the curse and immediately transformed into a **Squiggly Beast**, teleporting into Warzog’s free hand where he immediately grapples it (escape DC 19). The transformed creature uses the Squiggly Beast’s statistics, except it retains its original hit points, Hit Dice, and Constitution score, as well as its alignment and personality. This transformation ends if the target dies, Warzog dies, or another creature is afflicted by this feature.  
> The target’s gear melds into its new form; it can’t activate, use, or otherwise benefit from that equipment, nor can it interact with any dropped gear. It also can’t speak, cast spells, or perform actions requiring hands or speech. Only a spell of 6th level or higher can remove this effect.
>
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** Warzog makes two melee attacks.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** Warzog is a spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +12 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:
> - **At will:** *guidance, mage hand, thaumaturgy, brain burster** (3rd level), *brutal glare**, *psychic headbutt**, *savage fists**  
> - **3/day each:** *arcane hand, here we go!**  
> - **1/day each:** *foot of the gods** 
>
> <Br>***Quarterstaff Chopper.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 8 (1d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) if wielded with two hands. If this is the first attack Warzog makes on his turn, it deals an extra 5 (2d4) damage.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Aggressive.*** Warzog can move up to his speed toward a hostile creature he can see.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> Warzog can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature’s turn. He regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
>
> **Check.** Warzog makes a skill check that would normally require an action.  
>
> **Jumbo Prod.** Warzog channels psychic force to shove a creature within 100 feet of him that just took its turn. That creature must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet in a direction of Warzog’s choice. If Warzog is grappling a Squiggly Beast, the DC increases to 22 and the target also takes 13 (3d8) force damage on a failed save.
>
> **Noggin Shaker.** Warzog rattles the mind of a creature within 100 feet of him that just took its turn. That creature must succeed on a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become dazed** until the end of its next turn. If Warzog is grappling a Squiggly Beast, the DC increases to 22 and the target also takes 13 (3d8) psychic damage on a failed save.
>
> **Snatch Up.** Warzog moves up to 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks, then attempts to grapple a Squiggly Beast within 5 feet of him that has just taken its turn.  
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If Warzog is suffering from an effect that requires him to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of his next turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success. Warzog can use this legendary action even if he is incapacitated.

### Epic Battle:<Br> Ju-Ju Ward
For a mythic encounter with Warzog, increase his hit points to 512 HP and grant him the Ju-Ju Ward ability. His Challenge Rating (CR) increases to 21.

***Ju-Ju Ward (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).***
When Warzog is reduced to 256 hit points or fewer, he may immediately end any spells affecting him and recharge his Squiggly Curse ability.

Additionally, while a **Squiggly Beast** is within 120 feet of him, he gains a protective ward for the next hour, granting him resistance to all damage unless the damage is caused by a creature that is grappling a Squiggly Beast.

Warzog does not benefit from the ward while he is affected by Squiggly Bane.



### Ashragoth's Lair (NOTE: Need Lair Write Up)
Ashragoth makes his lair in an obsidian tower located within a volcanic wasteland. Within the ziggurat, countless forges and altars are dedicated to the dark gods. The petrified bodies of former pupils and rivals of Ashragoth are embedded within the ramparts of the structure, At the heart of the temple lies Ashragoth’s personal laboratory, where he conducts his own dark experiments.

#### Lair Actions

When Warzog rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or Warzog dies, the lair has an Intelligence 5 and can act of its own accord but always acts in Warzog's best interest. While active this way, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

While in his lair, Warzog's challenge rating increases by 1.

**Ju-Ju Hex.** The lair chooses a Squiggly Beast within it, cursing the creature with a Ju-Ju Hex for 1 minute, until Warzog dies, or until the creature receives the Squiggly Boon. While cursed, the creature takes 13 (3d8) force damage at the end of each of its turns.

**Ju-Ju Surge.** Warzog gains a surge of ju-ju energy. This effect lasts until he leaves the lair, dies, or is affected by Squiggly Bane. While benefiting from the surge, Warzog regains 13 (3d8) hit points at the end of each of his turns. (NOTE: Will this keep stacking?)

**Mumbo-Jumbo Burst.** The lair chooses a Squiggly Beast within it and releases a surge of energy in a 20-foot radius around it. Each creature other than a Squiggly Beast in that area must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

> ***Squiggly Boon.*** The squiggly beast rolls a d6 and chooses one creature within 5 feet of it. That creature adds the result of the roll to its AC and any saving throws it makes until the end of the squiggly beast’s next turn.
>
> ***Squiggly Bane.*** The squiggly beast rolls a d6 and chooses one creature within 5 feet of it that is not grappling it. That creature subtracts the result of the roll from its AC and any saving throws it makes until the end of the squiggly beast’s next turn.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Nimble Escape.*** The squiggly beast takes the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge action.
>
> ### Reaction
> ***Absorb Spell.*** If the squiggly beast is subjected to a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage on a successful save, and half damage on a failed one. Also, if it succeeds, it can choose itself or another creature within 5 feet of it. The first time the chosen creature hits with an attack on its next turn, the target of that attack takes an additional 10 (3d6) force damage.

### Warzog's Tactics
Warzog's primary goal during battle is to keep hold of the Ju-Ju Squiggly Beast, if there is one. His priority target is any creature currently holding the Squiggly Beast.

#### Default Spell Usage
**Stomping Foot.** A great opening move to force grouped enemies into unfavorable positions. Focus on prone creatures to gain bonus damage. <br>

<br>**Arcane Hand.** Use if *foot of the gods* is not available. 
* Primarily used to grab backline opponents and drag them into melee combat.
* Can also be used to grab and restrain the Squiggly Beast.

<br>**Headbutt.** Used to break the concentration of enemy spellcasters.
* Priority over all other spells if an enemy spellcaster is concentrating on a higher-level spell than Warzog can cast.

<br>**Brain Burster.** Use frequently to disrupt enemy spellcasters.

<Br>**Brutal Glare.** Use when:
* Two or more targets with low Dexterity are in range.
* A 5th or higher-level spell is not available.

##### Legendary Actions
* **Snatch Up.** Used to retrieve a Squiggly Beast that has escaped, if it is within 20 feet.
* **Noggin Shaker.** Forces a creature to drop the Squiggly Beast. Useful if the target has a high Strength saving throw.
* **Jumbo Prod.** Used when:
    * The creature holding the Squiggly Beast is more than 20 feet away from Warzog.
    * Use on the Squiggly Beast itself if it is not currently grappled.

##### Lair Actions
* **Ju-Ju Surge.** Used if Warzog is holding the Squiggly Beast.
* **Ju-Ju Hex.** Used if enemies are spread out. Targets the creature furthest from the Squiggly Beast.
* **Mombo-Jumbo Burst.** Used if two or more creatures are within 15 feet of the Ju-Ju Beast.

### New Orcish Spells

####  Brain Burster
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d8 psychic  damage, and until the end of your next turn, it has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma  checks, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration. 
Additionally, if the creature  attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher before the end of your next turn, it must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot or other resource, the slot or resource isn’t expended.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

####  Brutal Glare
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You fixate on two points within the spell's range, no more than 30 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of glowing force erupt from your eyes, blazing between the two points. Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 force damage. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d10, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

\columnbreak

#### Foot of The Gods
*7th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer

You call forth a massive foot from the heavens to crash down onto the battlefield. You select a point you can see, between 30 to 500 feet above you within range. A 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide foot appears at the chosen point and immediately descends. The foot passes through any Huge or smaller creatures and objects until it descends 500 feet or hits a solid surface, or a Gargantuan creature or object, at which point the foot rises back up into the sky to where its descent started. As an action on your turn, you can move the foot up to 30 feet, rotate it, and then have the foot descend in the same way.

Each creature or object the foot comes in contact with while descending must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so. The creature is also pushed along with the foot until it rises back up. If a creature that fails the saving throw is already prone, it takes an additional 2d12 bludgeoning damage.



####  Here We Go!
*4th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action.
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Paladin, Ranger, Warlock

You chant, imbuing yourself and up to three creatures you can see with fighty energy. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you or a creature you chose misses with an unarmed strike or weapon attack roll, you may have it reroll the attack. The creature must use the new roll.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

#### Psychic Headbutt
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

A disruptive bolt of energy emanates from your head toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. The attack has advantage and cannot have disadvantage if the target is concentrating on a spell. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage. If the creature makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, you may choose to set the saving throw DC equal to your spell save DC.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

\pagebreakNum

#### Savage Fists
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Druid, Ranger

Your fists become as hard as iron, and you are filled with fighting fury. When you cast this spell, you make an unarmed strike and gain the following benefits for the duration of the spell:

* You can use your spellcasting modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

* You can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

* You may use your spellcasting modifier when making Strength checks instead of your Strength modifier.


<br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.
