## Zagruk Anvilcrusha

Though iron orcs are known for their heavy armor and sturdy weapons—typically scavenged from battlefields and crudely reforged using basic smithing skills—there are rare orcs with a true gift for crafting. Zagruk Anvilcrusha is one such legendary figure. Acting as a conduit for the orcish gods, Anvilcrusha receives divine inspiration to craft weapons and armor infused with the raw power of his deities. While he cannot always predict the final form or enchantment of these creations, they are always capable of unleashing devastating force when wielded by a true orc fanatic.

The energy Anvilcrusha channels is so potent that merely striking his crude tools against his anvil causes the weapons of nearby iron orcs to glow green-hot with divine energy. Entire iron orc clans have sought his craftsmanship, benefiting from his ability to forge enchanted, ironclad warriors who tear through the landscape, leaving a trail of ruin in their wake. His creations are revered not only for their power but also for the divine wrath they seem to carry, making his warbands nearly unstoppable.

Anvilcrusha is occasionally seen on the battlefield accompanied by a rockbrow beast, a strange elemental creature that serves as a living anvil. The origins of this beast are a mystery, but its flat stone head can withstand the punishing strikes of Anvilcrusha’s hammer without harm. In fact, the more Anvilcrusha hammers upon it, the more enraged and powerful the creature becomes. Once fully infused with divine energy, the rockbrow beast is unleashed, barreling through enemy lines with stone-splitting force, a terrifying weapon in its own right.

#### Smith Tools of Da Gods 
*Smithing tools,  rare (requires attunement), 6,000 gp*

*The set of blacksmithing tools used by the Anvilcrusha for his divine work still radiates with residual power. Those attuned to these tools may be able to imbue their own weapons with destructive enchantment for but a brief moment.*

You gain a +3 to any checks made using these tools.

The tools have 5 charges. While holding them, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 charge to empower one weapon that you can see within 60 feet. The weapon gains one of the following benefits at random until the start of your next turn:

1. The weapon deals an extra 7 (2d6) lightning damage when it hits a target, and lightning leaps from the target to a different creature of its choice that it can see within 5 feet of the first target. The second creature takes the same amount of lightning damage.

2. The weapon deals an extra 7 (2d6) thunder damage when it hits a target, and the target becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of its next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 14 (4d6) thunder damage.

3. The weapon deals an extra 7 (2d6) fire damage when it hits a target, and the target ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the flames, the target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.

4. The weapon deals an extra 14 (4d6) force damage when it hits a target.

The tools regain 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.

### Epic Battle: Rockbrow Beast

To create a more difficult boss battle, you may include a **rockbrow beast** along with Zagruk Anvilcrusha and give Zagruk access to legendary actions. When doing so, treat both creatures together as a CR 13 creature for the purposes of XP and encounter difficulty.

<br>

> ### Epic Battle Legendary Actions
>
> &emsp; **Move.** Zagruk and the Rockbrow Beast move up to 20 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity.
>
> **Slam.** The rockbrow beast makes a slam attack.
>
> **Anvil Shock (2 Actions).** Zagruk strikes the rockbrow beast with his hammer, creating a burst of energy that ripples outward from him. A rockbrow beast of Zagruk's choice that he can see gains a level of agitation for the next minute (up to a max of 5), and each creature Zagruk chooses within 30 feet of him must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 17 (5d6) thunder damage and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

<Br>

### Anvilcrusha Tactics
Anvilcrusha should be accompanied by at least three or more allies to be fully effective. Anvilcrusha’s primary tactic is to immediately use Power of Da Great God and begin empowering as many allies as possible before the effect ends. While his allies are still alive, he will continue using Imbue With Da Forge.

#### Rockbrow Beast Tactics

If Anvilcrusha is accompanied by his rockbrow beast, the beast will stay near him, taking the Dodge action until Power of Da Great Gods ends. This allows the rockbrow beast to gain levels of agitation. Anvilcrusha can also use his Anvil Shock legendary action to further agitate the rockbrow beast.

Once the Power of Da Great Gods ability ends, Anvilcrusha will use his legendary actions to move and have the rockbrow attack as many targets as possible, provided it has two or more levels of agitation.

> ##### Armed by the Anvilcrusha

>
> You can give an orc one of the effects from the *Imbue with Da Forge* legendary action of Zagruk Anvilcrusha. The effect lasts indefinitely. An orc that gains an imbuement has its CR increased by 1 for each attack it can make on its turn.
