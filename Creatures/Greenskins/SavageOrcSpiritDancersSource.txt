## Savage Orc Spirit Dancers

Among the primitive orcish tribes, hunting the most dangerous monsters was considered the most sacred of rites. They believed that the Orcish Gods imbued wild beasts with fragments of their divine ferocity—especially the more fearsome and untamed creatures, which were thought to contain the greatest concentration of this power. By slaying these beasts, crafting weapons, fetishes, and trinkets from their bones, and mixing their fat and blood into ritualistic war paints, orcs sought to absorb the might of their prey, merging their own spirits with the primal essence of these formidable creatures.

At the heart of this practice were the spirit dancers. When a tribe felled a truly mighty beast, the spirit dancer was granted the portion of the creature deemed to contain its greatest essence. From this, they would craft totems, charms, or adornments, incorporating them into their own bodies as relics of power. Over time, a seasoned spirit dancer would accumulate a trove of these mystical trinkets, each infused with the raw might of fallen creatures. Through strange and ancient dances, they could awaken the latent spirit within these relics, channeling their power to imbue the tribe’s warriors with supernatural strength.

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Those blessed by the spirit dancer might charge into battle with the momentum of a rhino, unleash the deafening trumpet of a mammoth, or strike with the lethal precision of a predatory beast.

As the decades passed, many orc tribes abandoned the sacred hunt, their traditions fading with the rise of technology and the extinction of the great megafauna. However, among the savage orcs, the rite remains venerated. These tribes continue their sacred hunts, seeking out the last vestiges of feral might that persist in the world. Many have become nomadic, forever roaming in search of prey worthy of their ancestral challenge. Any who cross their path—or worse, attempt to hinder their sacred quest—must face not only the fury of seasoned hunters but also the unleashed wrath of their spiritual menagerie.

The most skilled among the spirit dancers—those who have amassed the greatest collection of trophies crafted from the most powerful beasts—are known as invokers. Their mastery is so great that they can summon forth the true essence of the creatures they embody, infusing their warriors with unmatched wild fury, allowing them to rend their enemies to pieces.

##### Beast Spirit Table  
| d6  | Spirit |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1  | ***Boar.*** When the orc hits a creature with its first weapon attack on its turn, the creature is knocked prone if it is Large or smaller. If the attack was made using a quickened action, the orc may push the creature up to 10 feet away as well. |
|  2  | ***Triceratops.*** When the orc hits a creature with its first weapon attack on its turn, the target becomes disrupted until the end of the orc's next turn. While disrupted, the creature can't gain the benefits of the Disengage or Dodge action, and if it is within 10 feet of the orc, it has disadvantage on all attacks. If the attack was made using a quickened action, the creature deals only half damage with attacks while within 10 feet of the orc while it is disrupted. |
|  3  |***Rhino.*** When the orc hits a creature with its first weapon attack on its turn, the target is grappled if it was a melee attack (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the orc can't attack another target. If it was a ranged attack, the target is pinned to a surface within 5 feet, reducing its speed to 0. A creature within 5 feet of the pinned target can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength check, ending the effect on a success. If the attack was made using a quickened action, the creature is restrained until the grapple or pin ends. |

|  4  | ***Mammoth.*** When the orc makes its first weapon attack on its turn, the target and each creature within 5 feet take 5 (2d4) thunder damage. If the attack was made using a quickened action, each affected creature instead takes 10 (4d4) thunder damage. |
|  5  | ***Tyrannosaurus.*** When the orc hits a creature with its first weapon attack on its turn, it inflicts two wounds* on the creature. If the attack was made using a quickened action, it inflicts four wounds instead. |
|  6  | ***Wolf.*** When the orc hits a creature with its first weapon attack on its turn, the target becomes exposed until the end of the orc's next turn. While exposed, all attacks made against it have advantage if the orc is within 10 feet of it. If the attack was made using a quickened action, the creature takes an extra 3 (1d6) damage whenever it is hit with an attack while within 10 feet of the orc while it is exposed. |


> ##### Enhanced Savage Orcs
> You can grant a savage orc any number of beast spirit abilities listed above, increasing its CR by 1 for each ability it has.

### Spirit Dancer Tactics
Spirit dancers and invokers avoid direct combat, staying still to channel their Mumbo Jumbo Dance and empower allies through One With The Beast. 

Invokers unleash Wild Surge, always targeting the strongest melee warrior for maximum impact.

#### Beast Spirit Target Priorities

Creatures infused with the different spirits follow the targeting priorities below:

* **Boar.** Blocks enemies from reaching allies; creatures with ranged attacks can kite enemies.

* **Triceratops.** Counters ranged foes and mobile targets by forcing them into close combat.

* **Rhino.** Disrupts backline spellcasters, dragging them out of position; creatures with ranged attacks can pin mobile targets.

* **Mammoth.** Attacks the largest cluster of enemies.

* **Tyrannosaurus.** Wears down high-AC, low-HP foes.

* **Wolf.** Hunts down slow-moving foes, aiding allies.

### Using Beast Spirits To Create Urgency In Adventures
 If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with savage orcs and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the orcs summon more and more bestial spirits to imbue themselves as time passes. This means the more slowly the players progress, the more dangerous the savage orcs will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. You can roll on the Beast Spitit table to determine what spirit they gain.

The rate at which they gain spirits could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.

 Potential scenarios where the orcs are gaining more power over time:

 *  The orcs are hunting down divine beasts, slaying them to capture their power.

 *  Their shamans have begun a grand ritual, drawing in more spirits to infuse their warriors with supernatural might.

 *  A savage orc warboss has taken control of the tribe, convincing them to return to the old ways. As they embrace their primal heritage, they grow stronger, more feral, and deeply attuned to their instincts.

 *  The orcs foresee a great war destined to unfold during a powerful celestial event. As the moment approaches, they become consumed by a rising, savage energy, preparing for the battle to come.

### New Condition: Quickened
 A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

### New Condition: Wounds
While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
 
  * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
  * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
  * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

### New Spell: Wild Surge

*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (a tuft of fur and a fang)

___

* It gains a +2 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
* When it hits with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, it deals one extra die of its damage.
