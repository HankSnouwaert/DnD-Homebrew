## Bonus Savage Orc Infantry

### Savage Orc Arrow Monger

Orc arrow mongers are considered the greatest archers among savage orc tribes. This is not due to any refined expertise in archery; in fact, they are fairly inaccurate because of their fervent lust for combat, which results in them loading and aiming their weapons in a hasty, haphazard manner. However, this zealous desire for bloodshed allows them to draw massive great bows with ease—bows so powerful that even a regular orc would struggle to wield them.

On the battlefield, their relentless volleys darken the skies, unleashing clouds of flint-headed arrows, each the size of a human war pike. As their arrows pierce through enemy ranks—whether by chance or in the rare instance that an orc briefly steadies its aim—the sight of their foes being skewered by a storm of projectiles only fuels their bloodlust. With each moment, the downpour of arrows intensifies.

### Savage Orc Berserker

It is rare, but within the savage orc tribes, some orcs descend into such frenzied states that they are considered mad—even by the brutal standards of their kin. These orcs are raving, simple-minded monsters, easily provoked into violent rampages over the smallest slights. The cause of this insatiable bloodlust remains unknown, even among savage orcs. The most plausible explanations suggest it is triggered either by the aftermath of a particularly brutal battle or by an orc being swept up in an especially potent wave of orcish magic. Yet, even these theories remain unproven, as such transformations can occur without any clear catalyst.

Orcs afflicted with this madness grow increasingly agitated over time, tormented by violent voices in their heads. They seek out any excuse for conflict, attacking anything that moves in their periphery or venturing alone into the wilderness to hunt dangerous beasts with no regard for their own survival. Eventually, a berserker loses the ability to speak, managing only a few guttural words during a war cry. Such orcs must either be exiled—beaten unconscious by their tribe and abandoned far from their settlement—or simply avoided as their kin scatter, hoping the berserker becomes too preoccupied hacking apart whatever unfortunate creature has drawn its wrath. More often than not, that victim is another member of the tribe.

However, some tribes with powerful shamans or mighty chieftains manage to keep these mad warriors in check. A chieftain may subdue a berserker through sheer brute strength, mercilessly beating them into submission, imprisoning them in crude cages, or even burying them in the ground with only their howling head exposed. Shamans, on the other hand, use hexes and enchantments to incapacitate them, forcing them into a drunken stupor. But when the time for war arrives, all restraints are cast aside, and the berserkers are unleashed upon the battlefield.

Savvy commanders who understand the berserkers’ deranged nature view them as uncontrollable yet predictable—akin to an avalanche crashing down upon their enemies. The destructive power of a band of savage orc berserkers rivals that of a natural disaster, as they swing bone axes with such force that they can cleave a horse in two. Should an adversary manage to sidestep a devastating strike, it only serves to enrage the brute further, sending them into even greater heights of unhinged fury.


### Savage Orc Darkfoots

Among Savage Orcs, nothing brings greater joy than crushing powerful foes beneath hefty stone cudgels, skewering them with bone-and-flint spears, and claiming their remains as trophies—unmistakable proof of their supremacy in battle. Yet despite their passion for raw violence, these primal orcs harbor a deep abhorrence for demons, aberrations, undead, and similar horrors born of malignant magic.

While such creatures may share the orcs’ penchant for mayhem, they also spread decay and madness, leaving corruption in their wake. Primal weaponry rarely suffices against these abominations, and even if the creatures fall, their foul remnants continue to poison the land. For these reasons, their mere presence inspires unbridled hatred in the hearts of Savage Orcs.

This hatred often drives many to undertake crusades in the name of the great Orcish gods, seeking to purge these nightmarish entities that twist the purity of brute force. Those who dedicate themselves to this mission are called Darkfoots. These grim warriors mark their bodies with white war paint—making their flesh resemble bleached bone—and streaks of red. In addition to the usual protective properties of orcish paint, these markings ward off the corrupting magic that might weaken their resolve.

When a Darkfoot grasps a weapon, it becomes infused with righteous fury against the unnatural, striking even incorporeal spirits and bypassing wards designed to thwart physical attacks. Most tribes include at least one Darkfoot, who closely allies with the shamans to root out any malignant presence endangering the community. In lands beset by such abominations, entire tribes may be composed of Darkfoots, who viciously hunt and eradicate these monstrosities. Sometimes, one or more Darkfoots roams the world, loyal to no single tribe but only to their sacred duty, lending their strength wherever orcs battle otherworldly threats.

Though these warriors purge evil entities, one should never assume they would spare others who oppose such threats. Darkfoots have been known to raze wizard or bard colleges for employing illusion or enchantment, dismissing these practices as deceptive and un-Orcish. Likewise, they have slain celestial beings that used holy abjurations to quell conflict, branding such interference as a violation of their war-gods’ will.

### Savage Orc Stalkers
Savage orcs who take up the mantle of a stalker possess a bestial nature unmatched by any other in their tribe, inspiring the same respect and fear a wild predator would. An orc who embarks on this path typically harbors a spark of spiritual power that might have led them to become a beast dancer or shaman. However, their thirst for hunt steers them away from such a fate, and their connection to primal magic drives them into the depths of the untamed wilderness in search of worthy prey.

Those who survive this perilous endeavor return changed, both in appearance and demeanor. They are covered in the hides of the creatures they have bested, with claws, horns, teeth, or other bony appendages from their fallen foes strapped to their arms as makeshift weapons. Unlike most Savage Orcs, stalkers are patient and rarely engage in petty conflicts, often silently observing the vast landscape they inhabit. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br>

Yet, when the moment arises, their austere composure vanishes in the blink of an eye, replaced by a primal fervor that sends them feverishly stabbing at whatever has roused their wrath. In these fits of wrath, a stalker is consumed by bloodlust, continuing to carve and tear even after their foe is but a gory heap.

When a tribe of savage orcs departs to hunt the primeval beasts that roam their lands, a stalker leads the way, given a wide berth by their comrades as they employ their unparalleled tracking skills. The moment their quarry is spotted, the stalker rushes forward, mercilessly tearing into it. Should their opponent attempt to flee, it only incites the hunter further, spurring them into a relentless pursuit.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

### Savage Orc Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs. 

#### Arrow Monger

* Arrow mongers use their Loose Arrows feature to strike targets with AC 16 or lower.

#### Berserker

* Berserkers unleash reckless attacks whenever they fight an enemy wearing medium or heavy armor (AC 16 or higher). They are not very intelligent and will charge at the first foe in their path.

#### Darkfoots

* Darkfoots target spellcasters, undead, aberrations, and fiends first, seeking to eliminate them before engaging other foes.


#### Stalkers
* Stalkers sneak up on their targets. If multiple enemies are present, they prioritize ranged attackers and spellcasters, attempting to force them into retreat and provoke an opportunity attack.
