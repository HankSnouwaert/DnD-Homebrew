## Orc Infantry

The orcs are a race of savage, muscle-bound barbarians who live for the thrill of battle. Towering over many other races, their hulking forms are a testament to their belief in brute strength as the highest virtue. Orc society is built around combat, and they are always eager to prove their might. This insatiable thirst for violence often leads to constant brawling among their own clans, turning their encampments into chaotic battlegrounds.

Despite their fractious nature, the orcs' relentless fighting spirit can be harnessed by powerful leaders who manage to unite the clans under a single banner. These leaders, often the most formidable and cunning of their kind, can forge disparate groups into mighty war hosts. When united, these orcish armies become an unstoppable force, rivaling the military might of other, more organized races.

Orc weaponry reflects their brutal approach to warfare. Their weapons are crude and especially heavy, designed to maximize the sheer force behind each strike. Regardless of the type—whether axe, polearm, or longbow—these weapons are collectively known as "choppers." Orcs wield these cumbersome instruments with terrifying proficiency, their immense strength allowing them to deliver devastating opening blows that can shatter enemy lines and send foes fleeing in terror.

While their society may seem chaotic and driven by endless infighting, it is precisely this constant state of conflict that hones the orcs into formidable warriors. Their culture of strength ensures that only the toughest survive, and those who emerge as leaders are truly forces to be reckoned with. Whether in the throes of a clan brawl or united in a grand war host, the orcs embody the raw, unrelenting power of a race that lives and breathes for the thrill of battle.

### Orc Brutes

Orc brutes are the epitome of orcish strength and savagery. These towering behemoths stand head and shoulders above their kin, their massive frames rippling with muscle and scarred from countless battles. Born with a natural advantage in size and ferocity, orc brutes quickly rise through the brutal ranks of orc society by sheer force. Their imposing presence and unmatched strength allow them to clobber their way to positions of power, commanding respect and fear from lesser orcs.

 These brutes are not only larger and meaner, but also possess a relentless drive to prove their superiority. This often places them at the forefront of battles, where they lead charges with their devastating choppers, inspiring their kin with their fearsome prowess. Their sheer might and unyielding brutality make them natural leaders in orcish warbands, often serving as the muscle behind the warlord's command, ensuring that the other orcs stay in line through intimidation and sheer strength.

Orc brutes are the backbone of any formidable orc war host, their presence turning the tide of battle through sheer force of will and power. Their ability to endure and dish out incredible amounts of punishment makes them invaluable assets in prolonged conflicts, where their relentless aggression can wear down even the most resilient enemies.

### Orc Archers

Orc archers, known for their surprising skill with longbows, occupy a peculiar niche within orc society. These sharpshooters are often viewed with suspicion and distrust by their kin, as ranged combat is considered sneaky and cowardly by most orcs. Despite this disdain, the practical value of orc archers cannot be denied. Their ability to rain down a hail of arrows on enemies from a distance provides a tactical advantage that even the most battle-hungry orc warlords recognize.

While orc archers are generally tolerated for their utility, they are also keenly aware of the contempt their brethren hold for them. Insults and slights are rarely made within earshot, as tales abound of those who dared to mock an archer only to be found later with an arrow through their neck. This underlying tension creates a volatile environment where orc archers must constantly prove their worth and strength, both on the battlefield and within their own ranks, ensuring that they remain a force to be reckoned with despite the disdain of their fellow orcs.

### Orc Hole Puncher
Orc hole punchers are a fearsome subset of orc archers, distinguished by their use of especially heavy and powerful longbows. These massive weapons require immense draw strength, something only the most robust and skilled orcs can muster. The arrows fired by hole punchers strike with incredible power, capable of piercing through armor and even shields, making them a deadly threat on the battlefield.

The reputation of orc hole punchers extends beyond their physical prowess. Their ability to deliver devastating shots from a distance earns them a grudging respect even from those who disdain ranged combat. While they share the general mistrust faced by all orc archers, their undeniable effectiveness ensures they are valued members of any war host. The orcs know that underestimating a hole puncher can be a fatal mistake, as these powerful archers can turn the tide of battle with a well-placed, bone-shattering shot.

#### Orc Soldier Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs. 

##### Orcs and Orc Brutes
&emsp;**Aggressive:** Utilize their aggressive trait to bypass front lines and target vulnerable backline characters.

**Choppers:** Their first attack bonus makes them effective against high AC targets with low hit points, maximizing initial impact.

##### Orc Archers and Hole Punchers

&emsp;**Positioning:** Maintain distance to engage vulnerable targets with ranged attacks.

**Tactical Movement:** In ranged firefights, use the Aggressive trait to close distances and engage in melee, overwhelming opposing ranged attackers.

**Pre-Melee Action (Hole Puncher only):** Before moving into melee, use their *Devastating Draw* ability, if available, to maximize damage output.

The weapon loses its draw if the orc is no longer using both hands to hold the weapon, is knocked prone, grappled, restrained, or loses concentration on it (as if concentrating on a spell). When the orc makes an attack with the weapon, it consumes the draw and gets +1 to hit and deals an additional 13 (3d8) damage on hit.

## Iron Orcs

Iron orcs are an elite subrace of orcs <br> shrouded in mystery, their origins <br> unknown. Some legends whisper that <br> they were created by a malign empire <br> to serve as slave soldiers, bred for war <br> and obedience. This dark history, <br> whether true or not, has imbued the <br> iron orcs with a unique sense of <br> purpose and a grim determination that <br> sets them apart from their more chaotic <br> kin. 

Unlike their rowdy and wild kin, iron <br> orcs are characterized by their dour and <br> serious demeanor. They approach battle <br> with a level of discipline and focus that <br> is rare among orcs. This seriousness is <br> reflected in their daily lives as well, <br> where frivolity and infighting are kept to <br> a minimum. Iron orcs see themselves as <br> the pinnacle of orcish strength and <br> discipline, and they hold themselves to a <br> higher standard, both on and off the <br> battlefield. This disciplined lifestyle <br> fosters a sense of fierce camaraderie and <br> mutual respect that is uncommon in <br> other orc clans.

### The Immortals
The Immortals are a legendary group of iron orcs, comprised of the most powerful warriors to ever walk the world. Each member of this elite regiment is a battle-scarred veteran, having survived countless conflicts and emerged stronger with each battle. Their ferocity and resilience on the battlefield have earned them a reputation as a nearly unkillable force, feared by enemies and revered by their own kind. The Immortals are known not only for their formidable combat skills but also for their unyielding spirit, making them a symbol of iron orc endurance and might.

The Immortals are adept at quickly replenishing any losses to their ranks. The regiment selects its members from the most elite iron orcs, ensuring that only the best of the best join their ranks. This continuous infusion of top-tier warriors maintains their status as an unbreakable force, seemingly immune to the attrition that affects other military units. Their ranks never diminish for long, and their presence on the battlefield is a testament to the iron orcs' unrelenting pursuit of strength and dominance.

### Iron Orc Tactics

&emsp;**Armed To The Teeth.** Iron orcs choose their weapons based on the composition and characteristics of their enemies:



\columnbreak

* **Pike Chopper:** Selected when facing multiple highly mobile fighters, such as monks or rogues, to counteract their agility.

* **Greataxe Chopper:** Preferred against classes that rely on a few powerful attacks, such as paladins, barbarians, and rogues, to maximize damage during encounters.

* **Mace Chopper:** Effective against spellcasters, especially those concentrating on high-level spells, to disrupt their casting and focus.

**Fighting In Larger Forces.** The role of an iron orc is to disrupt foes to allow other orcs to deal more damage. If there are multiple iron orcs, each one can pick a different weapon mastery and focus on disrupting specific players, generally prioritizing the players with the most health. (Note: Why the ones with the most heat?)


**Crimson Spiller Tactics.** These orcs will prefer whichever weapon can hit two or more targets simultaneously, leveraging area-of-effect attacks for greater efficiency compared to multiple single-target attacks.

**Immortal Tactics.** The Immortals are known for their adaptability. When ***Da New Plan*** is triggered, it is used as an opportunity to change up their strategy and adapt to how the fight's going.

## Choppers

Choppers are crude and hefty weapons favored by many orcish clans. An orc's strength allows them to wield these weapons with brutal efficiency, whereas many other species would struggle to even lift them. Although they can deliver devastating blows, their bulky nature makes them cumbersome to wield. Orcs refer to any weapon with these traits as a chopper, whether a massive war maul or a mighty longbow requiring tremendous strength to draw. 


### Chopper Weapon Trait
Any weapon can have the Chopper trait added to it, which grants it the following features:

* If it has the Finesse or Thrown properties, it loses them.

* When a creature makes an attack for the first time on its turn with a Chopper weapon, it gets a -1 penalty on that attack roll and deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

* The weapon gains the Heavy trait, if it doesn't already have it and, the weapon's weight is doubled.

* Attacks made with the weapon suffer distadvantage due to its hefty nature unless the creature wielding it has a Strength score of 13 or higher.

* When you make an attack for the first time on your turn with a Chopper weapon, you get a +1 bonus to the attack instead of a -1 penalty.
