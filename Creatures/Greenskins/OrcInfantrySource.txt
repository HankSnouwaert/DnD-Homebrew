## Orc Infantry

The orcs are a race of savage, muscle-bound barbarians who live for the thrill of battle. Towering over many other races, their hulking forms are a testament to their belief in brute strength as the highest virtue. Orc society is built around combat, and they are always eager to prove their might. This insatiable thirst for violence often leads to constant brawling among their own clans, turning their encampments into chaotic battlegrounds.

Despite their fractious nature, the orcs' relentless fighting spirit can be harnessed by powerful leaders who manage to unite the clans under a single banner. These leaders, often the most formidable and cunning of their kind, can forge disparate groups into mighty war hosts. When united, these orcish armies become an unstoppable force, rivaling the military might of other, more organized races.

Orc weaponry reflects their brutal approach to warfare. Their weapons are crude and especially heavy, designed to maximize the sheer force behind each strike. Regardless of the type—whether axe, polearm, or longbow—these weapons are collectively known as "choppers." Orcs wield these cumbersome instruments with terrifying proficiency, their immense strength allowing them to deliver devastating opening blows that can shatter enemy lines and send foes fleeing in terror.

While their society may seem chaotic and driven by endless infighting, it is precisely this constant state of conflict that hones the orcs into formidable warriors. Their culture of strength ensures that only the toughest survive, and those who emerge as leaders are truly forces to be reckoned with. Whether in the throes of a clan brawl or united in a grand war host, the orcs embody the raw, unrelenting power of a race that lives and breathes for the thrill of battle.

### Orc Brutes

Orc brutes are the epitome of orcish strength and savagery. These towering behemoths stand head and shoulders above their kin, their massive frames rippling with muscle and scarred from countless battles. Born with a natural advantage in size and ferocity, orc brutes quickly rise through the brutal ranks of orc society by sheer force. Their imposing presence and unmatched strength allow them to clobber their way to positions of power, commanding respect and fear from lesser orcs.

 These brutes are not only larger and meaner, but also possess a relentless drive to prove their superiority. This often places them at the forefront of battles, where they lead charges with their devastating choppers, inspiring their kin with their fearsome prowess. Their sheer might and unyielding brutality make them natural leaders in orcish warbands, often serving as the muscle behind the warlord's command, ensuring that the other orcs stay in line through intimidation and sheer strength.

Orc brutes are the backbone of any formidable orc war host, their presence turning the tide of battle through sheer force of will and power. Their ability to endure and dish out incredible amounts of punishment makes them invaluable assets in prolonged conflicts, where their relentless aggression can wear down even the most resilient enemies.

### Orc Archers

Orc archers, known for their surprising skill with longbows, occupy a peculiar niche within orc society. These sharpshooters are often viewed with suspicion and distrust by their kin, as ranged combat is considered sneaky and cowardly by most orcs. Despite this disdain, the practical value of orc archers cannot be denied. Their ability to rain down a hail of arrows on enemies from a distance provides a tactical advantage that even the most battle-hungry orc warlords recognize.

While orc archers are generally tolerated for their utility, they are also keenly aware of the contempt their brethren hold for them. Insults and slights are rarely made within earshot, as tales abound of those who dared to mock an archer only to be found later with an arrow through their neck. This underlying tension creates a volatile environment where orc archers must constantly prove their worth and strength, both on the battlefield and within their own ranks, ensuring that they remain a force to be reckoned with despite the disdain of their fellow orcs.

### Orc Hole Puncher
Orc hole punchers are a fearsome subset of orc archers, distinguished by their use of especially heavy and powerful longbows. These massive weapons require immense draw strength, something only the most robust and skilled orcs can muster. The arrows fired by hole punchers strike with incredible power, capable of piercing through armor and even shields, making them a deadly threat on the battlefield.

The reputation of orc hole punchers extends beyond their physical prowess. Their ability to deliver devastating shots from a distance earns them a grudging respect even from those who disdain ranged combat. While they share the general mistrust faced by all orc archers, their undeniable effectiveness ensures they are valued members of any war host. The orcs know that underestimating a hole puncher can be a fatal mistake, as these powerful archers can turn the tide of battle with a well-placed, bone-shattering shot.

#### Orc Soldier Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs. 

##### Orcs and Orc Brutes
&emsp;**Aggressive:** Utilize their aggressive trait to bypass front lines and target vulnerable backline characters.

**Choppers:** Their first attack bonus makes them effective against high AC targets with low hit points, maximizing initial impact.

##### Orc Archers and Hole Punchers

&emsp;**Positioning:** Maintain distance to engage vulnerable targets with ranged attacks.

**Tactical Movement:** In ranged firefights, use the Aggressive trait to close distances and engage in melee, overwhelming opposing ranged attackers.

**Pre-Melee Action (Hole Puncher only):** Before moving into melee, use their *Devastating Draw* ability, if available, to maximize damage output.

> ***Aggressive.*** The orc can move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it can see.

> ***Devastating Draw.*** At the end of the orc's turn, it may draw back a two-handed ranged weapon it is holding, giving it devastating power. The weapon loses its draw if the orc is no longer using both hands to hold the weapon, is knocked prone, grappled, restrained, or loses concentration on it (as if concentrating on a spell). When the orc makes an attack with the weapon, it consumes the draw and gets +1 to hit and deals an additional 9 (2d8) damage on hit.

## Choppers

Choppers are crude and hefty weapons favored by many orcish clans. An orc's strength allows them to wield these weapons with brutal efficiency, whereas many other species would struggle to even lift them. Although they can deliver devastating blows, their bulky nature makes them cumbersome to wield. Orcs refer to any weapon with these traits as a chopper, whether a massive war maul or a mighty longbow requiring tremendous strength to draw. 


### Chopper Weapon Trait
Any weapon can have the Chopper trait added to it, which grants it the following features:

* If it has the Finesse or Thrown properties, it loses them.

* When a creature makes an attack for the first time on its turn with a Chopper weapon, it gets a -1 penalty on that attack roll and deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

* The weapon gains the Heavy trait, if it doesn't already have it and, the weapon's weight is doubled.

* Attacks made with the weapon suffer disadvantage due to its hefty nature unless the creature wielding it has a Strength score of 13 or higher.

### New Feat: Chopper Master

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you make an attack for the first time on your turn with a Chopper weapon, you get a +1 bonus to the attack instead of a -1 penalty.
