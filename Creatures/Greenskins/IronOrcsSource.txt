## Iron Orcs

Iron orcs are an elite subrace of orcs <br> shrouded in mystery, their origins <br> unknown. Some legends whisper that <br> they were created by a malign empire <br> to serve as slave soldiers, bred for war <br> and obedience. This dark history, <br> whether true or not, has imbued the <br> iron orcs with a unique sense of <br> purpose and a grim determination that <br> sets them apart from their more chaotic <br> kin. 

Unlike their rowdy and wild kin, iron <br> orcs are characterized by their dour and <br> serious demeanor. They approach battle <br> with a level of discipline and focus that <br> is rare among orcs. This seriousness is <br> reflected in their daily lives as well, <br> where frivolity and infighting are kept to <br> a minimum. Iron orcs see themselves as <br> the pinnacle of orcish strength and <br> discipline, and they hold themselves to a <br> higher standard, both on and off the <br> battlefield. This disciplined lifestyle <br> fosters a sense of fierce camaraderie and <br> mutual respect that is uncommon in <br> other orc clans.

### The Immortals
The Immortals are a legendary group of iron orcs, comprised of the most powerful warriors to ever walk the world. Each member of this elite regiment is a battle-scarred veteran, having survived countless conflicts and emerged stronger with each battle. Their ferocity and resilience on the battlefield have earned them a reputation as a nearly unkillable force, feared by enemies and revered by their own kind. The Immortals are known not only for their formidable combat skills but also for their unyielding spirit, making them a symbol of iron orc endurance and might.

The Immortals are adept at quickly replenishing any losses to their ranks. The regiment selects its members from the most elite iron orcs, ensuring that only the best of the best join their ranks. This continuous infusion of top-tier warriors maintains their status as an unbreakable force, seemingly immune to the attrition that affects other military units. Their ranks never diminish for long, and their presence on the battlefield is a testament to the iron orcs' unrelenting pursuit of strength and dominance.

### Iron Orc Tactics

&emsp;**Armed To The Teeth.** Iron orcs choose their weapons based on the composition and characteristics of their enemies:



\columnbreak

* **Pike Chopper:** Selected when facing multiple highly mobile fighters, such as monks or rogues, to counteract their agility.

* **Greataxe Chopper:** Preferred against classes that rely on a few powerful attacks, such as paladins, barbarians, and rogues, to maximize damage during encounters.

* **Mace Chopper:** Effective against spellcasters, especially those concentrating on high-level spells, to disrupt their casting and focus.

**Fighting In Larger Forces.** The role of an iron orc is to disrupt foes to allow other orcs to deal more damage. If there are multiple iron orcs, each one can pick a different weapon mastery and focus on disrupting specific players, generally prioritizing the players with the most health while allowing other orcs to focus on softer targets. 


**Crimson Spiller Tactics.** These orcs will prefer whichever weapon can hit two or more targets simultaneously, leveraging area-of-effect attacks for greater efficiency compared to multiple single-target attacks.

**Immortal Tactics.** The Immortals are known for their adaptability. When ***Da New Plan*** is triggered, it is used as an opportunity to change up their strategy and adapt to how the fight's going.

## Choppers

Choppers are crude and hefty weapons favored by many orcish clans. An orc's strength allows them to wield these weapons with brutal efficiency, whereas many other species would struggle to even lift them. Although they can deliver devastating blows, their bulky nature makes them cumbersome to wield. Orcs refer to any weapon with these traits as a chopper, whether a massive war maul or a mighty longbow requiring tremendous strength to draw. 


### Chopper Weapon Trait
Any weapon can have the Chopper trait added to it, which grants it the following features:

* If it has the Finesse or Thrown properties, it loses them.

* When a creature makes an attack for the first time on its turn with a Chopper weapon, it gets a -1 penalty on that attack roll and deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

* The weapon gains the Heavy trait, if it doesn't already have it and, the weapon's weight is doubled.

* Attacks made with the weapon suffer disadvantage due to its hefty nature unless the creature wielding it has a Strength score of 13 or higher.

### New Feat: Chopper Master
*Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher*<br>
You've mastered the savage art of wielding choppers and their weight now helps rather than hinders you. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you make an attack for the first time on your turn with a Chopper weapon, you get a +1 bonus to the attack instead of a -1 penalty.
