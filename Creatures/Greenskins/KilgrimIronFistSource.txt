## Killgrim Ironfist
Killgrim Ironfist is a legendary iron orc boss whose origins are as mysterious as they are brutal. A grizzled veteran, Killgrim wandered the wastes with a band of fiercely loyal iron orc warriors, cutting down all who dared to stand in his path. His journey through desolate lands became the stuff of legend as he bested one orc tribe after another, each victory adding to his fearsome reputation. As word of his prowess spread, a following of orcs, monsters, and other creatures began to amass around him, drawn by the promise of battle and the glory of victory under his unstoppable leadership.

Despite the growing horde that followed him, Killgrim Ironfist preferred the company of other iron orcs, whose discipline and strength matched his own. He tolerated the presence of lesser orcs and other creatures only as long as they proved useful in his relentless pursuit of war. A brutal and masterful warrior, Killgrim is scarred from countless battles, with a missing eye that only adds to his terrifying visage. His weapons, said to be magically enhanced by the power of his supernatural rage, allow him to wield his axe with blinding speed, sending hewn limbs flying in every direction as he fights. Killgrim is driven by an insatiable need for combat, never allowing more than a few days to pass without seeking out a new foe to unleash his fury upon. This constant hunger for battle makes him a force of destruction that few can withstand, and his legend continues to grow with each bloody victory.

### Epic Kilgrim Battle
If you wish to make Kilgrim Ironfist into a higher-level threat, increase the temporary hit points granted by his Da Stance feature to 100 and don't have him lose the benefits of a stance when he switches to a new one. These changes increase his Challenge Rating (CR) to 20.

### Killgrim Ironfist Tactics

#### Stances
Killgrim has three stances, each granting 50 temporary hit points when first entered. Kilgrim should not switch stances until these hit points are depleted. Once all stances have been used and no more temporary hit points can be gained, switch to the most effective stance against the current target.

**Basher Stance:** Effective against spellcasters.

**Debilitator Stance:** Great against nearly every martial class.

**Impeder Stance:** Useful against highly mobile fighters such as monks or rogues.


#### Reaction: Deafening Bellow 
Use this reaction against any full spellcaster whenever they are about to cast a spell and have not been hit by an attack from Grim Gore's Basher Stance.

#### Legendary Action: You're Next!
Target those most debilitated by Kilgrims's current stance. If no temporary hit points are left, switch to the most effective stance.

#### Legendary Action: Big Swing
 Use this action if Kilgrim can hit two or more targets. Use this rather than "You're Next!" if there is one target within range with a low Strength save.

>
> ***Multiattack.*** Kilgrim makes two attacks.
>
> ***Gut Slasher.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d12 + 7) slashing damage. If this is the first attack Kilgrim makes on his turn, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage.
>
> ***Wing Puncturing Javelin.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) damage. If the target is flying, Kilgrim has advantage on the attack, and on a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and dazed until the end of its next turn.
> 
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Truculent Dash.*** Kilgrim can move up to his speed toward a hostile creature that he can see without provoking opportunity attacks, ignoring difficult terrain.
> 
> ### Reaction
>
> ***Deafening Bellow.*** When a creature within 120 feet that Kilgrim can see or hear attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell fails and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If the spell was cast using a spell slot, the slot isn't expended.
> 
> ### Legendary Actions
>
> Kilgrim can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Kilgrim regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
>
> ***Check.*** Kilgrim makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Kilgrim is suffering from an effect that allows him to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of his turn, he may immediately make that saving throw with advantage. He can use this legendary action even while incapacitated.
>
> ***You're Next!*** Kilgrim moves up to his speed toward a hostile creature without provoking opportunity attacks, ignoring difficult terrain, and then makes a Gut Slasher attack against it. He cannot target the same creature again with this ability until the end of his next turn.
>
> ***Big Swing (Costs 2 Actions).*** Kilgrim makes a melee attack against each creature within 5 feet of him, with a separate attack roll for each target. If Kilgrim makes only one attack this way, the attack gains advantage, and if it hits, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw, or Kilgrim automatically hits the target with another Gut Slasher attack. If the target fails by 10 or more, the attack is a critical hit.
