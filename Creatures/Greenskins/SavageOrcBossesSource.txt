## Savage Orc Bosses
Among savage orcs, only the fiercest and most devoted warriors ascend to leadership, assuming the mantle of Big Boss. These hulking zealots lead through sheer brutality and unshakable faith, charging headlong into combat without elaborate strategy. Amid roars of crude commands and savage war cries, they carve a bloody path through enemy lines. Their overwhelming might and primal conviction embolden their followers, reducing what would be bone-shattering blows to little more than a passing sting.

Savage orc bosses guide their tribes on massive hunts and merciless raids. So long as they satisfy their warriorsâ€™ need for slaughter and retain the blessing of shamans or prophets, they remain unchallenged. Their rule is held in brutal reverence, reinforced by vivid tales of triumphant battles. Should they ever lose favor or fail to spill enough blood, would-be rivals swiftly emerge, eager to seize power for themselves.



### Savage Orc War Bosses
Those bosses who unite multiple tribes under their banner earn the fearsome title of War Boss. Their sheer ferocity pushes their hordes into a destructive frenzy, and only through iron might and a boundless thirst for conflict can they command such sprawling forces. Their influence is so overwhelming that even more disciplined orcs are drawn into the wave of brutality these warlords generate, forsaking caution in favor of unchecked aggression. In the wake of such a primeval paragon, the civilized world burns.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

### Savage Orc Boss Tactics
Below are some tactical tips to keep in mind when utilizing these orcs.
* War Surge should be used as soon as possible.
* Triggering Savage Resilience using greataxe attacks is a priority. If the orc boss cannot use its Savage Resilience on its turn, its minions will try to knock a target prone or use the Help action to give it advantage on its next turn.
