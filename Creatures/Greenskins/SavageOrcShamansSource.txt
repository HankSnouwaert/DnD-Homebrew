## Savage <Br> Orc Shamans
*Bizarre Practitioners of Primal Magics*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Hills, <Br> Mountains, Underdark; <br>**Treasure:** Individual, Relics <br>
Adorned with bizarre trinkets crudely carved from <bR> bone  and wood, their arms lined with dozens of bangles, <br> and their bodies streaked with outlandish tattoos, the savage orc shaman is an unmistakable figure. Their heads are crowned with towering feathered headdresses or gnarled ceremonial masks, making them impossible to overlook.

Yet, beyond their bombastic appearance, savage orc shamans demand attention through their wild antics—performing ritualistic dances, babbling in tongues, or scattering strange mystical dust and peculiar charms throughout their surroundings. These eccentric displays are far more bizarre and last much longer than the rituals of their more conventional orcish counterparts.

While regular orcs might find such behavior off-putting or even embarrassing, savage orc tribes revere their shamans, viewing their spasming prophets with religious awe. No one, not even the mightiest orcish warboss, dares to challenge the authority of a savage orc shaman. These holy conduits provide the tribe’s warriors with sacred war paints, which render those who bear them nearly impervious to attack.

Beyond this, the shamans are seen as direct voices of the gods. When even a shred of tangible wisdom or meaning can be deciphered from their incoherent ramblings, the tribe treats it as absolute gospel—indisputable and sacred. And when a shaman's addled mind suddenly fixates on a goal, they will pursue it with unyielding determination, leading their devoted followers in relentless pursuit of their divine vision.

When battle erupts, a tribe led by a savage orc shaman becomes a force to be reckoned with. The raw, truculent energies that fuel orcish spellcasting are even more potent among savage orcs, allowing their shamans to harness immense power for their devastating incantations.

As the conflict rages, the shaman appears lost in its own wild antics, seemingly oblivious to the chaos around it. However, enemies who mistake this for foolishness soon realize the truth—these bizarre acts emanate maddening energy that grips nearby orcs, driving them into a frenzy. This unrelenting madness only further amplifies the shaman’s destructive spells.

### Beast Shamans
Among the Savage Orcs, some tribes still hunt primeval titans in the name of their gods. Many shamans craft sacred icons from the horns and tusks of these mighty beasts, adorning themselves with these relics to channel spells of bestial might.

Some shamans who follow this path can empower their followers with spectral claws and fangs, while others unleash howling cries that awaken a feral bloodlust within their allies. A rare few possess the ability to transform into primordial monsters, swatting aside their foes with raw power.

### Orc Shaman Tactics

Orc shamans focus on using their spells to disrupt other spell casters, limit enemy movement, and grant boosts to the combat powers of their allies. They should stay close to their allies in combat to gain the boost to their War Channeler trait. They should avoid unnecessary movement so they can maintain their Mumbo Jumbo Dance, as any attack actions made with the quicked condition contribute to their War Channeler ability.

#### Default Spell Usage

&emsp;**Stomping Foot:** Great opening move to force grouped enemies to spread out into unfavorable positions. Focus on prone creatures to gain bonus damage. Minions should use the shove action on their turns to knock creatures prone.

**Here We Go!:** Cast immediately if there are companions of CR 2 or higher and if it can hit two or more targets with the Stomping Foot spell. Definitely cast if there is an orc boss or warboss among the group.

**Arcane Hand:** If *foot of the gods* is not available, use this concentration spell. Primarily used to grab backline opponents and drag them into melee combat.

**Headbutt:** Use to break the concentration of enemy spellcasters. Priority over all other spells if an opposing spellcaster is concentrating on a higher-level spell than the Shaman can cast.

**Brain Burster:** Use frequently to disrupt enemy spellcasters.

**Brutal Glare:** Use whenever you can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity and do not have a 5th or higher level spell available.

\columnbreak

&emsp; **Savage Fists:** Use when the lesser orc shaman has been cornered in combat.

#### Beast Shaman Spell Usage

**Pass Without Trace:** Ideally cast before combat begins to avoid detection.

**Aspect of the Beast:** Typically cast on the orc’s most powerful ally. Ripping Jaws is generally the most effective option for orcs.

**Howl of the Pack:** Used on the second turn, after all savage orcs are no longer quickened.

**Amber Spear:** Best cast when there’s an opportunity to hit two or more targets.

**Primal Dominance:**  The shaman will use this spell whenever a valid target is available.

**Heroism:** Can be used to bolster either other orcs or the shaman themselves.

**Monstrous Transformation:** Activated when the shaman’s health drops below half, and once transformed, it rarely reverts to its original form mid-combat. While the transformed shaman cannot cast spells, any ongoing magical effects remain active. 

Possible transformations include:

* **Manticore:** Preferred when enemies lack strong ranged attacks.
* **Hydra:** Chosen against foes with low damage output or those unable to concentrate attacks on the transformed orc.
* **Dragon:** Ideal when enemies are grouped together, allowing the dragon’s breath to strike multiple targets. Also useful against foes with high elemental damage.

### New Orcish Spells

####  Brain Burster
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d8 psychic  damage, and until the end of your next turn, it has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma  checks, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration. 
Additionally, if the creature  attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher before the end of your next turn, it must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot or other resource, the slot or resource isn’t expended.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

####  Brutal Glare
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You fixate on two points within the spell's range, no more than 30 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of glowing force erupt from your eyes, blazing between the two points. Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 force damage. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d10, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Foot of The Gods
*7th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer

You call forth a massive foot from the heavens to crash down onto the battlefield. You select a point you can see, between 30 to 500 feet above you within range. A 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide foot appears at the chosen point and immediately descends. The foot passes through any Huge or smaller creatures and objects until it descends 500 feet or hits a solid surface, or a Gargantuan creature or object, at which point the foot rises back up into the sky to where its descent started. As an action on your turn, you can move the foot up to 30 feet, rotate it, and then have the foot descend in the same way.

Each creature or object the foot comes in contact with while descending must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so. The creature is also pushed along with the foot until it rises back up. If a creature that fails the saving throw is already prone, it takes an additional 2d12 bludgeoning damage.

- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Paladin, Ranger, Warlock

You chant, imbuing yourself and up to three creatures you can see with fighty energy. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you or a creature you chose misses with an unarmed strike or weapon attack roll, you may have it reroll the attack. The creature must use the new roll.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 4.

A disruptive bolt of energy emanates from your head toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. The attack has advantage and cannot have disadvantage if the target is concentrating on a spell. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage. If the creature makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, you may choose to set the saving throw DC equal to your spell save DC.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

___

- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Druid, Ranger

Your fists become as hard as iron, and you are filled with fighting fury. When you cast this spell, you make an unarmed strike and gain the following benefits for the duration of the spell:

* You can use your spellcasting modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

* You can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

* You may use your spellcasting modifier when making Strength checks instead of your Strength modifier.

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Aspect of the Beast

*4th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

#### Call of the Pack

*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Ranger
___

Unleashing a primal howl, you stir the wild fervor within your allies. You and up to three other creatures you are aware of within range that can hear you are quickened until the start of your next turn. While quickened this way, these creatures gain advantage on attack rolls against any enemy if at least one of their allies is within 5 feet of that enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated.

#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

\columnbreak

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

#### Primal Dominance

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  10 minutes

___

You emanate a commanding presence, compelling a primal creature to submit. Choose a beast, monstrosity, giant, dragon, or fey within range that can see and hear you. If the creature's Intelligence is 8 or higher, the spell has no effect. Otherwise, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it becomes charmed and frightened by you until the end of your next turn. Regardless of the save's outcome, you gain a +5 bonus to Charisma (Intimidation) and Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks when interacting with that creature until the spell concludes.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
