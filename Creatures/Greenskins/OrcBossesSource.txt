## Orc Bosses
Orc bosses are the most powerful orcs in their society, having clobbered their way to the top of the brutal hierarchy that governs orcish tribes. Through sheer strength and ruthless cunning, they command mobs of lesser orcs, enforcing their will with an iron fist. Their rise to power is a testament to their ability to dominate, and only the toughest, most ferocious orcs can earn the title of boss. These leaders are constantly on the lookout for the next battle, driving their tribes into a frenzy as they seek out new foes to conquer and lands to ravage.

Orcs who manage to command entire tribes are known as big bosses, while the mightiest of these leaders, who control vast tribes or even collections of tribes, earn the fearsome title of war bosses.  These warlords are the pinnacle of orcish power, capable of uniting large numbers of orcs under their banner and leading them into massive, devastating conflicts. A war boss's presence on the battlefield can inspire great surges of violence among their warriors, turning even the most disorganized mobs into a terrifying force of destruction.

&emsp; However, the orc hierarchy is rarely stable, and only the most brutal and cunning bosses can maintain their position for long. The moment a boss shows any sign of weakness or fails to lead their tribe to another victory, their reign is in jeopardy. Orcs respect power above all else, and a boss who cannot deliver victory is seen as unfit to lead. This leads to a constant threat of challengers rising up to dethrone them or the tribe descending into chaos as infighting breaks out. For an orc boss, maintaining control is a relentless struggle, where survival depends on their ability to continuously prove their strength and keep their tribe focused on the next great battle.


***Iron Orc Bosses.*** Iron orc bosses are the ultimate embodiment of discipline and strength within orcish society. Unlike their more chaotic kin, these leaders rise to power through a combination of brutal force and calculated strategy, commanding the respect and fear of their followers. Iron orc bosses are known for their unwavering focus and their ability to maintain order among even the most unruly orc mobs. They are meticulous in their preparations for battle, ensuring that their warriors are well-equipped and trained to perfection. These bosses are not only powerful combatants but also shrewd tacticians, capable of leading their iron orc tribes to victory through both brute strength and disciplined coordination. Their leadership is often more stable than that of other orc bosses, as they inspire loyalty through their unmatched prowess and the respect they command from their equally disciplined kin.

***Iron Orc Mega Warbosses.*** The iron orc mega warboss is the most brutal master of hand-to-hand combat among orc kind, capable of sizing up their foes and cutting them down with a single, devastating swing of their massive weapon. With a war cry that echoes for miles, the warboss summons iron orcs from across the land, forming a massive army ready to sweep away any settlement or opposing force foolish enough to stand in their path. 

Campaigns led by these mega warbosses become the stuff of legends, their conquests etched into the annals of history as tales of unmatched savagery and power.

### Orc Boss and Orc Warboss Tactics
* Battle Cry and War Surge should be used as soon as possible.
* Recharging the Battle Cry using greataxe attacks is a priority. If the orc boss cannot recharge its Battle Cry on its turn, its minions will try to knock a target prone or use the Help action to give it advantage on its next turn.

\columnbreak

### Iron Orc Boss Tactics
* Follow the same tactics as a regular iron orc.
* Use Brutal Encouragement whenever a creature is suffering from an effect that prevents it from attacking.
* Use Change Da Plan whenever the opponent adapts to the orc's tactics.

## Choppers

Choppers are crude and hefty weapons favored by many orcish clans. An orc's strength allows them to wield these weapons with brutal efficiency, whereas many other species would struggle to even lift them. Although they can deliver devastating blows, their bulky nature makes them cumbersome to wield. Orcs refer to any weapon with these traits as a chopper, whether a massive war maul or a mighty longbow requiring tremendous strength to draw. 


### Chopper Weapon Trait
Any weapon can have the Chopper trait added to it, which grants it the following features:

* If it has the Finesse or Thrown properties, it loses them.

* When a creature makes an attack for the first time on its turn with a Chopper weapon, it gets a -1 penalty on that attack roll and deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

* The weapon gains the Heavy trait, if it doesn't already have it and, the weapon's weight is doubled.

* Attacks made with the weapon suffer disadvantage due to its hefty nature unless the creature wielding it has a Strength score of 13 or higher.

### New Feat: Chopper Master
*Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher*<br>
You've mastered the savage art of wielding choppers and their weight now helps rather than hinders you. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you make an attack for the first time on your turn with a Chopper weapon, you get a +1 bonus to the attack instead of a -1 penalty.
