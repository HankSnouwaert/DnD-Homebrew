## Orc Shamans
Orc shamans are the strange, revered spiritual leaders of orcish society, believed to channel the raw will of their gods. Unlike most orcs, whose strength lies in brute force, shamans wield the unpredictable and violent magic of the orcish pantheon. Their role as intermediaries between the mortal realm and the gods makes them both respected and feared, for their powers are mysterious and often uncontrollable. As the orcs wage war, the shamans draw upon the aggressive psychic energy that permeates the battlefield, fueled by the bloodlust of their kin. To the orcs, war is the highest form of worship, and it is through this divine carnage that the shamans perform their most powerful feats of magic.

The magic wielded by orc shamans is chaotic and devastating. They can unleash blasts of psychic energy capable of bursting the brains of their enemies or driving other orcs into even greater heights of bloodthirsty violence. In some cases, shamans are able to summon the wrath of the gods themselves, such as calling forth a giant spectral foot to crush their foes—a manifestation of the gods' direct intervention. This violent magic makes shamans formidable on the battlefield, and they often lead orc warbands into battle with a fervor unmatched by any warrior, their very presence stoking the bloodlust of the horde around them.

However, the connection to their gods often leaves orc shamans exhibiting strange and awkward behaviors that make other orcs uncomfortable. While the shamans are powerful, their bizarre mannerisms—such as babbling incoherently, emitting strange noises, or randomly dancing around while flapping their arms—are seen as eccentric at best. Orcs, who prize straightforward strength and aggression, often don’t know how to react to these odd displays. Despite this, shamans are tolerated, as their magical abilities and perceived favor from the gods make them too valuable to dismiss. While other orcs might roll their eyes or grumble under their breath at a shaman’s antics, they know better than to voice their discomfort openly. The power these shamans wield far outweighs their odd behavior, and their connection to the orcish gods demands a level of respect, however begrudging.

### Orc Shaman Tactics

Orc shamans focus on using their spells to disrupt other spell casters, limit enemy movement, and grant boosts to the combat powers of their allies. They should stay close to their allies in combat to gain the boost to their War Channeler trait.

#### Spell Usage

&emsp;**Stomping Foot:** Great opening move to force grouped enemies to spread out into unfavorable positions. Focus on prone creatures to gain bonus damage. Minions should use the shove action on their turns to knock creatures prone.

**Here We Go:** Cast immediately if there are companions of CR 2 or higher and if it can hit two or more targets with the Stomping Foot spell. Definitely cast if there is an orc boss or warboss among the group.

**Arcane Hand:** If *foot of the gods* is not available, use this concentration spell. Primarily used to grab backline opponents and drag them into melee combat.

**Eadbuta:** Use to break the concentration of enemy spellcasters. Priority over all other spells if an opposing spellcaster is concentrating on a higher-level spell than the Shaman can cast.

**Brain Burst:** Use frequently to disrupt enemy spellcasters.

**Brutal Stare:** Use whenever you can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity and do not have a 5th or higher level spell available.

**Savage Firsts:** Use when the lesser orc shaman has been cornered in combat.

## Lore of Orcs
This magic is commonly used by orcish war <br> shamans who draw psychic power from the <br> aggression of brutal combat. Much of it is psionic <br> in nature and specializes  in disrupting other enemy spellcasters and enhancing the combat powers of <br> the caster and their allies. Orcish shamans believe <br> these powers are drawn from the spirit  of their war <br> gods, and the most powerful of these spells seem to <br> even partially manifest their god's presence on the <br> battlefield. The following spells are examples of the <br> types of magic users of this orcish magic wield, though, depending on the setting, these spells could be utilized by other races as well.

####  Brain Burster
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

You reach into the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 2d8 psychic  damage, and until the end of your next turn, it has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma  checks, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration. 
Additionally, if the creature  attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher before the end of your next turn, it must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot or other resource, the slot or resource isn’t expended.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

####  Brutal Glare
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer

You fixate on two points within the spell's range, no more than 30 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of glowing force erupt from your eyes, blazing between the two points. Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d10 force damage. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the force damage increases by 1d10, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Foot of The Gods
*7th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer

You call forth a massive foot from the heavens to crash down onto the battlefield. You select a point you can see, between 30 to 500 feet above you within range. A 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide foot appears at the chosen point and immediately descends. The foot passes through any Huge or smaller creatures and objects until it descends 500 feet or hits a solid surface, or a Gargantuan creature or object, at which point the foot rises back up into the sky to where its descent started. As an action on your turn, you can move the foot up to 30 feet, rotate it, and then have the foot descend in the same way.

Each creature or object the foot comes in contact with while descending must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and can't stand up until the end of its next turn unless it uses all of its movement to do so. The creature is also pushed along with the foot until it rises back up. If a creature that fails the saving throw is already prone, it takes an additional 2d12 bludgeoning damage.

####  Here We Go!
*5th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action.
- **Range:** 60 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Paladin, Ranger, Warlock

You chant, imbuing yourself and up to four creatures you can see with fighty energy. Until the start of your next turn, whenever you or a creature you chose misses with an unarmed strike or weapon attack roll, you may have it reroll the attack. The creature must use the new roll.

#### Mind Spike (Revised)
*2nd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

Choose one creature that you have seen or heard within the last minute. If that creature is within range, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d10 psychic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Additionally, on a failed save, you always know the target's location until the spell ends, but only while the two of you are on the same plane of existence. While you have this knowledge, the target can’t become hidden from you, and if it’s invisible, it gains no benefit from that condition against you.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Psychic Headbutt
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 ft.
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

A disruptive bolt of energy emanates from your head toward a creature of your choice within range. Make a melee spell attack against the target. The attack has advantage and cannot have disadvantage if the target is concentrating on a spell. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage. If the creature makes a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, you may choose to set the saving throw DC equal to your spell save DC.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.




#### Savage Fists
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Druid, Ranger

Your fists become as hard as iron, and you are filled with fighting fury. When you cast this spell, you make an unarmed strike and gain the following benefits for the duration of the spell:

* You can use your spellcasting modifier for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes, and you can roll a d6 in place of the normal damage of your unarmed strike. If you aren't wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8.

* You can make an unarmed strike as a bonus action.

* You may use your spellcasting modifier when making Strength checks instead of your Strength modifier.
