# Otters

These semi-aquatic creatures are known for their playful antics and slippery agility.  With their thick, water proof coats and ability to hold their breath for long periods of time, otters are well suited to spending their <br> days in the water, and deep diving for food. <br> The otter's small, cute appearance belies its formidable hunting and foraging prowess. Though otters usually don't threaten humanoids, their speed, <br> intelligence, and powerful bite makes them more <br> dangerous than they would appear.  With their keen<Br> eyesight and aquatic agility, otters are deadly hunters, <Br>and in some cases, even the apex predators of their environment.  

## River Otters

The majority of otters are fresh water dwellers.  Equipped with long, slick bodies and powerful tails, river otters can be as small as 2 feet long and 2 pounds in weight to as large as 6 feet long and 100 pounds in weight.  Though they are generally not aggressive towards humanoids, they can be ferocious if provoked or if they view someone, as prey.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **Pack Hunters.** Although river otters can hunt for small creatures on their own, many have been known to coordinate their attacks in pairs or larger groups.  Often times, this involves cooperative fishing efforts, as otters work together to direct fish towards their pack mates.  Sometimes their pack hunting can also be used to bring down larger creatures that would otherwise be beyond the capabilities of a single river otter.  

**Giant River Otters.** While most river otters are too small to be of much threat to larger, humanoid sized creatures, some reach much greater sizes and are capable of hunting larger prey.  The largest of these river otters are the aptly named giant river otters. Individually, they may not seem formidable, but they are the apex predators of their environment, and when hunting as a pack, giant river otters are capable of bringing down fearsome creatures such as caimans and anacondas.

**Wolf Otters.** These ancient creatures are the largest otters to have ever lived.  True to their name, wolf otters can grow to the size of a wolf.  With a bite force equivalent to a bear, these primeval creatures have a wider range of prey options at their disposal.  

While not commonly known to most folk, wolf otters make effective patrol and hunting animals when working with druids or other powerful beings of nature who live near remote riverways.  A pack of aggressive wolf otters can easily spell doom for a group of inexperienced explorers trespassing through their territory.

## Sea Otters

By far the most divergent of all the otters, these creatures have adapted to living their lives almost entirely at sea.  Unlike most other otters, sea otters are adapted to living in salt water environments near coastlines.  They can reach lengths of nearly 5 feet and weigh up to 100 pounds, but they lack the long powerful tails of other otters.  Despite their relatively large size and powerful bite, sea otters generally don't pose a threat to humanoids and other larger creatures unless severely provoked.

**Awkward Walkers.** Sea otters have adapted to spending nearly all of their lives out at sea, and don't move nearly as well over land as other otters.  Rather than coming ashore to rest, sea otters spend their days resting on their backs.  When they need to sleep, they will link arms with other sea otters to ensure they don't drift out to sea.

**Tool Users.** Sea otters don't hunt in aggressive packs for fast moving targets like other otters.  Clams, crustaceans  and other sea dwelling invertebrates make up the majority of their diet.  In order to penetrate the tough shells many of these creatures possess, sea otters learn how to use stones bash through the hardened defenses of their prey.  Sea otters can often be seen resting on their back at the ocean surface, with their latest catch perched on their stomach, bashing away at the soon-to-be meal.

> ##### Otters as Familiars
> **River Otters** and **Sea Otters** may both be used as familiar options using the *Find Familiar* spell. If a **Sea Otter** is used this way, it may still use its Rock attack option against objects.

## Thieving Otter
These strange and often infuriating creatures look similar to ordinary otters, but the evidence of their fey origin is obvious at a glance.  They are often exotic shades of blue, pink, or purple, and usually sport additional flair such as fins or feathery mohawks.  There is also an unmistakable, mischievous intelligence that gleams in their eyes. Thieving otters earn their name from their notorious penchant for robbing other creatures blind, and they possess a number of magical abilities that allow them to do so with ease.  

**Rift Walkers.**  Not only do thieving otters possess the seemingly supernatural ability to avoid being grabbed or restrained, they are also able to create small, short range rifts that allow them to quickly teleport between locations.  

This allows them to appear seemingly out of no where, grab their desired items, and disappear before anyone can respond. Only other otters can traverse these rifts, and an entire pack of otters can travel in and out of a rift in the blink of an eye, allowing them to go on high speed raids. 

**Fey Thieves For Hire.** Thieving otters form packs that roam rivers running through the feywild and near fey crossings, always looking for their next big score.  Though their behavior appears chaotic and impulsive, they are often acting on the behalf of equally chaotic and impulsive fey lords. Some thieving otter packs act as the feywild equivalent of thief's guilds, working as burglars for hire on behalf of other powerful and afluent fey nobles.  Travelers are among their favorite targets, but a wily adventurer with something to offer may be able to bargan with or even hire a pack of thieving otters.

>
> **Nimble Thief.** The otter can take a disengage action, a hide action, a use an object action, or make a Dexterity (Slight of Hand) check as a bonus action on each of its turns. 
> ___
> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) piercing damage.  If it hits a creature, the otter may make a Dexterity (Slight of Hand) check contested by a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check from the target creature.  If the creature fails the check, the otter may steal a small object of its choice that the target is holding or carrying on its person.
>
> ***Aquatic Rift (Recharges after a short or long rest).*** The otter creates an invisible and immobile rift at an unoccupied point it can see within 5 feet of it that is submerged in water. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 60 feet of it that the 
otter can see or specify by distance and direction (such as "60 feet straight up"). While next to the rift, the otter can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the otter puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only otters can use the rift, and the rift lasts for 10 minutes, or until part of the rift is no longer submerged in water.
