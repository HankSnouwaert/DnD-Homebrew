# Toads
These tiny amphibians somehow appear both unassuming and ominous.  Though they pose little threat on their own, toads are often associated with witchcraft and dark curses.  These associations often cause toads to be viewed through the lens of superstitious folklore, where they are seen as dark omens or as central figures in fairytales.

**Poisonous Nature.** Despite being similar in size and appearance to frogs, toads lack their leaping capabilities and generally walk more than they do hop.  Like frogs, toads also lack any offensive abilities against larger creatures, so they must make up for this lack of mobility with tougher skin which secrets a poison that makes the toads unappealing meals for predators.  This tougher skin also retains water for longer periods of time, allowing the toad to roam further from water than frogs.

Some species of toads are known for having hallucinogenic properties.  Creatures effected by their poison experience vivid visions and even a sense of euphoria.  While these forms of poison may be more exciting or even blissful, they are no less dangerous and can still severely harm any creature foolish enough to lick the toad.

**Knots of Toads.** When groups of toads come together, they are referred to as a knot.  While this typically happens during mating events and is entirely harmless to others, supernatural forces can sometimes lead to the formation of an aggressive knot of toads capable of overwhelming much larger creatures.  While the individual toads of the knot pose little threat, en masse, they engulf their targets, subjecting them to overwhelming amounts of their poisonous secretions.  Knots of toads behaving in this way are often summoned by vengeful witches, hags, druids, or even gods as a supernatural punishment for perceived slights.

**Giant Toads.** While toads are adept at catching and swallowing smaller creatures whole, mundane-sized toads pose little threat to humanoids.  However, this situation changes entirely if the toad becomes significantly larger than the typical humanoid.  Giant toads pose a real and terrifying threat, and many fledgling adventurers have met an early and inglorious end in the belly of one of these beasts.

Some giant toads are created as the result of dark or druidic magic, and they are a favorite pet of hags and a common guardian for druids.  Though they are not malevolent by nature, giant toads view humanoids as the ideal meal-sized creature.  A giant toad won’t hesitate to leap out of hiding after a group of travelers, gulp up the nearest person, and flee with its new meal.

## Hypnotoads

These mysterious toads possess powerful and insidious mind-control powers capable of subjecting those they come into contact with.  With their heightened intelligence and powers of suggestion, hypnotoads can quickly build a following of slavish devotees to help them accomplish their inscrutable goals.  

**Otherworldly Enigmas.** None know of the true origins of the hypnotoad, and many doubt their existence altogether.  They may be the result of an arcane experiment gone awry, the influence of the Far Realm, or an extraterrestrial incursion.  
Regardless of their origin, hypnotoads possess the supernatural ability to dominate the will of creatures they make eye contact with.  The hypnotoad can have many creatures under its control this way, so long as they stay within its vicinity.  The creatures under the hypnotoad’s control exist in a trance-like state and receive telepathic commands from their new master, which they follow to the letter.

**All Glory to the Hypnotoad.** While hypnotoads possess the power to mentally enslave creatures and use them for whatever means they choose, the goals of the hypnotoad are often inscrutably bizarre.  They will often use their powers to inject themselves into humanoid society, forcing others to accept their presence as they pursue their goals.  These goals might involve taking on a prominent social role in the community, building a traveling entourage of followers, or winning a local contest.  The hypnotoad’s reasons for these pursuits are unknowable, but the creatures under its control are forced to slavishly comply, and they will even throw themselves into harm’s way should anything or anyone threaten their master.

**Giant Hypnotoads.** While most hypnotoads lack physical prowess and rely entirely on their hypnotic abilities, some can grow to monstrous sizes, granting them the ability to overpower and devour those who displease the almighty hypnotoad.  This increased size enhances the hypnotoad’s powers of domination, allowing it to  force creatures to look into its eyes so they may be subjected to its hypnotic control.



Giant hypnotoads have the power to control entire townships and form bizarre cults.  Some may demand to be worshiped as gods, while others may simply elect themselves the town’s mayor.   Whatever their goal, giant hypnotoads accept nothing less than total obedience and will not hesitate to devour those who interfere with their schemes.

## The Gitrog Monster
The Gitrog Monster is a figure of legend, feared by those living in certain remote villages.  The tales surrounding this creature are often vague and contradictory, but they all describe a monstrous lake-dwelling amphibian that feeds on villagers and their livestock.  The presence of the Gitrog Monster in or near a village spells doom for its helpless inhabitants.

**Unknown Number and Orgin.** While the legends refer to a single creature known as the Gitrog Monster, how many of these abominations actually exist is unknown.  It may be a single legendary creature or a rare breed of monstrosities that rarely make their presence overtly known.

The Gitrog’s origin is equally ambiguous.  Because of the striking similarities between their powers and those of the hypnotoad, those who have studied the Gitrog extensively believe that it may have once been a giant hypnotoad.  How it would have gained this level of power and status is unknown.  Perhaps a particularly ancient hypnotoad devoured enough of its followers to grow into an even greater monster.  Or, a hypnotoad may have been warped by strange, eldritch powers from another world.  Whatever the case, the Gitrog’s inscrutable mind betrays no secrets of its past nor plans for its future.

**Cult Followings.** The Gitrog Monster possesses most of the abilities of a giant hypnotoad, albeit at a much higher level of power.  However, the ways in which the Gitrog utilizes its powers differ from its lesser cousins.  Whereas hypnotoads often make themselves publicly known as they take on prominent local positions within a community, the Gitrog remains hidden away from public view.  Though it usually stays out of sight, the weight of the Gitrog’s presence is felt throughout the entire community.  
Rather than inject itself into petty social games, the Gitrog uses its influence to create dark cults with itself at the center.  These cults are formed from inhabitants from any nearby village, and the cult’s members may include those serving purely out of fear or dark pragmatism and desire for power.  Still, other members are true believers in the Gitrog’s greatness, their psyche shattered, leaving them only with the desire to do whatever is necessary to serve their horrific master’s whims.

While poisoned in this way, it also suffers disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. The poisoned creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check to end the effect.
>
> **Hypnotic Gaze.** When a creature starts its turn within 120 feet of the gitrog and is able to see the gitrog's eyes, the gitrog can magically force it to succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the gitrog until the toad dies or until it is on a different plane of existence from the target. Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the gitrog until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the gitrog in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
>
>The charmed creature is under the gitrog's control, can't take reactions, and the gitrog and the target can communicate telepathically with each other over any distance. Whenever the charmed target takes damage or when it starts its turn at least 1 mile away from the gitrog, the target can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. The save can be made no more than once every 24 hours. A target that successfully saves is immune to this gaze for the next hour.

>
> ***Swallow.*** The gitrog makes one bite attack against a medium or smaller target it is grappling.  If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the gitrog, and it takes 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the gitrog's turns. The gitrog can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the gitrog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
