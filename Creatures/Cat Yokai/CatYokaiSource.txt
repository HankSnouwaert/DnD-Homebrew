# Kaibyō

These mystical cats are the subject of many legends and folk tales and are known collectively as kaibyō. There are many types of kaibyō, with a wide range of appearances and powers, though most share some similar characteristics. Most have split tails, strongly independent personalities, and were originally ordinary cats. However, some strange set of circumstances has transformed these once mundane felines into unpredictable supernatural beings.

***Creation of a Kaibyō.*** Though cats are natural creatures, something about their nature draws the attention of occult energies and magic users. They are often in the presence of supernatural phenomena and magic users, and some believe prolonged exposure to these unnatural forces can transform felines into supernatural beings. Some paranoid individuals even believe that a cat who witnesses its master casting spells for too long will eventually learn to wield magic itself and transform itself into a powerful being capable of running amuck on its own.

For these reasons, many believe kaibyō were once the familiars of powerful spellcasters. These cats then gained the power to ascend into a new form through heavy magical exposure or stealing the secrets of spellcraft from their masters. The exact nature of their master’s circumstances and how they ascended are thought to determine the type of kaibyō the cat transformed into.

## Kasha 
This fiend is among the most unique and deadly of all the kaibyo. The kasha appears as a cat engulfed in flames, with sparks flickering off its body, and it speaks with a thunderous voice. Its two tails wildly flicker behind it, blazing like torches, and it is always seen accompanied by a cart made of burning wood and bone, which it can pull through the air amidst thunderstorms. The kasha typically appears during wild storms to snatch up the corpses of recently deceased corpses and drag their souls to the lower planes. 

***Demonic Envoys.***
Once considered to be cats or familiars of spellcasters, the process of how kashas undergo such an unholy transformation is said to be a well-guarded secret. Many believe that to begin the transformation, a cat or familiar must make a pact with an unholy creature on a far more instinctual level, similar to how a warlock would make a pact. Some theories suggest that the creature must be an oni with great sorcerous power, while others say that only the rakshasa hold the knowledge to make these deals. 
There is much evidence to give these theories merit. Kasha often act as envoys, capturing the bodies and souls of powerful and noble heroes, priests, or of powerful spellcasters who have made dealings with dark entities. These souls are brought before cruel masters who use them for their dark purposes. It is said that the kasha is rewarded with whatever remains of the corpse once the soul is delivered.

***Funeral Raiders.***
Kasha are rarely seen on the Material Plane except during the brief moments when they attack. They are often accompanied by black storm clouds and booming thunder, which herald the arrival of this horrible creature. Soon after, the kasha appears among streaks of lightning in the sky, charging with its flaming cart straight for the corpse's resting place. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to intervene will likely find themselves flung along with the corpse into the burning cart and dragged back into the sky. Once the kasha has its prize, along with a few unfortunate bystanders, it vanishes with a crash of thunder, dragging its victims into the depths of the underworld.

### Kasha Tactics
The primary goal of kashas is to retrieve the corpse they have been sent to gather. This means they have no intention of fighting and will gladly grab the corpse and leave without going out of their way to attack anyone. However, kashas will readily cause destruction to anyone who happens to be in the way of their intended target. They may even choose a slightly more destructive path to their corpse, reveling in the carnage they inflict. If a party proves to be a hindrance to a kasha's goal, it will not hesitate to slay them.

***Thunder Step.*** This is the kasha's opening move and how it will start any engagement. The kasha can teleport up to a mile with this ability if it is high in the air. It will teleport to an area where it can do the most damage with the aftershock of its teleport and can follow up with a Burning Charge that will hit the most targets and allow it to land next to the corpse it intends to take.

***Burning Charge.*** The kasha will use this ability every time it can hit two or more targets. Remember, you can use Thunder Step to reposition the kasha to hit the maximum number of targets. This also provides a good escape option, as it allows the kasha to safely disengage from melee enemies. However, remember that the kasha cannot use any other movement on the turn that it uses this bonus action.

***Multiattack.*** The kasha should have to use one of the attacks from Multiattack to grab its desired corpse unless it can run it over with Burning Charge. The pause during which it gathers the corpse should give the players an opportunity to stop it, and if any creatures nearby are being a nuisance, it may use its bite attack on them during this Multiattack. It will also use Multiattack on turns where it has to re-summon its cart. It may also rely on Multiattack if the party spreads out to negate its Thunder Step/Burning Charge combo.

***The Escape Plan.*** Once the kasha has flung the corpse into its cart, it will use Burning Charge to fly high up in the sky, accompanied by a Thunder Step to move even higher. If its cart is constantly being destroyed, it will grab the corpse with one of its attacks and then attempt to dash through the sky. Once it gets high enough to allow its Thunder Step to reach its maximum teleport range, it will summon its cart if necessary before securing its corpse and teleporting away.

> ***Pounce.*** If the kasha jumps at least 10 feet straight towards a creature and then hits it with a Thunder Claw attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The kasha makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the kasha can't attack another target, and it can choose to use Fling instead of a claw attack against the grappled creature.
>
> ***Thunder Step*** While the kasha is within 5ft of its hellcart, the kasha, its hellcart, and each creature inside the hellcart teleport to an unoccupied space within 40 feet that it can see that’s large enough to fit them. Immediately after it teleports, a thunderous boom sounds, and each creature within 10 feet of the hellcart must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the kasha. If it fails by 5 or more, it is knocked prone as well. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away.
>
> If the kasha is 160 feet or more up in the air in stormy weather, the teleport can be heard from a mile away instead.

>
> ***Thunder Fling.*** One Large or smaller creature or object held or grappled by the kasha must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be flung away. A creature flung away is thrown up to 20 feet in the direction of the kasha’s choice, taking 13 (3d8) thunder damage and landing prone. If the target is thrown in the area of the kasha’s hellcart, it’s trapped inside if there’s room.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Burning Charge.*** If the kasha has not moved this turn, it moves up to 40 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature without provoking attacks of opportunity. The first time its hellcart enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13 (3d8) fire damage and is knocked prone. If it fails by 5 or more (DC 12) it is trapped in the cart if there is room. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or trapped. The kasha and its hellcart can't end their movement in another creature's space, and after kasha uses this bonus action, its speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
>
> ***Hellcart.*** The kasha creates a magical cart that is a Large magical object. It has 25 hit points, an AC of 18, and any non-fiend creature or corpse in the cart is grappled and restrained (escape DC 17). A creature that ends its turn in the cart takes 13 (3d8) fire damage. The cart can hold up to four Medium or smaller creatures. The kasha can pull the cart behind it using its tail without losing movement speed and even pull it through the air as it flies. The kasha can only have one cart created at a time, and any cart it has before created before is destroyed if it creates a new one.
