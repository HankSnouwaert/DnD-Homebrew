> ___
>
> ***Keen Sight.*** The kasha has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ***Pounce.*** If the kasha jumps at least 10 feet straight towards a creature and then hits it with a Thunder Claw attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The kasha makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the kasha can't attack another target, and it can choose to use Fling instead of a claw attack against the grappled creature.
>
> ***Thunder Step*** While the kasha is within 5ft of its hellcart, the kasha, its hellcart, and each creature inside the hellcart teleport to an unoccupied space within 40 feet that it can see that’s large enough to fit them. Immediately after it teleports, a thunderous boom sounds, and each creature within 10 feet of the hellcart must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the kasha. If it fails by 5 or more, it is knocked prone as well. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away.
>
> If the kasha is 160 feet or more up in the air in stormy weather, the teleport can be heard from a mile away instead.
>
> ***Fire Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the target is prone, it deals 23 (4d8 + 5) piercing plus 18 (4d8) fire damage instead.
>
> ***Thunder Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) thunder damage.
>
>  **Thunder Fling.** One Large or smaller creature or object held or grappled by the kasha must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be flung away. A creature flung away is thrown up to 20 feet in the direction of the kasha’s choice, taking 13 (3d8) thunder damage and landing prone. If the target is thrown in the area of the kasha’s hellcart, it’s trapped inside if there’s room.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Burning Charge.*** If the kasha has not moved this turn, it moves up to 40 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature without provoking attacks of opportunity. The first time its hellcart enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13 (3d8) fire damage and is knocked prone. If it fails by 5 or more (DC 12) it is trapped in the cart if there is room. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or trapped. The kasha and its hellcart can't end their movement in another creature's space, and after kasha uses this bonus action, its speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
>
> ***Hellcart.*** The kasha creates a magical cart that is a Large magical object. It has 25 hit points, an AC of 18, and any non-fiend creature or corpse in the cart is grappled and restrained (escape DC 17). A creature that ends its turn in the cart takes 13 (3d8) fire damage. The cart can hold up to four Medium or smaller creatures. The kasha can pull the cart behind it using its tail without losing movement speed and even pull it through the air as it flies. The kasha can only have one cart created at a time, and any cart it has before created before is destroyed if it creates a new one.

While in its Tiny cat form, it reduces the damage dice of its weapon attacks by 3 (included in the attacks), makes Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws with advantage, and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with disadvantage. If the nekomata dies, it reverts to its true form.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Shrink Away.*** Nekomata uses its Change Shape to turn into a Tiny cat and takes the Hide action.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Reactive Change.*** At the end of the nekomata's turn, when it's attacked, making an attack, or forced to make a check or saving throw, it can use its Change Shape. If it turns into a Tiny cat this way while being attacked, the attack suffers disadvantage.
