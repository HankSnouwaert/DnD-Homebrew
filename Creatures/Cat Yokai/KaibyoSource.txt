# Kaibyō

These mystical cats are the subject of many legends and folk tales and are known collectively as kaibyō. There are many types of kaibyō, with a wide range of appearances and powers, though most share some similar characteristics. Most have split tails, strongly independent personalities, and were originally ordinary cats. However, some strange set of circumstances has transformed these once mundane felines into unpredictable supernatural beings.

Though all kaibyō have feline appearances, some are shapeshifters capable of altering their form at will. They use these powers to aid them in hunting and deceiving their prey. What may appear to be an ordinary cat, or in some cases, even a personal acquaintance, may, in fact, be a kaibyō. This often results in villages that have been plagued by kaibyō becoming fearful and paranoid of cats, and suspicious of any odd feline behavior. 

***Creation of a Kaibyō.*** Though cats are natural creatures, something about their nature draws the attention of occult energies and magic users. They are often in the presence of supernatural phenomena and magic users, and some believe prolonged exposure to these unnatural forces can transform felines into supernatural beings. Some paranoid individuals even believe that a cat who witnesses its master casting spells for too long will eventually learn to wield magic itself and transform itself into a powerful being capable of running amuck on its own.

For these reasons, many believe kaibyō were once the familiars of powerful spellcasters. These cats then gained the power to ascend into a new form through heavy magical exposure or stealing the secrets of spellcraft from their masters. The exact nature of their master’s circumstances and how they ascended are thought to determine the type of kaibyō the cat transformed into.

## Kasha 
This fiend is among the most unique and <br> deadly of all the kaibyō. The kasha appears as <br> a cat engulfed in flames, with sparks flickering off <br> its body, and it speaks with a thunderous voice. Its <br> two tails wildly flicker behind it, blazing like torches, <br> and it is always seen accompanied by a cart made of <br> burning wood and bone, which it can pull through the air amidst thunderstorms. The kasha typically appears during wild storms to snatch up the corpses of recently deceased corpses and drag their souls to the lower planes. 

***Demonic Envoys.***
Once considered to be cats or familiars of spellcasters, the process of how kasha undergo such an unholy transformation is said to be a well-guarded secret. Many believe that to begin the transformation, a cat or familiar must make a pact with an unholy creature on a far more instinctual level, similar to how a warlock would make a pact. Some theories suggest that the creature must be an oni with great sorcerous power, while others say that only the rakshasa hold the knowledge to make these deals. 
There is much evidence to give these theories merit. Kasha often act as envoys, capturing the bodies and souls of powerful and noble heroes, priests, or of powerful spellcasters who have made dealings with dark entities. These souls are brought before cruel masters who use them for their dark purposes. It is said that the kasha is rewarded with whatever remains of the corpse once the soul is delivered.

***Funeral Raiders.***
Kasha are rarely seen on the Material Plane except during the brief moments when they attack. They are often accompanied by black storm clouds and booming thunder, which herald the arrival of this horrible creature. Soon after, the kasha appears among streaks of lightning in the sky, charging with its flaming cart straight for the corpse's resting place. Any creature foolish enough to attempt to intervene will likely find themselves flung along with the corpse into the burning cart and dragged back into the sky. Once the kasha has its prize, along with a few unfortunate bystanders, it vanishes with a crash of thunder, dragging its victims into the depths of the underworld.

> ***Keen Sight.*** The kasha has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ***Pounce.*** If the kasha jumps at least 10 feet straight towards a creature and then hits it with a Thunder Claw attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The kasha makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the kasha can't attack another target, and it can choose to use thunder fling instead of a claw attack against the grappled creature.
>
> ***Thunder Step*** While the kasha is within 5ft of its hellcart, the kasha, its hellcart, and each creature inside the hellcart teleport to an unoccupied space within 40 feet that it can see that’s large enough to fit them. Immediately after it teleports, a thunderous boom sounds, and each creature within 10 feet of the hellcart must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the kasha. If it fails by 5 or more, it is knocked prone as well. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed. The thunder can be heard from up to 300 feet away.
>
> If the kasha is 160 feet or more up in the air in stormy weather, it can teleport up to one mile away or a different plane of existence instead.
>
> ***Fire Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the target is prone, it deals 23 (4d8 + 5) piercing plus 18 (4d8) fire damage instead.
>
> ***Thunder Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) thunder damage.
>
> ***Thunder Fling.*** One Large or smaller creature or object held or grappled by the kasha must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be flung away. A creature flung away is thrown up to 20 feet in the direction of the kasha’s choice, taking 13 (3d8) thunder damage and landing prone. If the target is thrown in the area of the kasha’s hellcart, it’s trapped inside if there’s room.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Burning Charge.*** If the kasha has not moved this turn, it moves up to 40 feet in a straight line and can move through the space of any Large or smaller creature without provoking attacks of opportunity. The first time its hellcart enters a creature's space during this move, that creature must make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13 (3d8) fire damage and is knocked prone. If it fails by 5 or more (DC 12) it is trapped in the cart if there is room. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or trapped. The kasha and its hellcart can't end their movement in another creature's space, and after kasha uses this bonus action, its speed is 0 until the end of the current turn.
>
> ***Hellcart.*** The kasha creates a magical cart that is a Large magical object. It has 25 hit points, an AC of 18, and any non-fiend creature or corpse in the cart is grappled and restrained (escape DC 17). A creature that ends its turn in the cart takes 13 (3d8) fire damage. The cart can hold up to four Medium or smaller creatures. The kasha can pull the cart behind it using its tail without losing movement speed and even pull it through the air as it flies. The kasha can only have one cart created at a time, and any cart it has before created before is destroyed if it creates a new one.

### Kasha Loot
Because kasha are fiends, most of their bodies will disintegrate when slain on the Material Plane. The valuable items they leave behind are usually in the form of motes of fiendish essence that can be collected in vials and whatever remains of their cart and its grizzly cargo. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Perception)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Carver’s Tools) check to harvest the wood from the remains of their cart.

#### Kasha Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Kasha Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-12  | 1 50gp Item |
|  13-17 | 1 100gp Item | 
|  18-24 | 1d4(2) 100gp Items  |  
|  25+ |  1d4(2) 200gp Items |  
 



#### Example Kasha Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.



##### Example Kasha Item Names
|1d4 | 50gp Item | 100gp Item | 200gp Item | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 <br> (Bone)  |   Cracked Bone of the Damned |  Bone of the Damned |  Pristine Bone of the Damned  |
| 2 <br> (Essence)  | Faded Mote of Hellfire| Mote of Hellfire | Fervorous Mote of Hellfire | 
| 3 <br>(Flesh)  | Rotted Flesh of the Damned| Flesh of the Damned|  Fresh Flesh of the Damned  | 
| 4 <br> (Wood) | Cracked Hellish Timber | Hellish Timber |  Reinforced Hellish Timber |




### Kasha Tactics
The primary goal of kasha is to retrieve the corpse they have been sent to gather. This means they have no intention of fighting and will gladly grab the corpse and leave without going out of their way to attack anyone. However, kasha will readily cause destruction to anyone who happens to be in the way of their intended target. They may even choose a slightly more destructive path to their corpse, reveling in the carnage they inflict. If a party proves to be a hindrance to a kasha's goal, it will not hesitate to slay them.

***Thunder Step.*** This is the kasha's opening move and how it will start any engagement. The kasha can teleport up to a mile with this ability if it is high in the air. It will teleport to an area where it can do the most damage with the aftershock of its teleport and can follow up with a Burning Charge that will hit the most targets and allow it to land next to the corpse it intends to take.

***Burning Charge.*** The kasha will use this ability every time it can hit two or more targets. Remember, you can use Thunder Step to reposition the kasha to hit the maximum number of targets. This also provides a good escape option, as it allows the kasha to safely disengage from melee enemies. However, remember that the kasha cannot use any other movement on the turn that it uses this bonus action.

***Multiattack.*** The kasha should have to use one of the attacks from Multiattack to grab its desired corpse unless it can run it over with Burning Charge. The pause during which it gathers the corpse should give the players an opportunity to stop it, and if any creatures nearby are being a nuisance, it may use its bite attack on them during this Multiattack. It will also use Multiattack on turns where it has to re-summon its cart. It may also rely on Multiattack if the party spreads out to negate its Thunder Step/Burning Charge combo.

***The Escape Plan.*** Once the kasha has flung the corpse into its cart, it will use Burning Charge to fly high up in the sky, accompanied by a Thunder Step to move even higher. If its cart is constantly being destroyed, it will grab the corpse with one of its attacks and then attempt to dash through the sky. Once it gets high enough to allow its Thunder Step to reach its maximum teleport range, it will summon its cart if necessary before securing its corpse and teleporting away.

## Nekomata

The nekomata is a fearsome hunter that stalks the forests of high mountains. It appears as a two-tailed domesticated cat that has reached the size of a tiger and possesses a near-human level intellect. To make matters worse, the nekomata can transform itself back into a regular-sized house cat, allowing it to better sneak up on and deceive its prey.

***Call of the Wild.*** Like other kaibyō, nekomata were once regular house cats. Some say they heard the primeval whispers of their wild ancestors calling them to the deepest wilderness. Others say that they were once familiars of druids who, by living long lives and observing their shape-shifting masters, have learned to shed their own forms. However this transformation occurs, it ultimately ends with a cat delving deep into the wilderness, becoming in the wild's energies, and emerging as a nekomata.

***Apex Hunter.*** Once a cat completes its transformation into a nekomata, it often abandons the trappings of civilization and becomes an apex predator within the deep mountain forests. Others will return to their former masters out of attachment, living their daily lives as ordinary house cats, only to disappear into the night and become wild, vicious predators. They may even bring back their kills to the household. Regardless of nekomata's intent, it devastates local villages and ecosystems, as there are few creature's they can't prey on. Some nekomata even revel in hunting dangerous creatures, such as powerful humanoids.

***Shifting Forms.*** Nekomata can transform into their original house cat form, allowing them to stalk prey more effectively in their tiny form, going unnoticed where larger creatures would be spotted. Even those observant enough to notice the creature believe it is just a house cat following behind them, unaware of the imminent danger. In combat, the ability to suddenly shrink in size can be very effective as it allows the nekomata to dodge mighty blows that would otherwise land. Enemies can also be disoriented by the sudden transformation of a tiny cat into a massive creature, making it difficult to predict where the nekomata's attacks will land.

### Nekomata Tactics
Nekomata use general ambush tactics and hunt like most other big cats. The biggest difference between it and ordinary big cats is its ability to rapidly shift sizes mid-combat. Below are some of the common ways it will make use of this ability:

* The nekomata becomes tiny to stalk the party and figure out which party members will be easiest to pounce on. It may even wait until one party is further away from the rest of the group before ambushing the isolated target. 
* If the nekomata is discovered before it can spring an ambush, it will attempt to pass itself off as an ordinary house cat. If the party is still suspicious of it, it will withdraw and make an attempt to sneak up on the party later.
* When making an ambush from its tiny cat form, the nekomata will initiate with its pounce, becoming large as part of the attack.
* If the nekomata fails to grapple a creature with its Multiattack, it will withdraw and use its Shrink Away feature to retreat into hiding before setting up another surprise attack.
* Nekomata typically saves its reactions to use its Reactive Change when making saving throws. It may also reserve this ability for when it is targeted by attacks from particularly heavy-hitting players, such as rogues or paladins. However, if the nekomata has a creature grappled, it may be hesitant to change shape as this will release its prey.

### Nekomata Loot
The valuable items looted from nekomata will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a nekomata.

## Vampiric Bakeneko
These blood-sucking monsters are among the <br> most dangerous of kaibyō. Vampiric bakeneko are <br> blood-sucking shapeshifters born from dark rituals. <br> Though they all have cruel and sadistic natures, their motivations can vary, and each vampiric bakeneko possesses its own goals it works towards by any means necessary.

***Matters of Blood.*** The creation of a vampiric nakeneko is shrouded in mystery, and knowledge of the exact rituals involved remains hidden. The final step of this process requires a cat or a familiar in its cat form to drink the blood of a murder victim. Some believe that the cat's owner or the master of the familiar must be the victim. It's also theorized that the process may be more complex, such as the cat reaching a certain age or possessing a particular affinity for the dark arts. Others believe vampiric nekeneko are created when a powerful malevolent entity, such as a fiend or undead creature, makes a pact with the cat on an instinctual level. 

A cat’s transformation into a bakeneko might also be influenced by its personality and circumstances. Some cats that have been mistreated by their masters seek out this transformation to take revenge on their oppressors. Other cats do so purely out of a desire for greater power. There are even tales of cats who drank the blood of their murdered owners to gain these vampiric powers and become unholy avengers, seeking to enact vengeance upon their owner's killers.

***Slinking Through the Night.*** Once the ritual is complete and a cat transforms into a vampiric bakeneko, it appears as a house cat with human-like intelligence, elongated fangs, and a tail that splits into two. It retains its predatory instincts and is a highly skilled killer, combining the strength and agility of a large predatory cat with the supernatural deadliness of a vampire. The vampiric bakeneko can drain the blood from a victim within seconds using its feline bite, leaving no marks behind. 

However, the vampiric bakeneko possess even stranger and more dangerous powers. It can shapeshift into the form of any dead humanoid it has tasted the blood of, and it emanates an aura that causes nearby victims to feel fatigued and eventually fall asleep if they are not strong-willed enough. These abilities allow the vampiric bakeneko to slip into well-fortified castles and fortresses undetected as it shapeshifts to suit its needs and those in its presence slump into unconsciousness. Once victims are unconscious, the vampiric bakeneko can drain the blood from their bodies without waking them, adding yet more possible forms to their deceptive repertoire.




<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***Long-Term Tormentors.*** Regardless of its modus operandi, a vampiric bakeneko always carries out its plans slowly and methodically. Typically, the creature will single out a target and torment it for weeks, if not months. The bakeneko may start by killing someone close to the target and assuming their form to find creative ways to toy with its target. Over time, it will visit the target during their sleep, draining their blood but keeping them alive so they suffer a slow, agonizing death over several days. The vampiric bakeneko is extremely secretive about its identity and will try to fight its foes in human form, only giving up the ruse when it is impossible to maintain or certain death is imminent.

> ##### The Drowsy Condition
> This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
> &#8226; It moves at half speed.<br>
> &#8226; It has disadvantage on attack rolls, Strength checks and saves, and Dexterity checks and saves.<br>
> &#8226; Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
> &#8226; The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>
> &#8226; If it is subjected to an effect that would make it drowsy again, it falls unconscious.<br>
> <br> A creature that is drowsy or unconscious from being drowsy can repeat the saving throw against the effect that made it drowsy whenever it takes damage or another creature uses an action to slap or shake it. If it takes damage, this save is made with advantage. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that made it drowsy.

>
> ***Aura of Lethargy.*** Each other creature of the bakeneko’s choice that starts its turn within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or become drowsy. 
>
> ***Keen Sight.*** The bakeneko has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ***Pounce.*** If the bakeneko jumps at least 10 feet straight towards a creature and then hits it with a claw or halberd attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The bakeneko makes two attacks: two with its halberd if it’s in humanoid form or one with its bite and one with its claws if it’s in its true form. If bakeneko hits with its claw and bite attacks against the same target while in its true form, the target is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the bakeneko can’t attack another target. The grapple ends if the bakeneko changes shape.
>
> ***Bite. (True Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is prone, it deals additional 13 (3d8) necrotic damage. The target's hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the bakeneko regains hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The bakeneko can choose for the damage to not reduce the target’s hit point maximum below 1. <br>Damage dealt by this attack does not wake sleeping creatures.
>
> ***Claw. (True Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage. Damage dealt by this attack does not wake sleeping creatures.
>
> ***Pinning Halberd (Humanoid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d10 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is prone, it deals  14 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage instead.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Change Shape.*** The bakeneko magically polymorphs into a Small or Medium dead humanoid which it has drunk the blood of or back into its true form. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in each form. If the bakeneko has less than half its maximum hit points, it reverts to its true form.
>
>  ### Reaction
>
> ***Uncanny Dodge.*** The bakeneko halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The bakeneko must be able to see the attacker

### Vampiric Bakeneko Tactics
Vampiric bakeneko are masters of patience, often focusing on tormenting a specific target. They usually try to negotiate or use their sleep-inducing abilities to escape dangerous situations and will only engage in combat under two circumstances:

* It believes its intended target will escape to a place where it can no longer be tormented unless vampiric bakeneko attacks now.
* Its true identity is discovered by someone it believes it can kill to keep its secret from getting out.

The vampiric bakeneko has a couple of abilities with some extra tactical considerations to keep in mind:

***Change Shape.*** Vampiric bakeneko jealously guard their true identities and will go to great lengths to keep this secret, even in combat. They will not transform into their true form unless they are reduced below half their health.

***Wave of Lethargy*** Vampiric bakeneko will attempt to use this ability to avoid a fight whenever possible. If it is forced to fight, it will prioritize killing any targets resisting the aura while ignoring targets that need constant help from other party members to stay awake.

### Vampiric Bakeneko Loot
The valuable items looted from vampiric bakeneko will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a vampiric bakeneko.
