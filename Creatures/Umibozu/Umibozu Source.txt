> ___
>
> ***Freedom of Movement.*** The umibōzu ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.
>
> ***Sea Link.*** The umibōzu takes 20 psychic damage when it starts its turn outside a body of salt water.
>
> ***Siege Monster.*** The umibōzu deals double damage to objects and structures.
>
> ***Storm Aura.*** The umibōzu emanates a stormy magical aura that extends 300 feet from it in every direction, but not through total cover. All unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller are extinguished. The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the projectile they fire moves more than 15 feet through the aura. The aura hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by a strong wind. The area of the aura is difficult terrain for creatures, and any creature other than the umibōzu that ends its turn swimming or flying in this area must succeed on a 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The umibōzu can cause this storm to become inactive at any time (no action required.)
>
> ***Strange Demise.*** If the umibōzu dies, its body disintegrates into 
black ink, leaving behind only equipment the umibōzu was 
wearing or carrying. 
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 62 (10d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Drowning Grasp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target in the same body of water as the umibōzu. *Hit:* 43 (8d8 + 7) force damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 20) and pulled 30 feet toward the umibōzu. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, blinded, and unable to breathe or speak. The umibōzu has two hands, each of which can grapple only one target. At the start of each of the umibōzu's turns, each target grappled by it takes 43 (8d8 + 7) force damage.
> 
> ***Scoop.*** The umibōzu uses its Drowning Implement to scoop up 30 gallons of water and fling it at a point within 100 feet of it. Creatures and objects within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the point. If a creature fails the save by 10 or more, it is pushed 20 feet away instead. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames within 30 feet of the chosen point.
>
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Drowning Implement.*** The umibōzu touches a small non-magical container that it has been given by another creature, causing it to become the umibōzu's Drowning Implement. The Drowning Implement is a magical item that acts as a bag of holding, except it can only contain liquids, and all other items placed within it are expelled into its nearest unoccupied space. The umibōzu can only have one Drowning Implement at a time, and if it uses this action while it already has a Drowning Implement, the previous container loses its magic, and its contents spill out. The Drowning Implement has 70 hit points and AC 16.

>
> **Sea Terror.**  The umibōzus forces a creature that it can see within 100 feet of it to make DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails the saving throw, it is frightened of the Umibōzu until the end of the creature's next turn. If the creature is submerged in water while frightened this way, it immediately takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage, and the condition ends.
