### The Bale Wolf Curse
**Dark Transformation.** A creature afflicted with the Bale Wolf Curse is immediately subjected to a dark transformation into a bale wolf. The creature adopts the statistics of a **bale wolf**, with the following exceptions: it retains its original hit points, hit dice, and Constitution score. The creature's alignment and personality remain unchanged. 

Any equipment the creature was using or wearing drops to the ground at its current location, and for the duration of the transformation, the creature cannot interact with or benefit from its dropped equipment. Additionally, it cannot speak, cast spells, or perform any action requiring hands or speech.

**Dark Instincts.** At the start of each of its turns, the creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its psyche is overcome by the darkness within until the start of its next turn. During this time, it suffers from the following effects:

* It perceives all non-Balewolf creatures as enemies and all Balewolfs as allies until the start of its next turn.

* If there is a non-Balewolf creature within its reach, it must use the Attack action against the nearest one.

* If there are no creatures within its reach, it uses the Dash action to approach the nearest non-Balewolf creature it is aware of.

**Cured or Permanent Transformation.** Should the creature succeed on this saving throw three times, the curse is lifted, and it reverts back to its original form. However, if the creature fails the save three times, the transformation becomes permanent. The creature then adopts the maximum hit points and Constitution score of a Balewolf, becomes an NPC under the DM's control, and can regain hit points as the Balewolf would (NOTE: What is this regain hit points part about?).

Casting *dispel evil and good* or *remove curse* within the first hour of the transformation can reverse the curse. After this initial hour, only *dispel evil and good* or *remove curse*  spells cast at 9th level, the *wish* spell, or divine intervention can restore the creature to its original form.

### Bale Wolves Loot
The valuable items looted from cold ones will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a bale wolf. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Bale Wolf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
