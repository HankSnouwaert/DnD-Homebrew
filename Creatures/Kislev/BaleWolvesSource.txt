## Bale Wolves

Deep within the ancient groves and <br> the silent, enveloping darkness of primeval <br> woodlands, lurk creatures whose very presence <br> chills the blood of seasoned warriors and sows <br> dread in the heart of travelers. These are the bale <br> wolves, monstrous predators that are the stuff of legends.

***Physical Appearance.*** Their haunting visage is a grotesque fusion of wolf and the undead. A skull-like face, stark white and cruelly mocking in its semblance to death, gazes out with eyes that burn with a hunger that's more than just physical. These beasts, larger than any natural wolf, possess claws so strong and sharp that they can easily pin their prey, leaving them helpless before delivering the fatal bite. Their huge fangs, reminiscent of ancient drakes or behemoths, are not just for display. When their jaws close in on vulnerable prey, these fangs eviscerate their victim, often killing them instantly.

***Hunting Tactics.*** A bale wolf is not one to announce its presence prematurely. It stalks, often in a pack. With patient and deliberate intent, it traverses the dark woods, moving like a shadow against the midnight canvas. Any creature wandering carelessly in their territory is at risk of becoming prey to a sneak attack. Before one even senses danger, a pack of bale wolves might be right upon them, poised to strike.

&emsp;***Mysterious Origins.*** Where these abominations came from is a question that has baffled scholars and hunters alike. The most widely accepted theory is that they are the result of the mutating energies of chaos, an otherworldly and malevolent force that touches the very essence of a creature, reshaping it into something far more sinister.

***The Dark Bindings.*** There are those with knowledge, dark and forbidden, who have learned to bind these creatures to their will. Among them, the crones of the northern forests are particularly notorious. With incantations whispered in the dead of night and sacrifices made under the crescent moon, they can summon bale wolves, bending their savage wills to serve as monstrous soldiers.

***The Dark Bloods.*** If the bale wolves werenâ€™t terrifying enough, there exists a cursed variant known as the dark bloods. The bites of these monsters hold a danger beyond the physical. Any victim bitten by a dark blood faces a fate potentially worse than death. They are infected with a curse which transforms them into a bale wolf and threatens their free will. The transformation is as much psychological as it is physical, as the newly transformed wrestle with dark instincts threatening to overtake their very identity. Those who manage to resist, to hold onto that last shred of their self, can eventually repel the curse, returning to their original form. But many are not so fortunate. Those who succumb are lost forever, their old identities consumed, leaving behind only the ravenous creature of the night.

### The Bale Wolf Curse
&emsp;**Dark Transformation.** A creature afflicted with the Bale Wolf Curse is immediately subjected to a dark transformation into a bale wolf. The creature adopts the statistics of a bale wolf, with the following exceptions: it retains its original hit points, hit dice, and Constitution score. The creature's alignment and personality remain unchanged. 

\columnbreak

Any equipment the creature was using or wearing drops to the ground at its current location, and for the duration of the transformation, the creature cannot interact with or benefit from its dropped equipment. Additionally, it cannot speak, cast spells, or perform any action requiring hands or speech.

**Dark Instincts.** At the start of each of its turns, the creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, its psyche is overcome by the darkness within until the start of its next turn. During this time, it suffers from the following effects:

* It perceives all non-Balewolf creatures as enemies and all Balewolfs as allies until the start of its next turn.

* If there is a non-Balewolf creature within its reach, it must use the Attack action against the nearest one.

* If there are no creatures within its reach, it uses the Dash action to approach the nearest non-Balewolf creature it is aware of.



**Ending the Curse.** Should the creature succeed on this saving throw three times, the curse is lifted, and it reverts back to its original form. However, if the creature fails the save three times, the transformation becomes permanent. The creature then adopts the maximum hit points and Constitution score of a Balewolf, becomes an NPC under the DM's control, and can regain hit points as the Balewolf would (NOTE: What is this regain hit points part about?).



Casting *dispel evil and good* or *remove curse* within the first hour of the transformation can reverse the curse. After this initial hour, only *dispel evil and good* or *remove curse*  spells cast at 9th level, the *wish* spell, or divine intervention can restore the creature to its original form.

### Bale Wolf Tactics

&emsp;**How to Intiate Combat.**
These are ambush-oriented creatures, using darkness and woodland cover to make their sneak attacks. They will patiently stalk prey until the see the opportunity to attack from stealth and surprise their victims.

**When to Retreat.**
Once bale wolves initiate their attack, they will only retreat when being commanded by another more powerful creature. Otherwise, they will fight to the death and relentlessly pursue fleeing players.


**Getting Advantage on Vicious Bite.**
In combat, the bale wolf's tactics revolve around it getting advantage on its bite attack to increase the odds of getting a crit with it. There are a few ways they can go about securing advantage:

* Utilizing their Pack Tactics
* Attacking from a hidden position
* Focusing their bites on a single target until they can knock it prone and pin it with their claws

**Working As a Pack.**
When bale wolves are operating as a pack, they instinctively hunt down the physically weakest player, relentlessly attacking until one of the bale wolves has the player prone and pinned. They will then move from player to player, repeating this process until they are all pinned, or there are only two bale wolves left. The remaining two bale wolves will then focus on the player closest to death. 

#### Dark Bloods
The key difference between these bale wolves and their "ordinary" kin is the curse they can inflict with their bite. There are some key strategies to keep in mind when cursing players:

* Prioratize attacking non-cursed players over cursed players to spread the curse to as many players as possible. Only focus on cursed players when they are doing something very disruptive, like pinning a bale wolf with their claws or scoring a critical hit on it.

* Cursed players who've lost control for a round and are attacking their allies can be used to trigger the bale wolf's Pack Tactics ability since they are momentarily on the same side.

### Bale Wolves Loot
The valuable items looted from cold ones will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a bale wolf. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Bale Wolf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
