## The Crone Grandmother

Whispered tales of darkness and caution, shared by the crackling fire or told to frightful children in their beds, often speak of The Crone Grandmother. She is a figure looming large in the folklore of countless civilizations. Those who have truly crossed her path know her not merely as a tale, but as a force of nature, one that they'd rather forget.

Her visage is as haunting as the stories suggest. Many say she resembles a decrepit old woman, bent but unbroken by her countless years. Her skin is sallow, riddled with the markings of the arcane. Eyes as deep as the darkest forest pools seem to hold eons of knowledge and wrath, while long, bony fingers end in sharpened claws. The Grandmother's gnarled form is adorned with trinkets and fetishes of old, her raiment crafted from the very creatures of the woods she calls home. 

It is said she emerged from the deepest corners of the ancient woodlands. As the guardian of her homeland, her power is intimately tied to it. Any who would dare harm her cherished woods would find themselves cursed by her magic. This isn't just any curse; it's a blight that seeps into one's very essence, causing their talents and strengths to wane, followed by an inexorable ebbing of life itself.

Even as she withers her foes away, her own vigor is restored as she draws vitality from the very soil she protects.

Yet, for all her terrifying might, there exists an even darker form that she can assume. When pushed beyond her limits, she allows herself to be consumed by the primeval spirit known as the ancient widow. This spirit transforms her into a hulking monstrosity, towering over her foes. In this form, her claws brim with ancient curses, and her iron teeth, now grotesquely pronounced, can grind to emit a shrill, maddening noise that lays her enemies low.

But for all her terrifying reputation, one thing is clear. The Crone Grandmother is a guardian first and foremost, a protector of her sacred homeland. To those who would harm it, she is a nightmare incarnate. Yet, to those who show respect and tread lightly, she remains a distant myth, a story to be shared in hushed tones, a warning to heed. Respect the wilds, and the wilds will respect you. But cross the Crone Grandmother, and you may just find the tales to be terrifyingly real.

>
> ***Draw from the Earth.*** When the crone casts a spell of 1st level or higher, she may cause a 10-foot square of ground centered on herself to become bewitched for one minute. She can have up to three different areas bewitched at one time. At the start of the crone's turn, she or a creature she can see within 30 feet of her regains 10 hit points for each bewitched area within 60 feet of her that does not have a hostile creature occupying it. A *dispel magic* spell or similar magic will end the bewitchment on any given area.
>
> ***Forest Camouflage.*** The crone has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forest terrain.
>
> ***Malediction of Ruin (1/Day).*** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the crone names up to six creatures, cursing each of them for one minute or until the crone dies. When a creature cursed this way starts its turn within 120 feet of the crone, it must make a DC 18 saving throw; on failure, one of its ability scores is reduced by 1d4 until the curse ends. The target dies if this reduces its score to 0. The saving throw type and the ability score that is reduced is the creature's highest ability score other than Constitution. If two or more ability scores are tied for the highest value, the crone chooses one. A *remove curse* spell cannot remove the curse from a creature unless cast at a 6th level or higher; if it is cast at a lower level, it instead allows the creature to automatically succeed on its next saving throw against the curse.
>
> ***Spirits' Wrath.*** When the crone hits with a spell attack, she adds her Wisdom modifier to the damage dealt on a hit (5), and if the target is a creature, she can push it up to 10 feet away from her in a straight line.
>
> ***Survivor (30 HP, 1/Day).*** When the crone's hit points drop to half or less, for the next minute, she gains advantage on all saving throws and also gains 25 temporary hit points at the start of each of her turns.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The crone can make two Quarterstaff attacks or cast two cantrips.
>
> ***Quarterstaff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, or 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The crone casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Wisdom as her spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks):
>
> **At will:** druidcraft, *eldritch blast (three attacks)*, guidance
>
> **2/Day:** *amber spear** (4th level), *augury*, *crippling pain** (4th level), *summon flock** (5th level), *withering resolve**
>
> **1/Day:** *bestial spirit**, *impending doom**, *scrying*, *mindrazors**
>
> ### Legendary Actions
>
> The crone can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The crone regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.
> 
> **Blast.** The crone casts *eldritch blast*, making only one attack.
>
> **Check.** The crone makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Teleport.** The crone teleports herself to any other spot within 15 feet. She arrives at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place she can see, one she can visualize, or one she can describe by stating distance and direction. If she would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, the ability fails to teleport her.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If the crone is suffering from an effect that allows her to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of her next turn, she may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. She can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Spell Casting (Costs 3 Actions).** The crone casts a spell.

### Form of the Ancient Widow
When the Crone Grandmother would drop to 0 hit points or die, instead, her body begins twisting, twitching, and contorting as she becomes possessed by the Ancient Widow. The Crone Grandmother instantly changes into her Ancient Widow form in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of where her first form disappeared. Her initiative count doesn't change. 

When she has access to this ability, both her forms combined are treated as a CR 18 creature.

> **Grinding Teeth. (Costs 2 Actions)** The widow grinds her metal teeth together, making an ear-splitting sound. Each other creature within 120 feet of the widow must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (3d6) thunder damage and falls prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't fall prone.

### Crones' Huts
Birthed from the mystical mastery of The Crone Grandmother, the crone's huts stand as legendary embodiments of the woodland's might and the mystical power of the crones. Towering on colossal chicken legs, these huts are more than mere dwellings; they're animated entities with a semblance of life. Adorned with elements of the forest, their windows gleam eerily like living eyes, and their structure can produce haunting melodies.

\columnbreak

<br>

These huts serve as mobile sanctuaries, effortlessly relocating to keep their crone inhabitants safe. Their natural camouflage lets them meld with the forest surroundings, becoming nearly invisible. If threatened, they can ruthlessly stomp and punt would-be intruders. The creation of such a hut requires immense power and elaborate rituals, binding the crone's essence to the dwelling. Once bound, the hut obeys the crone's every command and desire, becoming an extension of her will. Should the crone perish, the hut may go on a vengeful rampage or simply become dormant as its will slowly fades away.

>
> ***Bound.*** The hut is magically bound to a creature. As long as the hut and the creature are on the same plane of existence, the creature can telepathically call the hut to it, and the hut knows the distance and direction of the creature. If a creature inside the hut casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to have the hut maintain concentration on the spell in its stead. The hut doesn't make concentration saving throws unless the damage that would force the save is from a critical hit.
>
> ***Extradimensional Walls.*** Creatures can't teleport into the hut unless it allows them to. Additionally, creatures with incorporeal movement or similar abilities can't move through its walls. The walls also extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The hut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
>
> ***Interior.*** A Large or smaller creature can spend all its movement to enter inside the hut or leave it, or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the hut is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter. If the hut succeeds, the creature can't enter. Any movement it used to try to enter is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. 
> 
> The interior is a 15-foot-square space. While a creature is inside the hut, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the hut. Any attack that hits the hut from the inside is a critical hit.
>
> ***Sure-Footed.*** The hut has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone or move it against its will.
>
> ***Warded Home.*** The hut and creatures inside it have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects originating from outside the hut. Additionally, creatures in the hut are shielded against divination magic, as though protected by a *nondetection* spell.
>
> ***Woodland Stalker.*** The hut has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage. Additionally, the hut can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The hut makes two *Pinning Claw* attacks and uses *Expel*. It can replace one of its *Pinning Claw* with a *Punt* attack as long it is not grappling two or more creatures.
>
> ***Pinning Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not inside the hut. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled. The hut has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Punt.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not inside the hut or grappled by it. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away. It has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is prone. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 11), it is pushed 40 feet away instead.
>
> ***Expel.*** The hut spins and attempts to force a number of creatures of its choice inside it to leave. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be thrown anywhere between 20 to 40 feet away (the hut's choice). If the thrown target would hit another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be hit, taking 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage and becoming prone. On a successful save, the creature dodges and takes no damage.

### The Crone Grandmother Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring the wisened grandmother in your games:

##### Crone Grandmother Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Blighted Land:** Crops are failing and livestock are dying in the nearby lands. The local leaders suspect that it is the work of The Crone Grandmother, cursing the lands for some unknown transgression. They seek the party's aid to negotiate with her or, if that fails, to put an end to her curse.|
|  2  | **Cursed Bloodline:** A local noble seeks the party's help after being cursed by The Crone Grandmother, causing their lineage to slowly transform into wild beasts. To break the curse, they must delve into the heart of the haunted woods, confront the crone, and unravel her reasons for enmity against the noble family.|
|  3  |**The Walking Hut:** Reports abound of a massive hut on chicken legs terrorizing remote settlements. Each attack corresponds with an ancient stone being stolen from the village. The adventurers must track down the hut, confront its crone master, and uncover her plan involving these ancient stones. |
|  4  | **The Crones' Cue:** A rogue faction of woodland crones, disapproving of the Grandmother’s methods, threatens to upend the balance of the forests. Reluctantly, she and the adventurers must come together to restore equilibrium. |

### The Crone Grandmother Tactics

**Malediction of Ruin:** This curse ensures the crone's adversaries will slowly wither away, losing their effectiveness over time before finally perishing. Assuming she is able to utilize it effectively, she will fight defensively and use attrition to wear her enemies down.

**Draw from the Earth:** The crone aims to disseminate the bewitched ground across the battlefield, positioning them at intervals within 60 feet of each other. Her focus is on keeping adversaries away from these grounds, thus granting her the stamina to outlast her foes.

#### Concentration Spells & Their Priority
**Impending Doom:** This spell accelerates the effects of Malediction of Ruin and should target characters with poor Charisma saves.

**Bestial Spirit:** The summoned spirit should be positioned atop foes standing on the bewitched ground, compelling them to relocate or suffer its damage.

**Withering Resolve:** This spell accelerates the effects of Malediction of Ruinand should target characters with poor Wisdom saves. If the crone can maintain concentration on two spells—by using a crone's sled or crone's hut—she will use this spell twice on the same target.

**Summon Flock:** The attacks from this spell gain potency from the crone's Spirit's Wrath trait, and she uses them to drive enemies off her bewitched terrain.

\columnbreak

**Mindrazors:** This spell excels when the crone has weapon-wielding allies. If so, it takes precedence; otherwise, it's of limited value.



#### Non-Concentration Spells & Their Casting Priority

**Amber Spear:** This spell is best used when it can affect three or more targets (or two targets with low Dexterity saves).

**Eldritch Blast:** Leveraging her Spirit's Wrath trait, the crone uses this spell to push foes away from her bewitched ground.

**Crippling Pain:** This spell is ideally cast upon agile players, such as monks or rogues.

#### Ancient Widow Form
The crone retains the same combat priorities as her standard form. Her overarching objective remains to prolong battles, allowing her Malediction of Ruin to erode her adversaries.

**Cursed Metal Bite:** This attack is reserved for the most vulnerable foes. The crone uses it on the player whose ability score has suffered the greatest reduction.

**Legendary Claw Attacks:** Her legendary actions are primarily employed to unleash claw strikes on the most wounded enemy.

**Countering Melee Denial:** If opponents are staying out of her melee range, the crone retaliates with her Bewitched Bolt attacks. Furthermore, she utilizes her legendary actions to employ the devastating Grinding Teeth ability to damage and knock foes prone, giving her a chance to close in on them.



### Crone's Hut Tactics
The crone's hut is created by and loyal to the crones and dutifully carries out any command they give it. Its primary function is safeguarding a crone's magical items or the crone herself. When occupied by a crone, the hut transforms into a mobile fortress, offering protection and mobility.
Despite its formidable presence, the hut tends to avoid direct confrontations with creatures that have high Strength and Athletics scores. The risk lies in these foes being able to break inside the hut and either harm the crone within or inflict damage on the hut from the inside out. Instead, the hut prioritizes targeting those with less Strength.

#### Combat Tactics
The hut prioritizes attacking two creatures within 30 feet of each other. This tactic allows it to utilize its pinning claw attacks without needing to move and allows it to grapple two adversaries simultaneously.

If the hut begins its turn with a melee-focused enemy grappled, it will use an attack to punt the enemy away to maintain distance.

#### Special Expel Combos

**Punt and Expel Combo:** If the hut has an enemy grappled, it can punt that creature and then swiftly expel another creature from inside itself 
toward the enemy it just punted.

**Expel, Claw, Punt Combo:** If the hut doesn't have any adversaries grappled, it can approach an expelled creature, lash out with a claw attack, and subsequently punt the creature away.

### Crone Grandmother Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Crone Grandmother comes in the form of items she wears <Br> or carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

If the players are looting her hut for materials that were part of its construction, they could use Intelligence checks with the appropriate tools such as Carpenter's Tools or Woodcarver's Tools.

#### Crone Grandmother Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
