> ***Draw from the Earth.*** When the crone casts a spell of 1st level or higher, she may cause a 10-foot square of ground centered on herself to become bewitched for one minute. She can have up to three different areas bewitched at one time. At the start of the crone's turn, she or a creature she can see within 30 feet of her regains 10 hit points for each bewitched area within 60 feet of her that does not have a hostile creature occupying it. A *dispel magic* spell or similar magic will end the bewitchment on any given area.
>
> ***Forest Camouflage.*** The crone has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forest terrain.
>
> ***Malediction of Ruin (1/Day).*** On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the crone names up to six creatures, cursing each of them for one minute or until the crone dies. When a creature cursed this way starts its turn within 120 feet of the crone, it must make a DC 18 saving throw; on failure, one of its ability scores is reduced by 1d4 until the curse ends. The target dies if this reduces its score to 0. The saving throw type and the ability score that is reduced is the creature's highest ability score other than Constitution. If two or more ability scores are tied for the highest value, the crone chooses one. A *remove curse* spell cannot remove the curse from a creature unless cast at a 6th level or higher; if it is cast at a lower level, it instead allows the creature to automatically succeed on its next saving throw against the curse.
>
> ***Spirits' Wrath.*** When the crone hits with a spell attack, she adds her Wisdom modifier to the damage dealt on a hit (5), and if the target is a creature, she can push it up to 10 feet away from her in a straight line.
>
> ***Survivor (30 HP, 1/Day).*** When the crone's hit points drop to half or less, for the next minute, she gains advantage on all saving throws and also gains 25 temporary hit points at the start of each of her turns.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The crone can make two Quarterstaff attacks or cast two cantrips.
>
> ***Quarterstaff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, or 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage if wielded with two hands.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The crone casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Wisdom as her spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks):
>
> **At will:** druidcraft, *eldritch blast (three attacks)*, guidance
>
> **2/Day:** *amber spear** (4th level), *augury*, *crippling pain** (4th level), *summon flock** (5th level), *withering resolve**
>
> **1/Day:** *bestial spirit**, *impending doom**, *scrying*, *mindrazors**
>
> ### Legendary Actions
>
> The crone can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The crone regains spent legendary actions at the start of her turn.
> 
> **Blast.** The crone casts *eldritch blast*, making only one attack.
>
> **Check.** The crone makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Teleport.** The crone teleports herself to any other spot within 15 feet. She arrives at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place she can see, one she can visualize, or one she can describe by stating distance and direction. If she would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a creature, the ability fails to teleport her.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If the crone is suffering from an effect that allows her to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of her next turn, she may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. She can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Spell Casting (Costs 3 Actions).** The crone casts a spell.

> ___
>
> **Wood Stalker.** The hut has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage. Additionally, the hut can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them.
>
> **Bound.** The hut is magically bound to a creature. As long as the hut and the creature are on the same plane of existence, the creature can telepathically call the hut to it, and the hut knows the distance and direction to the creature. If a creature inside the hut casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to have the hut maintain concentration on the spell in its stead. The hut doesn't make concentration saving throws unless the damage is from a critical hit.
>
> **Interior.** A Large or smaller creature can spend all its movement to enter inside the hut or leave it, or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the hut is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter. If the hut succeeds, the creature can't enter. Any movement it used to try to enter is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. The interior is a 15-foot-square space. While a creature is inside the hut, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the hut. Any attack that hits the hut from the inside is a critical hit.
>
> **Warded Home.** The hut and creatures inside it have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects originating from outside the hut. Additionally, creatures in the hut are shielded against divination magic, as though protected by a *nondetection* spell.
>
> **Extradimensional Walls.** Creatures can't teleport into the hut unless it allows them to. Additionally, creatures with Incorporeal Movement or similar abilities can't move through its walls. The walls also extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The hut is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
>
> ***Sure-Footed.*** The hut has advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws made against effects that would knock it prone or move it against its will.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The hut makes two *Pinning Claw* attacks and *Expel*. It can replace one of its *Pinning Claw* with a *Punt* attack as long it is not grappling two or more creatures.
>
> ***Pinning Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not inside the hut. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled. The hut has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Punt.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not inside the hut or grappled by it. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The target must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away. It has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is prone. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 11), it is pushed 40 feet away instead.
>
> ***Expel.*** The hut spins and attempts to force a number of creatures of its choice inside it to leave. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be thrown 20 to 40 feet away. If the thrown target would hit another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be hit, taking 24 (3d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage and knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature dodges and takes no damage.
