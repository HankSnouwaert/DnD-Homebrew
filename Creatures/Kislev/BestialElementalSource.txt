>
> ***Crashing Charge.*** If the elemental moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a creature and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 11 (2d10) damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The creature makes the saving throw with disadvantage if the attack was made using its Bestial Take Down bonus action.
>
> ***One with the Wild.*** The elemental has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena and can do so when only lightly obscured. Additionally, the elemental can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them, and can move through trees as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 10 force damage if it ends its turn inside a tree.
>
> ***Primal Senses.*** The elemental has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on the checks in areas that are lightly obscured.
>
> ***Talons of the Forest.*** When the elemental makes an attack, it ignores half and three-quarters cover provided by foliage.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The elemental makes two attacks.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage.
>
> ***Savage Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) for each time this turn the target has already been hit with its Talon attack this turn.
>
> ***Pulverizing Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a prone creature, it cannot stand up until the end of the elemental's next turn unless it uses its action to succeed on a DC 20 Constitution check.
>
> ***Amber Breath (1/day).*** The elemental exhales amber light in a 60-foot line that is 15 feet wide. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (5d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The creatures gain no benefit from cover given by foliage for this saving throw.
>
> ***Flock of Doom.*** The elemental fills a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 100 feet of it with shadowy crows. The elemental can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by the crows. The sphere spreads around corners, and it lasts until the elemental uses the ability again, is more than 100 feet away from the area, or loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell). The sphere's area is difficult terrain, and creatures in it have disadvantage on ranged attack rolls. At the end of each of the elemental's turns, each creature in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 15 (6d4) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature has disadvantage on the saving throw if it is surprised. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 8), it is blinded until the end of the elemental's next turn. On each of the elemental's turns, the elemental may move the crows 50 feet in any direction (no action required). Using this ability does not reveal the elemental if it is hidden from a creature.
> 
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Howl of the Great Beast (1/day).*** The elemental lets out a primeval howl. The elemental can designate any number of creatures it is aware of to be unaffected by it. Each affected creature within 120 feet of it that can hear it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes frightened of the elemental. The creature can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the elemental by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. It can then make a Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on it on a success. (NOTE: When does it make the saving throws?)
>
> ***Bestial Take Down.*** The elemental makes one weapon attack. After the attack, the elemental falls prone. If it has 90 or fewer hit points, the attack is made with advantage.

### Bestial Elemental Tactics
Bestial elementals are ambush predators and experts at stealthily navigating woodland environments to attack from optimal hidden positions. Knocking enemies prone will be their primary tactic throughout the fight as it allows them to stack successive talon attacks on a single target more easily. The elemental never flees from combat unless directed to by someone controlling it.

#### Special Abilities

&emsp;**Flock of Doom.** The elemental generally uses this ability at the start of the fight, ideally before it's even spotted by the players. The elemental will stay hidden for as long as possible while withering away the players with the flock. The elemental will only charge into combat if it manages to blind a vulnerable player it can reach, or one of the players spot it. While the flock is active during combat, the elemental will position it to hinder ranged attackers. 

**Amber Breath.** This ability is deployed when the elemental can hit three or more targets simultaneously. 

#### Attack Sequence

The elemental's primary targets are those blinded by its flock and any vulnerable prey it can reach. The target's distance and whether it's prone affects how the elemental will attack.<br><br>

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Available.** 
* The elemental uses Howl of the Great Beast.
* It then closes the distance and makes a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If finishes with a stomp attack.

**Targets Within 60ft. & Howl of The Great Beast is Not Available.** 
* The elemental uses its Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a Gore attack, repositioning itself to get the bonus from Crashing Charge if necessary so it can attempt to knock its target prone. 
* If it manages to knock the target prone, it will follow up with two stomp attacks; otherwise, it will make two talon attacks.

**Targets Beyond 60ft.**
* The elemental dashes to its target.
* The elemental uses the Bestial Take Down bonus action to make a gore attack.
* The elemental stands back up.
Note, if the elemental lacks the remaining movement to stand back up, it will be unlikely to use Bestial Takedown and leave itself vulnerable.

**Targets Already Prone.**
* The elemental attacks with two talon attacks.
* If both attacks hit, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make another talon attack.
* If any of the attacks miss, it will follow up with a Bestial Takedown bonus action to make a stomp attack.

### Bale Wolf Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these twisted beasts in your games:

##### Bale Wolf Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Bale Wolf Bounty:** The local lord has issued a challenge: rid the northern forests of the bale wolves, which have been attacking travelers and trade caravans. The reward is substantial, but rumors suggest that a previous group of hunters never returned.|
|  2  | **The Crone's Pack:** A child has gone missing in the woods, and the only clue left behind is a single bale wolf's paw print. The adventurers must venture deep into the forest to rescue the child, only to discover an old crone manipulating the bale wolves for her own dark purposes.|
|  3  |**The Bale Wolf's Curse:** A village bordering a dark woodland is cursed; every full moon, one villager turns into a bale wolf. The adventurers must find the source of the curse and stop it before the entire village succumbs. |
|  4  | **The Druid's Plea:** An old druid seeks the party's assistance. The balance of the forest is threatened by the increasing numbers of bale wolves. They're an unnatural presence that must be removed. But as the party investigates, they find that the druid himself might have connections to the origin of these beasts. |
|  5  | **The Old Catacombs:** A city built near ancient woods is plagued by bale wolf attacks. However, these wolves aren't coming from the forest; theyâ€™re emerging from old catacombs beneath the city. What old secrets does the city hide that attracts these creatures?  |
|  6  | **Dark Blood Festival:** During a grand festival, a series of attacks by dark bloods plunges the celebrations into chaos. The adventurers must protect the attendees, uncover the culprits behind the coordinated assault, and find a way to prevent the spread of the curse among the wounded.|

### Bestial Elemental Loot
Because these creatures are elementals, they don't have flesh and blood like mundane other creatures, and most of their body disintegrates when they die. Amidst the smokey ashes they leave behind, players may be able to salvage some bone or hide that remained corporeal or even some of their magical essence before it evaporates. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Bestial Elemental Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Bestial Elemental Loot Table


| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-10  | 1 500gp Item |
|  11-15 | 1d4(2) 500gp Items | 
|  16-21 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items  |  
|  22-25 |  1d6(3) 1,000gp Items |  
|  25+ |  1d4(2) 2,000gp Items |
