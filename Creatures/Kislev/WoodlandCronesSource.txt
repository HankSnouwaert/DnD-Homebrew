## Woodland Crones
In the depths of the primeval woods, where shadows dance with the ethereal whispers of the past, the woodland crones have carved out their existence. These mysterious women are an enigma, both protectors of the ancient ways and potential agents of darkness.

Woodland crones, with the weight of ages upon them, appear as supernaturally aged and grizzled women. Their long, tangled hair often interweaves with the very elements of the forests they call home. Around their necks, wrists, and waists, they adorn themselves with primeval witch charms, each with its own tale and power.

Deeply connected to the spirit world, these crones serve as wise women, their eyes perceiving the unseen and their voices communing with the spirits. While some offer their guidance to remote rural communities, others opt for solitude, living as hermits amidst the thickets and glades.
Those who live near or even alongside these crones are torn between respect and trepidation. To the rural folks, they are indispensable spiritual leaders and guides in times of uncertainty. However, to more "civilized" individuals, these crones are often seen with suspicion and distrust, their primal ways misunderstood and feared.

For all the good they might offer, the Woodland Crones dance a dangerous line. The spirits they commune with are not always benevolent, and some crones find themselves seduced by darker entities, leading them to pursue more nefarious goals.

Beyond their spellcasting prowess, the crones hold the ability to beseech the spirits to inflict curses upon their enemies. From causing physical frailty to fraying one's mind, their curses are both varied and potent.

When crones come together, forming secretive covens, they are led by the eldest among them. These leaders, bearing the title of "Mother," are reservoirs of ancient knowledge and power, their decisions shaping the actions of their coven. They alone possess the power to channel dark spirits through their body in times of need to become wicked avatars of the vengeful forest known as Ancient Widows.
Covens often form deep, mystical bonds with specific forests. This bond allows them to tap into the very essence of the land, drawing strength from its spirits and sharing the mystic powers that the forest bestows.

With mere whispers, the crones can call upon the creatures of the woods. From simple animals like ravens and wolves to the more monstrous denizens of the deep forest, these beings serve the crones, driven by an unseen bond.
In times of great conflict, the crones take to the battlefield in chariots, atop which sit their magical cauldrons which serve as a focus for their eldritch power. Pulled by mystic woodland harts, these chariots provide not only mobility but also protection, allowing the crones to unleash devastating curses upon their adversaries.

> ***Hexed Cauldron.*** When a creature riding the sled casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to have the sled maintain concentration on the spell in its stead. The sled only loses concentration if it is destroyed, if it starts concentrating on a new spell, or if the spell-casting creature is either dead or moves more than 30 feet from the sled.
>
> ***Trample.*** The chariot and its steeds can move through the space of a prone hostile creature without using additional movement if that creature is Medium-sized or smaller. If the chariot or its steeds end their turn within the creature's space, the creature becomes restrained. While restrained this way, the affected creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 12 Strength check to try to free it. On a success, the restrained creature is moved to an unoccupied space of its choosing within 5 feet of the chariot and is no longer restrained.
>
> ***Winter Thicket Runner.*** The sled and its steeds are unaffected by non-magical, difficult terrain. Additionally, they can traverse through plants and ice without being slowed, grappled, restrained, knocked prone, or taking damage from thorny, spiky, or other hazardous plant features.
>
>
> ### Steed Actions
>
> ***Freezing Charge.*** When a steed moves at least 20 feet in a straight line, it can then make a melee weapon attack against each creature it's facing within 5 feet. On a hit, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) cold damage. If this attack knocks a target prone, ice forms around the target, restraining it for 1 minute. The restrained creature, or another creature within its reach, can use an action to break the ice and end the restrained condition.

### Boons of the Forest

Crones can invoke the power of the ancient forests they protect to call upon powerful boons. One or more crones may be tied to the same forest this way, granting them access to the same boons.

While a crone is within the forest she's tied to, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), she can take a lair action to invoke one of the boons described below. Once a crone uses one of the effects, it can't be used again by any crone in the forest for the next hour. Only one crone can invoke the power of the forest this way each round. Each boon a crone has access to increases her CR by 2.

Each boon gains its power from a specific Large object or creature within the forest. If such an object is destroyed or creature killed, the crones lose the ability to use that boon. A forest controlled by one more crones could have multiple objects or creatures that each provide access to a boon.

Examples of these objects or creatures could include:
* A large totem or stone marker
* An ancient tree
* A powerful beast that lives in the woods
* One of the crones herself

#### Woodland Boons

&emsp;***Bewitching Lure.*** The crone targets any number of creatures she is aware of within 120 feet. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become charmed by the crone until the end of its next turn. While charmed in this way, the creature must use the Dash action to move toward the crone by the safest available route unless it has nowhere to move.

***Chant of Purification.*** The crone selects a point within 120 feet that she can see. For each creature within 60 feet of that point, the crone can end one disease, curse, or one of the following conditions afflicting it: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

***Grasping Forest.*** Foliage reaches out to grasp any creatures of the crone's choosing that she is aware of within 120 feet. Any chosen creature within 5 feet of a plant must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by entangling roots and vines. While restrained, the creature can't teleport or use extradimensional or interplanar means of travel. The restraint can be ended if the creature or another creature that can reach it uses an action to make a DC 15 Strength check to rip away the plants. The entangling plants wither away after 1 minute.

***Jinxed Land.*** The crone, any chariot she is riding, and any number of willing creatures within 15 feet of her are teleported to a spot within 5 feet of a tree within 100 feet. Any creature teleported this way becomes invisible until the start of its next turn.


***Wild Spirit.*** The crone summons a spirit with the stats of a Cave Bear at a point within 60 feet of her. The summoned creature acts as an ally to the crone and her companions. It acts on initiative count 20, taking its turn immediately after the crone. It obeys any verbal commands given by the crone (no action required). If no commands are given, it attacks any hostile creatures within its line of sight. The bear vanishes after one minute.

> ##### Designer's Note: Player Incentives
> If you're running an adventure where the players are exploring woods controlled by multiple crones, having various objects imbued with hexes can provide players with additional objectives to destroy these objects, making their journey through the woods easier. Alternatively, you may have the players assist the crones in their battle against the foreign threat. In this case, the crowns could grant the players permission to use the hexes while they travel through the woods.

### Woodland Crone Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these undying lore keepers in your games:

##### Woodland Crone Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Wandering Children:** Children from a nearby village have started disappearing, with the last seen heading towards the woods. Rumors circulate that a woodland crone has been seen in the vicinity. Is she responsible, or is there a deeper mystery at play?|
|  2  | **The Crone's Cure:** A deadly disease has struck a city, and the only known cure is a potion brewed by a Woodland Crone. The party is tasked with venturing into the forest, locating the crone, and obtaining the remedy.|
|  3  |**The Crone's Curse:** A local lord has been cursed by a crone after he desecrated a sacred grove. The party is hired either to lift the curse or to convince the crone to do so. |
|  4  | **Mother's Conclave:** Every few decades, the crone mothers from different covens gather for a secretive conclave. Rumors suggest they plan to summon a powerful spirit entity. The party can either aid or hinder their ritual. |
|  5  | **Darkness Beckons:** A coven of crones, swayed by dark spirits, is amassing power, threatening both the balance of the forests and the neighboring lands. The party must either join forces with benevolent crones or confront this dark coven head-on.  |
|  6  | **The Crone's Quarral:** The party finds themselves caught in a feud between three crones. The have the option to join forces with one of the crones and gain her blessings, but doing so causes the other two to unite against them.|

### Woodland Crone Tactics

These tactics focus on how crones riding their sleds drawn by 2 harts will fight. The tactics will vary significantly if the crone doesn't have a sled, and it is important the crone has the support of minions in such situations, as a lone crone is highly vulnerable and unlikely to last long in a fight.

#### Crone's Sled
While riding her sled, the crone employs hit-and-run strategies, utilizing her harts to ram into vulnerable targets.

The sled's Hexed Cauldron ability allows it to maintain concentration on a spell for the crone. This enables her to maintain two spells that require concentration at once. Typically, the crone assigns her most powerful spell to her sled as it retains concentration unless destroyed.

#### Ancient Widow Form
Crone mothers transform into Ancient Widows when reduced to half health or less, enhancing their melee combat abilities. Despite this transformation, they do not become full-fledged frontline fighters and shouldn't be recklessly thrown into melee combat.


#### Crones of Shadow
More than any other type of crone, crones of shadow depend on their minions to be effective.

**Shadow Paths.** The crone will only use this ability to leave her sled if the sled becomes immobilized. The minion she swaps places with will be charged with restoring the sled's mobility. Once mobile again, the crone will swap back to reassume her position on the sled.

**Harrowing Coil .** Deploy Harrowing Coil on agile skirmishers such as rogues or monks.


##### Spell-Casting Hierarchy
&emsp;**Pit of Shadows.** Prioritize casting this spell on two or more targets with below-average Dexterity.

**Withering Resolve or Penumbral Pendulum.** Opt for penumbral pendulum if it can hit two or more targets or an immobilized target that will be struck again by the pendulum on the subsequent turn.
Alternatively, cast withering resolve on the target with the lowest Wisdom saving throw. Follow up with a charge using the crone's harts to exploit the attacks now made with advantage.

**Mystifying Miasma.** Cast when two or more targets can be hit, with one of them being under the effects of Harrowing Coil, so the conjured shadows inflict extra damage to the cursed creature.

**Shroud of Dusk or Unseen Lurker.** Use Shroud of Dusk when it can hit two or more targets. Unseen Lurker serves as an escape tool or an alternative attack facilitator for the crone. It's particularly effective when used in the crone's Ancient Widow Form to hide her actions or position.


\columnbreak

#### Crones of Death
Crones adept in this lore of magic typically reserve their more potent spells for later combat stages.

**Life Leech Trait.** Crones start off with their lower-level spells to ramp up the bonus from this trait. They will then leverage their increased power to maximize their most powerful spells.

**Inversus Curse.** This curse should target a creature with low Charisma and Wisdom, who will then become a prime target for the crone's single-target spells.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Aspect of Dread.** This is a potent opening spell forcing multiple targets to make saving throws, thereby fueling the Life Leech trait. Beware that this spell can also affect allies.

**Impending Doom.** This is best used against a target marked with the Inversus curse. The crone can then follow this up with an assault by her harts and sled to take advantage of its poor saving throws.

**Spirit Leech.** Use this spell against creatures maked with the Inversus curse target before the crone's hit points drop to half so the temporary hit points gained don't cancel out any she will get from her Survivor or Ancient Widow trait.

**Crippling Pain.** Cast this on either the Inversus-cursed target or a creature encased in ice by the Freezing Charge ability of the harts.

**Horrifying Laughter.** Cast upon the Inversus-cursed target once the Life Leech trait has enhanced the crone's saving throws by +2.


#### Crones of Beasts
Because many of these crones' spells have a duration of an hour, and they have ways to maintain several of them at once, crones of beasts can be significantly more dangerous if they have time to prepare for a fight. 

**Wild Heart Trait.** This trait, when coupled with the crone riding on a sled, enables her to maintain concentration on three spells simultaneously, with the harts being prime targets for her spells. 

**Craven Scent Curse.** This curse is best targeted at frontline fighters.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Impenetrable Pelt.** The crone casts this defensive spell on herself to bolster her survivability.

**Bestial Spirit.** The summoned spirit should be positioned next to melee fighters possessing low Dexterity or targets slow enough that they can't outrun the Bestial Spirit.

**Wild Surge.** This spell works well with the Wild Heart trait and should target the crone's most formidable minion or herself while she is in Ancient Widow Form and has lost concentration on Impenetrable Pelt.

**Amber Spear.** This spell is particularly effective when it can hit three targets simultaneously (or at least two targets with low Dexterity).

**Summon Flock.** This spell is generally a lower priority among the crone's concentration spells. It's mostly useful when the crone doesn't have access to Impenetrable Pelt or she's scouting for enemies within her forest domain. The spell inflicts minimal damage, and its primary utility lies in disrupting the concentration of opposing spell casters.

### Woodland Crone Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from woodland crones come in the form of items they wear or carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Woodland Crone Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

# Chariots

Chariots are iconic vehicles of war, allowing mighty steeds to pull soldier-filled carriages into battle. The number of steeds able to pull a chariot and the number of riders its carriage can support varies from one vehicle to the next. Some are even designed to be pulled by creatures other than horses. Chariots may charge headlong into enemy forces or ride past foes who are then dispatched by scythed wheels and spear-wielding riders. They are often a status symbol, and many warrior generals lead their armies from them. In some cultures, chariots are used for racing or other gladiatorial sporting events. 

The following rules can help you codify ways to use chariots in your games. They can be applied to chariots of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own chariots. The rules here can be applied to most vehicles pulled by other creatures, such as wagons and carriages. At the end of the document, there are some example chariots you can incorporate into your own games.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.



#### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, chariots are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The chariot may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by steeds.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.

<br>

> ##### Determining Chariot CR
>When building your own chariot, you can determine its CR using most of the creature creation guidelines described in the DMG with the following modifications:
> * Determine its Offensive CR using additional damage per round it grants to its riders and steeds.
> * Determine its Defensive CR using half its HP.
> * Consider other traits it has the same way you would consider creature attributes.
