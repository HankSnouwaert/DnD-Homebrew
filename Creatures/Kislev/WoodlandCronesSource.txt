While cursed, if the creature is within 5 feet of two hostile creatures that are not incapacitated, or within 5 feet of a creature one size larger than it, the cursed creature has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws to maintain concentration.

### Hexes of the Wood

Crones can invoke the power of the ancient woods that they protect to perform powerful hexes. One or more crones may be tied to the same forest this way, granting them access to the same hexes.

While a crone is within the forest she's tied to, on initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), she can take a lair action to invoke one of the hexes described below. Once a crone uses one of the effects, it can't be used again by any crone in the forest for the next hour. Only one crone can invoke the power of the forest this way each round. Each hex a crone has access to increases her CR by 2.

Each hex gains its power from a specific Large object or creature within the forest. If such an object is destroyed or creature killed, the crones lose the ability to use that hex. A forest controlled by one more crones could have multiple objects or creatures that each provide access to a different hex.

Some examples of these objects or creatures could include:
* A large totem or stone marker
* An ancient tree
* A powerful beast that lives in the woods
* One of the crones herself

#### Woodland Hexes

***Chant of Purification.*** The crone selects a point within 120 feet that she can see. For each creature within 60 feet of that point, the crone can end one disease, curse, or one of the following conditions afflicting it: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, paralyzed, or poisoned.

***Jinxed Land.*** The crone, any chariot she is riding, and any number of willing creatures within 15 feet of her are teleported to a spot within 5 feet of a tree within 100 feet. Any creature teleported this way becomes invisible until the start of its next turn.

***Coven Cursemark.*** Foliage reaches out to grasp any creatures of the crone's choosing that she is aware of within 120 feet. Any chosen creature within 5 feet of a plant must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained by entangling roots and vines. While restrained, the creature can't teleport or use extradimensional or interplanar means of travel. The restraint can be ended if the creature or another creature that can reach it uses an action to make a DC 15 Strength check to rip away the plants. The entangling plants wither away after 1 minute.

***Wild Spirit.*** The crone summons a spirit with the stats of a Cave Bear at a point within 60 feet of her. The summoned creature acts as an ally to the crone and her companions. It acts on initiative count 20, taking its turn immediately after the crone. It obeys any verbal commands given by the crone (no action required). If no commands are given, it attacks any hostile creatures within its line of sight. The bear vanishes after one minute.

***Bewitching Lure.*** The crone targets any number of creatures she is aware of within 120 feet. Each chosen creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become charmed by the crone until the end of its next turn. While charmed in this way, the creature must use the Dash action to move toward the crone by the safest available route unless it has nowhere to move.



> ##### Designer's Note: Player Incentives
> If you're running an adventure where the players are exploring woods controlled by multiple crones, having various objects imbued with hexes can provide players with additional objectives to destroy these objects, making their journey through the woods easier. Alternatively, you may have the players assist the crones in their battle against the foreign threat. In this case, the crowns could grant the players permission to use the hexes while they travel through the woods.

### Woodland Crone Tactics

These tactics focus on how crones riding their sleds drawn by 2 harts will fight. The tactics will vary significantly if the crone doesn't have a sled, and it is important the crone has the support of minions in such situations, as a lone crone is highly vulnerable and unlikely to last long in a fight.

#### Crone's Sled
While riding her sled, the crone employs hit-and-run strategies, utilizing her harts to ram into vulnerable targets.

The sled's Hexed Cauldron ability allows it to maintain concentration on a spell for the crone. This enables her to maintain two spells that require concentration at once. Typically, the crone assigns her most powerful spell to her sled as it retains concentration unless destroyed.

#### Ancient Widow Form
Crone mothers transform into Ancient Widows when reduced to half health or less, enhancing their melee combat abilities. Despite this transformation, they do not become full-fledged frontline fighters and shouldn't be recklessly thrown into melee combat.


#### Crones of Shadow
More than any other type of crone, crones of shadow depend on their minions to be effective.

**Shadow Paths.** The crone will only use this ability to leave her sled if the sled becomes immobilized. The minion she swaps places with will be charged with restoring the sled's mobility. Once mobile again, the crone will swap back to reassume her position on the sled.

**Harrowing Coil .** Deploy Harrowing Coil on agile skirmishers such as rogues or monks.


##### Spell-Casting Hierarchy
&emsp;**Pit of Shadows.** Prioritize casting this spell on two or more targets with below-average Dexterity.

**Withering Resolve or Penumbral Pendulum.** Opt for penumbral pendulum if it can hit two or more targets or an immobilized target that will be struck again by the pendulum on the subsequent turn.
Alternatively, cast withering resolve on the target with the lowest Wisdom saving throw. Follow up with a charge using the crone's harts to exploit the attacks now made with advantage.

**Mystifying Miasma.** Cast when two or more targets can be hit, with one of them being under the effects of Harrowing Coil, so the conjured shadows inflict extra damage to the cursed creature.

**Shroud of Dusk or Unseen Lurker.** Use Shroud of Dusk when it can hit two or more targets. Unseen Lurker serves as an escape tool or an alternative attack facilitator for the crone. It's particularly effective when used in the crone's Ancient Widow Form to hide her actions or position.

#### Crones of Death
Crones adept in this lore of magic typically reserve their more potent spells for later combat stages.

**Life Leech Trait.** Crones start off with their lower-level spells to ramp up the bonus from this trait. They will then leverage their increased power to maximize their most powerful spells.

**Inversus Curse.** This curse should target a creature with low Charisma and Wisdom, who will then become a prime target for the crone's single-target spells.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Aspect of Dread.** This is a potent opening spell forcing multiple targets to make saving throws, thereby fueling the Life Leech trait. Beware that this spell can also affect allies.

**Impending Doom.** This is best used against a target marked with the Inversus curse. The crone can then follow this up with an assault by her harts and sled to take advantage of its poor saving throws.

**Spirit Leech.** Use this spell against creatures maked with the Inversus curse target before the crone's hit points drop to half so the temporary hit points gained don't cancel out any she will get from her Survivor or Ancient Widow trait.

**Crippling Pain.** Cast this on either the Inversus-cursed target or a creature encased in ice by the Freezing Charge ability of the harts.

**Horrifying Laughter.** Cast upon the Inversus-cursed target once the Life Leech trait has enhanced the crone's saving throws by +2.


#### Crones of Beasts
Because many of these crones' spells have a duration of an hour, and they have ways to maintain several of them at once, crones of beasts can be significantly more dangerous if they have time to prepare for a fight. 

**Wild Heart Trait.** This trait, when coupled with the crone riding on a sled, enables her to maintain concentration on three spells simultaneously, with the harts being prime targets for her spells. 

**Craven Scent Curse.** This curse is best targeted at frontline fighters.

##### Spell-Casting Strategies
&emsp;**Impenetrable Pelt.** The crone casts this defensive spell on herself to bolster her survivability.

**Bestial Spirit.** The summoned spirit should be positioned next to melee fighters possessing low Dexterity or targets slow enough that they can't outrun the Bestial Spirit.

**Wild Surge.** This spell works well with the Wild Heart trait and should target the crone's most formidable minion or herself while she is in Ancient Widow Form and has lost concentration on Impenetrable Pelt.

**Amber Spear.** This spell is particularly effective when it can hit three targets simultaneously (or at least two targets with low Dexterity).

**Summon Flock.** This spell is generally a lower priority among the crone's concentration spells. It's mostly useful when the crone doesn't have access to Impenetrable Pelt or she's scouting for enemies within her forest domain. The spell inflicts minimal damage, and its primary utility lies in disrupting the concentration of opposing spell casters.
