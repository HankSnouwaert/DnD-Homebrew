### Woodland Crone Apprentice <Br> Lore of Magic Options 
Select one of the following lores or magic to determine a crone apprentice's additional passive trait, curse option, and spell list. <Br>
**New spells listed at the end of the document*

<br>

> #### Crone Apprentice: Lore of Beasts
>
> ##### **Trait:**
> ***Wild Heart.*** Whenever the crone targets only herself or one monstrosity, giant, dragon, or fey with an Intelligence of 8 or less with a spell that requires concentration, she can choose for the spell to no longer require concentration. The spell ends early if the crone is incapacitated or uses this feature to alter another spell. <br><br>
> 
> ##### **Crone's Curse:**
> ***Craven Scent (1/Day).*** (NOTE: What's the name supposed to mean?) The crone places a curse on a creature she can see within 90 feet, causing it to lose its conviction when outnumbered or outsized. While cursed, if the creature is within 5 feet of two hostile creatures that are not incapacitated, or within 5 feet of a creature one size larger than it, the cursed creature has disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws to maintain concentration. The curse ends if the crone dies, curses another creature, or uses an action to end it.
<br><br>
> ##### **Spell List:**
> **At will:** *druidcraft*, *eldritch blast*, *guidance*, *primal savagery*<br>
> **1/Day:** *amber spear**, *augury*, *summon flock** (2nd level), *wild surge**

\pagebreakNum

> #### Crone Apprentice: Lore of Death
>
> ##### **Trait:**
> ***Life Leech.*** Whenever a non-undead, non-construct creature fails a saving throw against or is hit by a spell attack from one of the crone's spells of 1st level or higher, the crone gets a +1 to her spell save DC and spell attack rolls for the next minute. She can only gain this bonus once per casting of a spell, and this bonus can stack up to 3 times (+3). <br><br>
> 
> ##### **Crone's Curse:**
> ***Inversus (1/Day)*** (NOTE: Where did the name come from?) The witch places a curse on a creature she can see within 90 feet, causing it to be overwhelmed by frailty. While cursed, if the creature fails a saving throw by 5 or more, it is stunned until the end of its next turn. The curse ends if the witch dies, curses another creature, or uses an action to end it.
<br><br>
> ##### **Spell List:**
> **At will:** *chill touch*, *druidcraft*, *eldritch blast*, *guidance*,<br>

> 
> ##### **Crone's Curse:**
> ***Harrowing Coil (1/Day).*** The crone places a curse on a creature she can see within 90 feet, causing dark spirits to lurk in the shadows around the cursed creature. Until the curse ends, the creature treats dim light and darkness as difficult terrain. When the creature moves into or within an area of dim light or darkness, it takes 1d8 psychic damage for every 5 feet it travels. The curse ends once the crone dies, curses another creature, or ends it as an action.

>
> ***Hexed Cauldron.*** When a creature riding the sled casts a spell that requires concentration, it can choose to have the sled maintain concentration on the spell in its stead. The sled only loses concentration if it is destroyed, if it starts concentrating on a new spell, or if the spell-casting creature is either dead or moves more than 30 feet from the sled.
>
> ***Trample.*** The chariot and its steeds can move through the space of a prone hostile creature without using additional movement if that creature is Medium-sized or smaller. If the chariot or its steeds end their turn within the creature's space, the creature becomes restrained. While restrained this way, the affected creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 12 Strength check to try to free it. On a success, the restrained creature is moved to an unoccupied space of its choosing within 5 feet of the chariot and is no longer restrained.
>
> ***Winter Thicket Runner.*** The sled and its steeds are unaffected by non-magical, difficult terrain. Additionally, they can traverse through plants and ice without being slowed, grappled, restrained, knocked prone, or taking damage from thorny, spiky, or other hazardous plant features.
>
>
> ### Steed Actions
>
> ***Freezing Charge. When a steed moves at least 20 feet in a straight line, it can then make a melee weapon attack against each creature it's facing within 5 feet. On a hit, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) cold damage. If this attack knocks a target prone, ice forms around the target, restraining it for 1 minute. The restrained creature, or another creature within its reach, can use an action to break the ice and end the restrained condition.
