**Garb of the Forest.** These warriors seamlessly blend into the woodland, donning clothing made from the very essence of the woods they call home.
Their attire is a blend of leather hides and animal pelts, interwoven with bones from prized kills and various other forest remnants, designed not only for camouflage but also as an homage to the spirits of the forest.

&emsp;**Shadowy Enforcers.** The woodland ambushers act as secretive scouts and enforcers operating outside any form of structured or traditional law. Employed to silently eliminate any threat to those they owe allegiance to, their reputation precedes them. An enemy marked by the ambushers seldom lives to tell the tale.

**Master Hunters.** Navigating the challenging terrain of the northern woods demands not just strength but also a unique understanding of the land. The ambushers are survivalists, trained from a young age in tracking, trapping, and hunting. They are equally known for their uncanny precision with the crossbow, a weapon they've mastered over countless years. Their shots, always taken from the shadows, strike their targets with pinpoint precision.

**Dark Allegiances.** While their skills often find them in the service of royalty, protecting borders or scouting enemy lines, the woodland ambushers also have a darker side to their allegiances. It's whispered that they serve the enigmatic dark crones of the woodlands. These mysterious figures, wielding ancient and arcane powers, often call upon the ambushers to enforce their will upon the woods.


**The Wolfhearts.** This elite unit of ambushers is revered and feared in equal measure. Not just satisfied with ranged combat, the Wolfhearts have honed the deadly art of close-quarters combat. With swift agility, they employ nets in battle, trapping and incapacitating foes before finishing them off with point-blank crossbow fire. Their emblem, a wolf's heart, is a symbol of  unmatched prowess and unyielding courage.

### Woodland Ambusher Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these elite hunters in your games:

##### Woodland Ambusher Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Wounded Ambusher:** While exploring the woods, the party stumbles upon a wounded ambusher. Helping him might earn the party a powerful ally in the forest, but it also draws them into the internal politics and feuds of the Ambushers.|
|  2  | **The Forbidden Ritual:** Whispers speak of a ritual the dark crones are planning to perform that could threaten the entire region. The Woodland Ambushers are divided on their stance. The party must decide whether to intervene and how best to navigate the conflicting loyalties of the Ambushers.|
|  3  |**The Hunter's Game:** The party, while traversing the woods, becomes the target of a deadly hunt organized by a rogue faction of Ambushers seeking to prove their prowess. The players must survive and turn the tables on their hunters. |
|  4  | **The Foul Forest Shrine:** A group of woodland ambushers have taken to worshipping a corrupted nature spirit, building a shrine to it deep in the forest. The players must find and destroy this shrine while dealing with the twisted ambushers who protect it. |
|  5  | **The Wolfheart's Vendetta:** A member of the elite Wolfhearts holds a personal grudge against one of the player characters or their allies. The party is constantly harassed and ambushed by the Wolfhearts, leading to a confrontation with this elite warrior.  |
|  6  | **The Crones' Deception:** The dark crones of the woods have manipulated the Ambushers into believing the party threatens their sacred sites. As a result, the party faces relentless attacks and must find a way to dispel this deception or confront the crones themselves.|

### Woodland Ambusher Tactics
&emsp;**Initiating Combat.** As their name implies, ambushers always wait until they have the element of surprise and an environmental advantage before engaging in combat. They initiate their attack from a distance, preferably with rough terrain and land features they can use as cover between them and the players.


**Avoiding Melee Combat.** Ambushers avoid melee combat whenever possible, preferring to maintain a distance of at least 60 feet from their targets. This distance hinders most targets from engaging them in melee combat yet allows the ambusher to pursue them if they decide to flee. 

**Spreading Out.** Ambushers never form tight formations; they always spread out from each other, thereby forcing enemies to traverse a significant amount of difficult terrain to reach any single target.

**Retreating.** Ambushers are quick to flee if it's clear the fight is not going their way. If their foes manage to repeatedly thwart their bull's-eye damage bonus, or if they fail to execute a surprise attack on the first turn, they will retreat into dense foliage or other natural cover, aiming to ambush the party later when an opportunity arises. Their high survival skill allows them to easily track down their enemies for a subsequent ambush.

#### Wolfheart Ambushers
Wolfheart ambushers follow the same tactics as regular ambushers, with two notable differences:

**Close Quarters Shooter.** Unlike regular ambushers, wolfheart ambushers are not as averse to being in melee range due to their Close Quarters Shooter ability. This means they are more willing to launch ambushes in environments where they can't initiate from as far away.

**Ambusher's Net.** The ambusher's net serves as an escape tool and a way to enable their bull's-eye ability. When a creature engages in melee combat with a wolfheart ambusher, the ambusher responds by throwing its net on the creature as a bonus action, then shoots at point-blank range. If unsuccessful, the wolfheart ambusher will distance itself from the target, continuing to shoot at it each turn.

### Woodland Ambusher Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from woodland ambushers are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Woodland Ambusher Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
