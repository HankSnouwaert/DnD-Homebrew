# Crocodilians

This family of reptilian predators includes alligators, caiman, and crocodiles. They are amphibious in nature, and many of them excel at hunting fish and other aquatic creatures.  

Though their sizes vary, almost all of them are amphibious ambush predators, lying in wait within the water, and attacking unsuspecting prey that strays too close to the shoreline.  Once their prey is secure within their jaws, they will pull it out  into the deep water where it will have difficulty escaping.

**Rip and Tear.**  Crocodilians have the one of the strongest bite forces in the animal kingdom, capable of shattering bones with a single chomp.  However, for all its power, the jaw of a crocodilian lacks the ability to chew.  Crocodilians overcome this shortcoming by combining their powerful bite with a "death roll."  When a creature is grappled within it's jaws, the crocodilian will rapidly twist and spin its body in the water, allowing it to quickly disable and dismember its prey.

## Alligators
Smaller and faster than their crocodile cousins, alligators live in swampy environments and are capable of withstanding colder climates than the rest of their kin.  Reaching between 10 and 15 feet in length, and weighing in at 500 pounds, alligators pose a significant danger to swamp dwelling humanoids. Despite this, they are often hunted for their meat and valuable hides. 

**Favored Pets.** Swamp dwelling humanoids will sometimes keep alligators as pets or guard animals to protect their territory. An isolated, misanthropic human might keep gators around his swamp shack, lizardfolk druids often create bonds with alligators living amongst their tribe, and swamp dwelling hags may have alligator pets they dote on like spoiled puppies.

## Caiman
Most subspecies of this smaller breed of crocodilian only grow to a modest length of 5 to 10 feet and generally stay under 100 pounds. They live within the riverways of deep jungles and other tropical environments.  Caimans make up for their lack in size by sporting a more heavily armored hide and traveling in highly aggressive groups capable of ripping apart most other creatures in their path.

## Crocodiles
Reaching lengths of over 15 feet and weighing well over 1000 pounds, these monstrous reptiles are the largest of all modern crocodilians. They are the bane of any creature that must drink from or attempt to cross their river homes.  

Unlike alligators, crocodiles cannot tolerate colder climates and are regulated to the waterways of tropical and desert environments; though, unlike alligators, they can tolerate living in saltwater rivers and marshes.  

**Cold Blooded Killers.** Of all the crocodilians, crocodiles are the most prone to attacking humanoids, actively hunting them down as they attempt to gather water.  A few crocodiles can easily terrorize a small village depending on a nearby river for its water supply.  Some humanoids put these deadly predators to nefarious use.  Rivers and moats surrounding a lair can be filled with crocodiles to make the defenses extra deadly, and a watery pit filled with crocodiles makes for a deadly trap as well as a gruesome way of disposing prisoners.

**Saltwater Crocodiles.** Saltwater crocodiles are the largest of all modern reptiles, ruling as the apex predators of the saltwater marshes where they live. They are among the most aggressive of all crocodiles, and anyone who unwittingly stumbles into their territory is immediately viewed as prey.

**Giant Crocodiles.**  These nightmarish beasts are the subject of local myth and legend.    Some giant crocodiles lair deep in long lost jungle ruins and rivers far from civilization.  Others might be summoned by a vengeful druid or other force of nature, and the appearance of a single giant crocodile can drive a whole village out of its newly claimed territory.  


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

In some cultures, crocodiles are seen as divine figures tied to specific gods.  In these situations, a giant crocodile might appear at the behest of one or more gods. They may be sent to test the metal of mortal champions, guard sacred locations, or enact divine punishment upon those who have displeased the gods.

## Deinosuchus
No creature is safe within the primeval rivers of these ancient crocodileans.  Growing to lengths of over 30 feet and weighing over 4 tons, the deinosuchus is a monster that eats other monsters, and it even counts dinosaurs such as the mighty tyrannosaurus  amongst its prey.  May the gods have mercy on any fledgling adventurers that stray near its waters.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

A deinosuchus encountered by humanoids is <br> treated as a creature of legend, subject to terror and veneration.  Lizardfolk hold a particular reverence for these ancient beasts, and a tribe that encounters a deinosuchus will likely worship it as a demigod; protecting it with their lives as they direct its primeval wrath upon their enemies.

## Gharials
These crocodilians are easily recognized by their long, slender jaws and bulbous nose.  Though they reach lengths similar to crocodiles at 10 to 20 feet, they are more petite, weighing less than most alligators at around 350 pounds.  

The slim gharial is the most hydrodynamic of all the crocodilians, trading land speed for increased water mobility. This, combined with their long reaching jaws, makes them excellent at catching fish, which serve as their primary food source.  They also feed on small land animals and  carrion.   

Gharials are among the least aggressive of all the crocodilians towards humanoids.  Unless their young are being threatened, they are unlikely to attack humanoids unless they are being controlled by magical means, serving a druid or other nature spirit, or being driven mad by some sort of corrupting force acting on their environment. 

<br>

> ##### Optional Rule: Tonic Immobility
> Crocodilians can be subjected to a condition called tonic immobility.  This occurs when the croc is held on its back for 15-20 seconds, causing it to temporarily pass out. To represent this in game, if a croc is prone for 3 rounds it falls unconcisous for another 3 rounds before waking back up
