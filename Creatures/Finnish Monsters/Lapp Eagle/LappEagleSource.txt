## The Lapp Eagle


Within the frigid lands of the dead, in kingdoms ruled by the deathless a construct compared to no other was forged, fires bellowed within the frozen land fueld by the souls of thousands of mighty warriors and the rarest of mystical metals were melted down and re-forged by a shamanistic blacksmiths whose names have long been forgotten to the living. After centuries of toil the Lapp Eagle was created.

The apocalyptic construct manifests as a colossal bird of prey, constructed from metal that perpetually seethes with heat and crackles with electricity. It possesses talons shaped like bladed sickles, capable of easily gripping a mammoth within each one, with lightning dancing between each razor-sharp claw. Its mouth, large enough to snap the thickest trees in half, harbors malevolent flames within its metallic throat when opened. Those fortunate enough to survive an attack from the creature's beak are branded by the magical heat, making them susceptible to intensified pain from any flame thereafter. With a wingspan of 200 feet and metal feathers each the size of a man and as sharp as a greatsword, its presence is overwhelming. The creature's metallic screech causes even the most seasoned warriors to hesitate, and those of weaker resolve to freeze in terror. Not even the most ancient dragons can compare to the sheer terror and devastation wrought by the presence of a Lapp Eagle soaring through the skies.

Although formidable in its own right, the Lapp Eagle's most deadly aspect is its role in the war between the living and the dead. Created by the forces of the dead, this titanic bird serves not only as a weapon of mass destruction but also as a carrier for their army. Embedded within each of its massive metal feathers is the soul of a long-deceased soldier.

With a violent flap of its wings, the Lapp Eagle can launch these feathers like missiles, akin to spears fired from a ballista. Upon landing, typically slicing through anything in their vicinity, the feathers begin to twist and contort, morphing into suits of metal armor. Encased within these armors are ghastly flames that manifest as spectral figures. These undead warriors, with bladed limbs integrated into their metallic exoskeletons, then commence a rampage, slicing through any living being in their path. The eagle is capable of unleashing a relentless barrage of these feathers, which it continually regenerates as molten metal drips from its body, forming new plumage.

The Lapp Eagle is a creature of myth, believed to herald the downfall of ancient civilizations whenever it crosses into the mortal realm. It is said that this can happen under specific conditions, such as when death and suffering in the lands of the living become so overwhelming that they weaken the barrier between this world and the next, allowing the Eagle to pass through. Others believe it requires summoning by a highly skilled and powerful shamanistic blacksmith through an eldritch ritual. The exact nature of this ritual, or why anyone would invoke such a cataclysmic force into our world, remains a mystery. No legend recounts the Eagle's defeat. Some stories suggest it is merely banished back to the realm of the dead by a cohort of powerful sorcerers, while others say that the barriers between the worlds strengthen once more, forcing the Eagle and its army to retreat. However, many seers foretell a day when it will invade our world again, this time unable to be repelled. They predict that the Lapp Eagle

>

>
> ***Spell Eater.*** If the eagle's saving throw against any spell that targets only the eagle succeeds or if a spell attack made against the eagle misses, the spell has no effect on the eagle and ends. The eagle then regains hit points equal to 5 times the spell's level (NOTE: cantrips?).
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The eagle makes two attacks: one with its talons and one with its beak.
>
> ***Beak.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d8 + 10) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it is branded for the next minute. While branded, the target loses any resistance to fire damage, and the first time each turn it takes fire damage, it takes an extra 11 (2d10) fire damage. The creature can make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of its turn to end the effect. Any effect that removes a level of exhaustion also removes the brand.
>
> ***Talons.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +17 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (4d6 + 10) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 26).

>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Ghastly War Cry (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** Each lapp soldier within 300 feet of the eagle that can hear it can make a melee weapon attack as a bonus action until the start of the eagle's next turn.
>
> ***Dread Screech.*** Each creature of the eagle's choice that is within 300 feet of the eagle and can hear it must succeed on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened, the creature can't cast spells other than cantrips. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more, it is also paralyzed until the fear ends. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the eagle's Dread Screech for the next 24 hours.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> 
> The eagle can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The eagle regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
> 
> ***Blade Rush.*** The eagle may move up to 20 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. It is unaffected by difficult terrain and can pass through walls created by spells during the movement. At the end of this movement, each creature and object that isn’t being worn or carried within 5 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage.
> 
> ***Check.*** The eagle makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
> 
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the eagle is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
> 
> ***Bladed Feather.*** The eagle flaps its wings violently, sending one of its metal feathers at a point it can see within 300 feet of it. The point must be more than 30 feet away from the eagle. Each creature within 5 feet of the point must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) fire damage. A lapp soldier appears in the nearest unoccupied space to the point. Lapp soldiers created this way take their turns after the eagle on each round, one after another. The eagle can have up to 100 Soldiers summoned by this ability at one time. (NOTE: Only costs one legendary action?)

### The Lapp Eagle's Lair

Though the Lapp Eagle doesn't have a lair in the traditional sense, you can opt to have an otherworldly storm with a 300-foot area centered on the eagle wherever it goes, which can act as its lair. 

While in its lair, the Lapp Eagle's challenge rating is 30.

The storm possesses an Intelligence of 18 and autonomously acts in the eagle's best interest. It is sentient and knows the location of any creature within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can invoke one of the following magical effects; the same effect cannot be used consecutively:

* **Thunderous Command:** A resounding thunderclap fills the air. The lair selects any number of lapp soldiers that can hear the clap. Each chosen soldier can immediately use its reaction to move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks and then make one melee weapon attack.
* **Lightning Conduit:** A bolt of lightning strikes down from the storm at a designated point. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or take 16 (3d10) lightning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. Any creature, other than a lapp soldier, within 5 feet of a lapp soldier at this point has disadvantage on the saving throw.
* **Gust of Cinders:** A searing gust of wind sweeps through the area. Each creature within the storm takes 5 (2d4) fire damage. Creatures attempting concentration saves due to this damage do so with disadvantage. Additionally, the wind disperses gases and vapors.

##### Lapp Eagle Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Lapp Cult:** Rumors spread of a cult that seeks to summon the Lapp Eagle to bring about the end of the world. The adventurers must infiltrate this cult, learn the secrets of the eldritch ritual, and either prevent the summoning or prepare the world for the Eagle's arrival. |
|  2  | **The Underworld Forge:** The adventurers discover clues leading to the last known workshop of the shamanistic blacksmiths who created the Lapp Eagle.

|  3  | **The Deathly Rifts:** Strange rifts between the mortal world and the realm of the dead begin to open, and the adventurers are tasked with closing them. As they travel from one rift to another, they learn that these are precursors to the arrival of the Lapp Eagle, and they must find a way to strengthen the barriers before the Eagle itself can pass through.|
|  4  | **The Fallen Feathers:** Following a violent storm, a village discovers several of the Lapp Eagle’s feathers near their homes, which transform into spectral warriors. The adventurers must defend the village and find a way to either destroy these feathers or use them to learn more about the Lapp Eagle's weaknesses.|

### Lapp Eagle Tactics 

The Lapp Eagle possesses formidable physical prowess, but its primary objective is to deploy the army it carries. It strategically avoids direct combat unless necessary, focusing instead on effectively using its abilities and spells from a distance.

**Long-Range Engagement:** When more than 120 feet away from the enemy, the eagle uses the following tactics:
* It targets three or more deadly enemies or any serious threat that has been incapacitated by its Dread Screech ability using its once-per-day spells.
* If no significant threats are present, or if potential targets are not adequately clustered, it casts *firewall* unless already concentrating on another spell; otherwise, it opts for *lightning bolt*.
* The eagle frequently uses its Bladed Feather legendary action to disrupt spellcasters and ranged attackers in the backline.

**Close-Range Combat:** If an enemy engages in melee or if the lapp soldiers are quickly being neutralized, the eagle employs the following tactics:
* The eagle shifts to using its talons and beak for direct attacks, focusing on the most significant threats or exploiting paralyzed targets to maximize damage.
* If three or more lapp soldiers are within 30 feet of each other, the eagle may reposition to provide them tactical advantages, such as allowing soldiers to benefit from enemies being restrained by its talons or branded by its beak.
* If fewer than two soldiers are available and no safe landing spots are present, the eagle may grasp an enemy and fly upward. On the following turn, it will ascend as high as possible, attack, and then drop the enemy to inflict maximum fall damage—unless it notes the enemy has resistance to bludgeoning damage.

**Strategic Use of Soldiers:**
* The eagle reserves its Ghastly War Cry for when four or more lapp soldiers can strike effectively or when multiple soldiers can target a paralyzed enemy.
* Lapp soldiers prioritize enemies that are restrained, branded, or paralyzed by the eagle to enhance their combat effectiveness.
