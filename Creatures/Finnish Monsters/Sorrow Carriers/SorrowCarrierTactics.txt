> ***Death Sorrow.*** When the sorrow carrier dies, it releases the sadness it was carrying. The nearest humanoid creature within 100 feet of the sorrow carrier must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) psychic damage and becoming overcome with sorrow on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one without becoming overcome with sorrow. A creature overcome with sorrow has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks if another creature is within 5 feet of it and isn't incapacitated. A creature can take an action to make a DC 13 Wisdom (Insight) check, ending the sorrow on a success.

### Different Types of Sorrow
Sorrow bearers can have different types of sadness stored within them, representing the different types of sadness they have collected. This can make an encounter with different sorrow bearers more interesting as the players have to contend with the different types of sadness and their effects.

A regular sorrow bearer carries the Sorrow of Betrayal by default, but you can switch it with any of the sorrows listed below.

A creature can only suffer from one type of sorrow at a time.


#### Sorrow of Betrayal
 *The creature feels the heavy burden of betrayal by those it once trusted, causing unease towards those who approach.*

The creature suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks when another creature is within 5 feet of it and is not incapacitated.

#### Sorrow of Loneliness

*The creature experiences profound abandonment, finding the presence of companions insufficient to stave off the feeling of isolation.*

NOTE: This is missing

####  Sorrow of Failure
 
 *The creature endures the anguish of failing an important task or duty, with every misstep or defeat plunging it deeper into despair.*
 
Whenever the creature misses an attack or fails a check, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

#### Sorrow of Grief
*The creature feel the dread of losing someone close to them that they care dearly about, losing or seeing anyone, friend or foe, up on the brink of death sends a creature into a panic.*

Whenever the creature witnesses another creature dying or being reduced to 0 hit points, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

### Sorrow Carrier Tactics
Sorrow carriers behave reactively and possess limited intelligence, focusing on guarding a specified area or object or delivering their sorrow to a designated location. 
<Br>

**Attack Pattern.** Their behavior in combat is generally predictable and follows the following order:

* Start by inflicting the initial transgressor (usually the creature at the forefront of a group) with sorrow.
* Work your way through the group, inflicting everyone with sorrow.
* Once everyone is inflicted with sorry, focus on the nearest creature suffering from disadvantage caused by the specific type of sorrow the carrier spreads.

**Retreat.** Upon being reduced to one-third of their maximum health (approximately 17 HP), sorrow carriers will attempt to flee. This instinctual retreat is driven by their imperative to prevent the dispersal of the sorrow they bear into the broader world.

### Sorrow Carrier Loot
The valuable items looted from sorrow carriers will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Carverâ€™s Tools) check to harvest the wood scraps from the sorrow carrier



#### Sorrow Carrier Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | 1 5gp Item |
|  6-9  | 1d4(2) 5gp Items |

|  17-21 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items  |
