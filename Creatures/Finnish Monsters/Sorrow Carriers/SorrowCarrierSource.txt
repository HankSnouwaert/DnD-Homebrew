## Sorrow Carriers 

Sorrow carriers are macabre and bizarre constructs. At first glance, they might appear to be slightly larger than an average raven when viewed from a distance. However, upon closer examination, their artificial nature becomes evident. They are constructed from a framework of bones and wood, held together by materials such as yarn, leather, or sinewy tendons. Their wings are crafted from strips of cloth and black feathers, creating an eerie yet intricate appearance.
Instead of traditional beaks, sorrow carriers feature thin, needle-like protrusions. These needles are connected by intestines or vines to a large container within the creature's chest cavity. This container can vary in material, ranging from clay pottery to leather bags, and serves as a core component of their function.

Sorrow carriers possess a unique ability to absorb and dispose of woe and misery from mortal beings. This encompasses a wide range of sadness, whether it stems from the loss of a loved one, failure in duty or service, or betrayal by a trusted individual. Through an extraordinary procedure, sorrow carriers can alleviate these emotional burdens, offering a peculiar form of relief to those they encounter.

**Taker of Anguish.** A sorrow carrier employs its needle-like beak to penetrate a person overwhelmed by grief, extracting the emotions and storing them in its internal container. This procedure significantly alleviates the afflicted individual's emotional burden, making them feel as though a significant weight has been lifted from their shoulders.

However, this process is not without its potentially lethal risks. The container within the sorrow carrier holds a pure, concentrated form of sorrow it has extracted. If the sorrow carrier is destroyed and its container breached, this concentrated sorrow seeks out the nearest individual to inhabit. This sudden transfer can overwhelm the recipient with intense anguish in an instant, potentially causing severe mental trauma or even death to those unprepared for such a potent influx of emotion.

To mitigate these dangers, sorrow carriers are <br> compelled to dispose of the collected sadness in remote, isolated locations. Some of this sorrow is deposited at the borders of dark, otherworldly realms, while other portions are delivered to specially constructed wells. These wells are repositories of immense misery and sorrow, and any who drink from them or fall into their depths are subjected to unimaginable despair.

**Mysterious Purpose & Origin.** The origins and purposes of sorrow carriers remain shrouded in mystery. These constructs traverse the lands, offering relief to those burdened by emotional pain, transporting these emotions to the farthest reaches of the world and even beyond. The creators of these beings and the entities they currently serve are subjects of speculation and rumor. There are whispers suggesting that sorrow carriers were fashioned by malevolent entities from shadowy realms, implying that their apparent acts of kindness—removing sadness from individuals—mask a more sinister agenda. It's speculated that these harvested emotions serve a darker purpose.

Among the most unsettling legends is the notion of a Raven Goddess, a deity characterized by her dark, destructive love, who is particularly fixated on the heartache associated with romantic love. This has led to observations that sorrow carriers often appear to those suffering from the pains of love. A theory exists suggesting that by removing an individual's pain, the person doesn't learn from their experiences or the consequences of their actions, thereby dooming them to repeat their mistakes and perpetuate a cycle of destructive love.

For those curious about the ultimate fate of the emotions collected by the sorrow carriers, their quest often ends in vain. Locations where these emotions are believed to be discarded are fiercely guarded by numerous sorrow carriers. Intruders risk being attacked by these constructs, which inject them with a fraction of the stored sorrow, overwhelming them with despair. To encounter a group, or "murder," of sorrow carriers, is to endure profound misery.

### Different Types of Sorrow
Sorrow bearers can have different types of sadness stored within them, representing the different types of sadness they have collected. This can make an encounter with different sorrow bearers more interesting as the players have to contend with the different types of sadness and their effects.

A regular sorrow bearer carries the Sorrow of Betrayal by default, but you can switch it with any of the sorrows listed below.

A creature can only suffer from one type of sorrow at a time.


#### Sorrow of Betrayal
 *The creature feels the heavy burden of betrayal by those it once trusted, causing unease towards those who approach.*

The creature suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks when another creature is within 5 feet of it and is not incapacitated.

#### Sorrow of Loneliness

*The creature experiences profound abandonment, finding the presence of companions insufficient to stave off the feeling of isolation.*

The creature has disadvantage on attacks and checks unless at least one of the creature's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

####  Sorrow of Failure
 
 *The creature endures the anguish of failing an important task or duty, with every misstep or defeat plunging it deeper into despair.*
 
Whenever the creature misses an attack or fails a check, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

#### Sorrow of Grief
*The creature feel the dread of losing someone close to them that they care dearly about, losing or seeing anyone, friend or foe, up on the brink of death sends a creature into a panic.*

Whenever the creature witnesses another creature dying or being reduced to 0 hit points, it suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the end of its next turn.

##### Sorrow Carrier Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The Sorrow Theft: A powerful figure hires the adventurers after experiencing a strange form of theft: their capacity to feel sorrow has been stolen, leaving them emotionally imbalanced and dangerously detached. The party must track down a rogue sorrow carrier that's absorbing emotions not to alleviate pain, but to serve a darker purpose.|
|  2  | The Wells of Despair: Rumors tell of wells filled with the pure essence of sorrow, where Sorrow Carriers dispose of their collected woes. When a well near a village overflows, the inhabitants begin to succumb to overwhelming despair.    |
|  3  | Echoes of the Past: The party encounters a Sorrow Carrier that is centuries old, carrying the sorrows of a long-forgotten tragedy. This ancient sorrow begins to seep into the land, resurrecting ghostly apparitions and reliving the events that led to the construct's creation.  |
|  4  | Harvest of Tears: An alchemist has discovered a way to manipulate the essence of sorrow collected by Sorrow Carriers, intending to use it as a component in a powerful elixir. However, the alchemist's experiments have unintended consequences, leading to outbreaks of acute melancholy in nearby towns.  |


### Sorrow Carrier Tactics
Sorrow carriers behave reactively and possess limited intelligence, focusing on guarding a specified area or object or delivering their sorrow to a designated location. 
<Br>

**Attack Pattern.** Their behavior in combat is generally predictable and follows the following order:

* Start by inflicting the initial transgressor (usually the creature at the forefront of a group) with sorrow.
* Work your way through the group, inflicting everyone with sorrow.
* Once everyone is inflicted with sorry, focus on the nearest creature suffering from disadvantage caused by the specific type of sorrow the carrier spreads.

**Retreat.** Upon being reduced to one-third of their maximum health (approximately 17 HP), sorrow carriers will attempt to flee. This instinctual retreat is driven by their imperative to prevent the dispersal of the sorrow they bear into the broader world.

### Sorrow Carrier Loot
The valuable items looted from sorrow carriers will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Carver’s Tools) check to harvest the wood scraps from the sorrow carrier



#### Sorrow Carrier Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Sorrow Carrier Loot Table

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | 1 5gp Item |
