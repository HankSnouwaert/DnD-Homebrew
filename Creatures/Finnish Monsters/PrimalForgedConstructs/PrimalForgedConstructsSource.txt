## Primal Forged Constructs

In the ancient world, the distinctions between druids, artificers, and necromancers were blurred, if not entirely non-existent. These figures, often revered as great shamanistic blacksmiths, navigated the delicate veil separating the living from the dead. Through their journeys across these realms, they accumulated not only profound mystic knowledge but also a diverse array of rare materials. This confluence of spiritual insight and physical resources culminated in the creation of what came to be known as primal forge constructs.

These constructs were formidable entities, pieced together from wood, bone, and stone, giving life to these inanimate amalgams by infusion of spirits of wild predators. This process birthed hulking beasts that bore the ferocity and primal essence of the natural world within their fabricated frames.

The master creators of these primal forge constructs have long since faded into history, their names forgotten and their techniques lost to time. Despite the disappearance of their creators, many of these majestic beasts still exist. Hidden away in the remotest wildernesses, they are remnants of a bygone era, embodying the mystical fusion of both the natural and unnatural.

### Chaining The Beasts
Efforts to replicate the ancient technique behind the creation of primal forged constructs have consistently failed among contemporary artificers and wizards. 

Yet, a breakthrough of sorts has been achieved by some ingenious artificers who have developed specialized chains capable of binding these formidable creatures to their will.

Employing these chains is no trivial matter. It requires an individual, whether brave or reckless, to dare approach one of these ferocious constructs and securely fasten the chain around its neck. Success in this perilous endeavor allows the individual to exert a form of control over the construct, rendering it docile and obedient.

Once subdued, the primal forged constructs are kept in secure locations by their new masters, ready to be unleashed when the need arises. To deploy the construct, its keeper simply removes the chain and issues a command, which must be executed immediately for the construct to respond. The nature of these commands is crucial; they must be simple and direct, as anything complex or ambiguous will not be understood, leading the construct to revert to its wild state.

This precarious balance of control has led to the use of primal forged constructs as tools of intimidation and coercion. Owners often threaten to unleash their constructs on communities or foes, saying they can command the beast to "destroy that village" or "kill the king" unless their demands are met. However, these threats are frequently bluffs, as the degree of control one can exercise over these primal entities is greatly exaggerated.

### Iron Track Wolves

Among the myriad of primal forged constructs, a renowned variant is the iron track wolf. These formidable constructs are created by imbuing the spirits of pack dire wolves into a meticulously crafted frame made of wood, iron, and bone. The name "iron track wolf" derives from their unique ability to influence the very earth they roam. As these wolves tread, metal is drawn from the depths of the earth to the surface, trailing behind them.

The most astonishing aspect of the iron track wolf's power is its ability to manipulate these metallic deposits. Metal fragments in the wolf's wake are like living plants, growing into iron and copper brambles with thorns as sharp as any forged spear. Over time, these metallic growths transform remote areas into glades of twisted metal. Many have been lured by the prospect of harvesting these "iron plants," only to meet their demise amidst the deadly thorns.

The physical prowess of the iron track wolf is not to be underestimated. It possesses an extraordinarily powerful bite, capable of crippling any foe caught in it. Yet, it is the wolf's howl that is truly fearsome — a chilling blend of the calls of baying wolves and the sound of scraping metal. This haunting noise instills an uncontrollable fear in those who hear it, driving them to flee in panic, only to find themselves ensnared in a labyrinth of twisted metal barbs, with the relentless wolf closing in from behind.

### Earth Breaker Bears
Among the designs of primal forged constructs, the earth breaker bears stand as both the rarest and most formidable. These majestic constructs are adorned with a coat of moss and aged leather, and are equipped with teeth and claws crafted from stone or iron. Within their imposing frames resides the spirit of a tyrant polar bear, granting them a profound connection and immense power over the earth itself.

The earth breaker bears are the pinnacle of ancient artificers' craft. In the absence of their original creators to guide and command them, many of these bears have retreated into the depths of the earth, entering a state of eternal hibernation. However, their peace is easily disturbed; unsuspecting excavators who unwittingly awaken these slumbering beasts often meet a tragic end as the constructs lash out in a frenzied rampage, laying waste to everything in their vicinity before once again seeking refuge beneath the earth.

For those daring or fortunate enough to subdue an earth breaker bear, they serve as a powerful weapon. These constructs possess the ability to manipulate the very ground beneath them, shattering earth and stone with a mere swipe of their formidable claws. This power enables the earth breaker bear to execute surprise ambushes, emerging from beneath the ground to unleash a shower of debris capable of halting an entire unit of soldiers in their tracks.

Even more awe-inspiring is the bear's roar, which echoes the terrifying force of an earthquake or an avalanche. This sonic assault leaves adversaries shaken and dazed, with some unable to move, rendering them helpless before the might of the ursine construct.

#### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

>
> ***Stunning Roar (1/Day).*** The bear emits a magical roar. Each non-construct creature within 120 feet of the bear and able to hear it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature loses concentration and becomes dazed. If it fails by 5 or more, it is stunned instead. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Earth Smash (3/Day).*** The bear slams the ground, causing a tremor. Each creature on the ground in a 20-foot cube originating from the bear must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 19 (3d12) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

### Primal Construct Tactics
#### Iron Track Wolf Tactics
Iron track wolves initiate combat with an ambush, leveraging their iron growth ability to encircle foes with a ring of thorns, effectively trapping them. They target the individual with the lowest Strength for their initial bite attack. They use their terrifying howl to drive enemies into the iron thorns. 

This tactic is ideal when the wolf assesses that it can ensnare two or more targets within the thorny trap. The wolf remains mobile throughout the encounter, continually generating new thorny areas to control the battlefield and hinder its opponents.

#### Earth Breaker Bear Tactics
Earth breaker bears launch their attacks from underground, surfacing to immediately unleash their stunning roar, followed by an earth smash. They prioritize attacking the largest cluster of enemies, moving to maximize the impact of their assaults and control the flow of the battle. The bears use their abilities in a calculated manner to incapacitate and disperse groups of foes, maintaining pressure and exploiting the chaos caused by their surprise emergence and powerful attacks.


### New Magic Item

#### Chain of Command

This 15 ft. long chain is designed to subdue and control primal forged constructs, linking them to the wielder's will. NOTE: What counts as a primal construct?

**Attaching The Chain.** While holding the chain with both hands, you can use an action to attempt to attach it to a primal forged construct within 5 feet. This action is only possible if the construct is incapacitated, restrained, grappled, surprised, or has half its hit points or less.

If the construct is incapacitated or surprised, the chain automatically attaches to it. 

If the construct is not in these states, it can use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack with advantage against you. After the attack is resolved, you can make a contested Strength (Athletics) check against the creature. If the construct hits you with its reaction attack, you have disadvantage on this check. On a success, you attach the chain.

**Commanding Creatures.** Once the chain is attached, the construct becomes incapacitated until you give it a command. So long as the chain is attached, the creature must obey any commands given by whoever is holding the chain. 

Whoever is holding the chain can use an action to detach it or to command the construct. The construct will attempt to fulfill any given command to the best of its ability. Commands must be simple and general, like "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." 

**Breaking Free.** After completing the command or after one hour, the construct regains its independence. During the command execution, the construct resists any attempt to reattach the chain. (NOTE: I don't understand the last two sentences. Does it automatically break free after you give it a command?)

### Primal Forged Constructs Loot
The valuable items looted from these constructs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Smith’s Tools) check to harvest metal.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Primal Forged Construct Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
