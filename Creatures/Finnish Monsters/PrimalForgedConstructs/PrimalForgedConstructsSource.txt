> ***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The wolf has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
>
> ***Magic Weapons.*** The wolf's weapon attacks are magical.
>
> ***Spell Eater.*** If the wolf succeeds on a saving throw against a spell that targets only the wolf, or if a spell attack misses it, the spell has no effect on the wolf, the spell ends, and the wolf then regains hit points equal to 5 times the spell's level.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 39 (6d10 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it can't stand up until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Terrifying Howl (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The wolf emits a howl that terrifies prey. Each creature within 120 feet of the wolf must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. A creature frightened this way can't cast spells. If it fails the saving throw by 5 or more, the creature can't take reactions and must take the Dash action and move directly away from the wolf on each of its turns. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Iron Growth (3/Day).*** Until the end of the turn, any land the wolf moves across is covered in iron thorns for one minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels. A prone creature moving within the area takes 21 (6d6) piercing damage for every 5 feet instead. The wolf ignores the effects of the thorns.

>
> ***Animated Construct.*** The bear is infused with the spirits of the dead. Its type is undead in addition to construct when determining the effects of features such as a paladin’s Divine Smite.
>

>
> ***Tunneler.*** The bear can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 15-foot-wide, 15-foot-high tunnel in its wake.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The bear makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage.
>
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (5d10 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Stunning Roar (1/Day).*** The bear emits a magical roar. Each non-construct creature within 120 feet of the bear and able to hear it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature loses concentration and becomes dazed. If it fails by 5 or more, it is stunned instead. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Earth Smash (3/Day).*** The bear slams the ground, causing a tremor. Each creature on the ground in a 20-foot cube originating from the bear must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 19 (3d12) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is not knocked prone. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

#### Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

### New Magic item

#### Chain of Command

This 15 ft. long chain is designed to subdue and control primal forged constructs, linking them to the wielder's will. NOTE: What counts as a primal construct?

**Attaching The Chain.** While holding the chain with both hands, you can use an action to attempt to attach it to a primal forged construct within 5 feet. This action is only possible if the construct is incapacitated, restrained, grappled, surprised, or has half its hit points or less.

If the construct is incapacitated or surprised, the chain automatically attaches to it. 

If the construct is not in these states, it can use its reaction to make a melee weapon attack with advantage against you. After the attack is resolved, you can make a contested Strength (Athletics) check against the creature. If the construct hits you with its reaction attack, you have disadvantage on this check. On a success, you attach the chain.

**Commanding Creatures.** Once the chain is attached, the construct becomes incapacitated until you give it a command. So long as the chain is attached, the creature must obey any commands given by whoever is holding the chain. 

Whoever is holding the chain can use an action to detach it or to command the construct. The construct will attempt to fulfill any given command to the best of its ability. Commands must be simple and general, like "Attack that creature," "Run over there," or "Fetch that object." 

**Breaking Free.** After completing the command or after one hour, the construct regains its independence. During the command execution, the construct resists any attempt to reattach the chain. (NOTE: I don't understand the last two sentences. Does it automatically break free after you give it a command?)

### Primal Constructs Tactics
#### Iron Track Wolf Tactics
Iron track wolves initiate combat with an ambush, leveraging their iron growth ability to encircle foes with a ring of thorns, effectively trapping them. They target the individual with the lowest Strength for their initial bite attack. They use their terrifying howl to drive enemies into the iron thorns. 

This tactic is ideal when the wolf assesses that it can ensnare two or more targets within the thorny trap. The wolf remains mobile throughout the encounter, continually generating new thorny areas to control the battlefield and hinder its opponents.

#### Earth Breaker Bear Tactics
Earth breaker bears launch their attacks from underground, surfacing to immediately unleash their stunning roar, followed by an earth smash. They prioritize attacking the largest cluster of enemies, moving to maximize the impact of their assaults and control the flow of the battle. The bears use their abilities in a calculated manner to incapacitate and disperse groups of foes, maintaining pressure and exploiting the chaos caused by their surprise emergence and powerful attacks.

### Primal Forged Constructs Loot
The valuable items looted from these constructs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Smith’s Tools) check to harvest metal.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Primal Forged Construct Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
