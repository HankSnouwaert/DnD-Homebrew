## Black Iron Dogs
Black iron dogs are the greatest tools a shamanistic blacksmith can create, servants of unmatched power and loyalty. With a heart of iron, organs made of brass, and flesh made of copper, coated with hair made from black steel, they exude a grim presence as their eyes and throat burn with intense heat when aroused to anger.

These hounds serve a critical role for the greatest blacksmiths, venturing into faraway lands to fetch rare ingredients for magical crafting. Sent out in packs, their intellect is far greater than most constructs, and they possess a fierce loyalty to their creator. This means they are never deterred from their goal and will not be persuaded to betray their creator, able to act completely autonomously from their master. They are also equipped with supernatural senses, allowing them to sniff out magic and pinpoint even the rarest ingredients.

Not only are the dogs used for their tracking abilities, but they also serve as guards. With their supernatural senses and fierce iron bodies, few foes can get past an iron dog, let alone a pack. Beyond their terrible metal jaws and natural pack tactics, they can unleash a howl that heats the air before them, making any metal in the area burn red hot, cooking any that are in contact with it.



**Furnace Stomach.** Perhaps the most disturbing feature of these beast-like constructs is their ability to open their jaws at a 90-degree angle, allowing them to swallow substantially large objects or creatures into their spacious metal stomach. Inside the stomach, objects can be stored and carried back to their master. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The hound can also serve as a furnace; often, these hounds are sent to find rare magical ores, and on their trip back, after finding these resources, their stomach burns hot, melting down the newly found prize.  Ultimately, they defecate the slag byproduct and vomit up purified metal. They can also dispose of foes this way, cooking them in their metal stomach until there’s nothing but ash to cough up.

### Vile Iron Dogs
Vile iron dogs are a variant designed for the macabre purpose of gathering ingredients for poisons and other toxic substances. The furnace stomach of a regular iron dog is replaced with an advanced chamber capable of producing toxins as any alchemist's lab would, extracting and recombining anything it has consumed. Some poisoners who own these dogs do not stop at having their constructs gather ingredients and produce poisons; they also use the hounds to deliver these deadly substances.

Many chieftains and warlords pay poisoners who own a vile iron dog to eliminate a rival clan or a particularly powerful warrior. When dispatched on such a task, the dog will find its target and bite down, swallowing it. If the creature survives, it is subjected to the deadly concoction the dog has created, which can overcome even the most legendary of warriors. Additionally, these creatures have the terrifying ability to regurgitate the poisons they've created in a gaseous form, covering a large area. This toxic cloud is potent enough to sicken and kill even the most battle-hardened warriors.

A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the iron dog, and it can't teleport out of the stomach. At the start of each of the iron dog's turns, it can choose to have each creature in its stomach take 22 (5d8) fire damage. A creature trapped inside the iron dog can make a DC 15 Strength check as an action. On a success, one swallowed creature of its choice is freed, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the iron dog. If the iron dog dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ***Heated Howl (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The iron dog emits a wave of heat in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor or holding a metal object have disadvantage on the saving throw.

> ***Toxic Breath (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The iron dog exhales a breath of poison in a 30-foot cube originating from it, filling the area with fog that lasts for one minute or until strong wind disperses it. The area is lightly obscured. When a creature ends its turn in the area or enters the area for the first time on a turn, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 (5d8) poison damage and is poisoned for one minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Black Iron Dog Tactics
Black iron dogs possess the ability to perform basic reasoning and think independently. Despite this autonomy, they are unwaveringly loyal and will not betray their master's interests. The two scenarios in which the players are most likely to clash with black iron dogs are situations where the dogs are guarding an area or where the dogs are competing with the players for a resource they are trying to gather.

#### Guarding an Area
&emsp;**Pack Tactics.** While guarding a territory, black iron dogs operate in groups of three or more so they can employ pack tactics. They work together to isolate and surround targets, giving them advantage on attacks.

**Swallowing Foes.** The dogs will work together to each swallow one of their attackers. By diving up enemies this way, they can keep any individual dog from being surrounded.

**Heated Howl.** If the dogs see three or more adversaries close to each other, or at least two adversaries with one wearing metal, they prefer utilizing their heated howl ability over engaging in melee combat. 

#### Resource Collection
In their role as collectors, black iron dogs are tasked with acquiring specific objects. They focus on swiftly seizing these items and retreating without delay.

**Encountering Resistance:** In situations where an item is already in the possession of a creature, the dogs have a simple countermeasure: they swallow the creature to retrieve the item, then promptly evacuate the area with both the item and the creature. This direct approach ensures the fulfillment of their retrieval mission while minimizing prolonged conflict. 


#### Vile Iron Dog Tactics
The only tactical difference with vile iron dogs is their poison breath. They use this ability when they can target two or more adversaries simultaneously. Their toxic breath serves a secondary purpose as area control, as they can't be damaged by their own fog.

### Iron Dogs Loot

The valuable items looted from iron dogs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Smith’s Tools) check to harvest metal.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Iron Dog Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Black Iron Dog Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1d6(3) 5gp Items |
|  8-10 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items | 
|  11-17 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items  |  
|  18-21 | 1d4(2) 20gp Items |  
|  22+ |  1d6(3) 20gp Items |  

##### Vile Iron Dog Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-6  | 2d4(5) 5gp Items |
|  7-9 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items | 
|  10-16 | 1d4(2) 20gp Items  |  
|  17-21 | 1d6(3) 20gp Items |  
|  22+ |  2d4(5) 20gp Items | 

#### Example Iron Dog Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names. You can choose the burning or toxic descriptor based on whether the creature is a black iron hound or a vile iron hound.


##### Example Iron Dog Item Names
|1d4 | 5gp Item | 10gp Item | 20gp Item |
