> ***Aura of Warmth.*** The hirvi sheds dim light out to 20 feet. Friendly creatures within the light have resistance to cold damage and advantage on Constitution saving throws that would deal cold damage on a failed save. Additionally, if a creature spends its whole short rest in the light and regains hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d4 hit points for each hit dice they spend during the rest.

> ***Charge.*** If the hirvi moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

That creature may use its reaction to move up to its movement speed towards the hirvi without provoking attacks of opportunity. This movement is not reduced by levels of exhaustion. If the target ends this movement within 20 feet of the hirvi, it regains 13 (3d8) hit points and has a level of exhaustion removed.

> ***Aura of Numbing.*** The hirvi sheds dim light out to 20 feet. Creatures that regain hit points within the light regain only half that amount. Any creature that ends its turn in the light must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) cold damage and gains a level of exhaustion, and on a success, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. Creatures immune to cold damage are immune to this aura's effects.

> ***Luring Chase (3/Day).*** The hirvi targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with hunting the hirvi until the hirvi uses this ability again. An obsessed creature knows the hirvi's location if they are on the same plane of existence and cannot be slowed by exhaustion. If the target is more than 10 feet away from the hirvi, it must move on its turn toward the hirvi by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet, and can then take the rest of its turn as normal. The creature doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain or whenever it takes damage from a source other than the hirvi, the target can repeat the saving throw. An obsessed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully saves is immune to this hirvi's Luring Chase for 24 hours.

#### Obsessed 
The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

### Hirvi Tactics

Hirivi utilize hit-and-run tactics. They charge in with their horns before running out of reach to repeat the process on their next turn, using their Back Kick against anyone who makes an opportunity attack against them.
Additionally, they can use their Guiding Warmth ability to help position allies, such as by pulling vulnerable targets out of danger or helping melee creatures get into combat.

#### Hiiden Hirvi Tactics
Hiiden hirvi do best in perilous combat environments, such as snowstorms, icy lakes, or areas with significant obscurity or hazards. They prefer ambush tactics and will try to single out and isolate vulnerable targets from a group, such as fragile spellcasters.

##### Wearing Down Pursuers
The signature tactic of the hiiden hirvi is to wear down foes while goading them into pursuit. Below are a few things to keep in mind when the hirvi is being pursued.
* Ensure that the pursuer is ending its turn in the hirvi's aura.
* Don't engage in melee combat with a target that's a more formidable melee fighter; such targets should be drawn into pursuit.
* If a target not under the influence of Luring Chase is catching up with the hirvi, use a charge attack to try and knock it prone before retreating out of range.


#### Master Hirvi Tactics

Master hirvi command herds of creatures, such as elk, caribou, or other types of deer, and will usually have at least three creatures with it that can benefit from its abilities. 

* Prioritize taking down ranged attackers.
* Creatures enhanced with Might of the Herd should focus on bringing down high-priority targets (such as ranged attackers).
* Coordinate the herd's movement so they all benefit from Hunter's Bane; creatures should try to end their turn in the aura whenever possible.

##### Master Hirvi Retreat
How and when a master hirivi retreats can vary from one to the next. Some view themselves as too valuable to the herd's overall survival to risk death and will retreat if the battle turns unfavorable, potentially sacrificing their fellow deer to secure their escape. In contrast, other Hirvis are deeply committed to their herd, willing to sacrifice themselves to ensure the safety and escape of the rest of their herd.

## Hirvi Loot

The valuable items looted from hirvi will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Hirvi Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
