## Hirvi

Hirvi are mythical constructs fashioned in the likeness of moose, elk, or reindeer, composed of wood, branches, and grass. Within their intricately knotted and woven bodies shines a faint light, centered around a small fire that animates them and captivates any who behold it. These creatures roam the frozen forests and tundras of the world, serving as guides to travelers, leading them either to safety or to perilous, icy ends.

Regarded as lost constructs, legends suggest that the hirvi were crafted by ancient tribes who ventured into the harshest, frozen reaches of the world, where scarcity made traditional beasts of burden impractical. The creators of the hirvi, skilled artificers, designed them to endure the extreme cold and to protect the tribe from the harsh climate. The fate of these pioneering tribes and the origins of the hirvi remain shrouded in mystery.

**Guides and Guardians.** Hirvi are now encountered wandering the frigid regions of the world, where they may come across travelers in need. Upon finding such individuals, a hirvi offers assistance, either by guiding them to safety or by allowing them to warm themselves by its side for a while. The warmth and light emanating from a hirvi's core not only possess the ability to heal frostbite and wounds within minutes but also imbue those in its presence with a revitalizing effect. This vitality enables those who bask in the hirvi's light to endure and navigate through the harshest cold, pushing onward to safety. After providing aid, a hirvi invariably returns to the secluded cold of the wilderness, disappearing as mysteriously as it appeared.

 > ##### Mythological Inspiration
> The hiirvi here are inspired by creatures from Finnish folklore. However, the master hiirvi (described later in the document) are a blend of inspirations from Finnish folklore and Innu mythology.

### Hiiden Hirvi

The hiiden hirvi, also known as the Goblin’s Elk, is a darker counterpart to the benign Hirvi constructs. These variants are the creation of malevolent entities residing in the darkest, coldest reaches of the world. They emerged when ancient tribes ventured into these forbidding territories with the assistance of their hirvi constructs. It is believed that these malevolent forces crafted their own versions of the hirvi as a cruel means of mocking the incoming tribes.

Unlike the hirvi, which houses a warm, glowing fire in its chest, the hiiden hirvi's chest emits a dim blue light. This eerie luminescence chills anything it touches. Moreover, the invigorating effect associated with the light of a typical hirvi is perverted in the hiiden hirvi; instead of revitalizing those who see it, this light instills an irresistible urge to follow the creature. The hiiden hirvi exploits this compulsion, luring its victims into deadly snowdrifts and blizzards, turning it into a perilous beacon in the frozen wilderness.

Any creature that ends its turn in the light must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) cold damage and gains a level of exhaustion, and on a success, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion.

> ***Luring Chase (3/Day).*** The hirvi targets one creature it can see within 120 feet of itself. The target must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed with hunting the hirvi until the hirvi uses this ability again. An obsessed creature knows the hirvi's location if they are on the same plane of existence and cannot be slowed by exhaustion. If the target is more than 10 feet away from the hirvi, it must move on its turn toward the hirvi by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet, and can then take the rest of its turn as normal. The creature doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain or whenever it takes damage from a source other than the hirvi, the target can repeat the saving throw. An obsessed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully saves is immune to this hirvi's Luring Chase for 24 hours.

#### New Condition: Obsessed 
The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, <br> which becomes a source of its obsession. Being <br> obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see a source of its <br> obsession, it can't target any creature or <br> object with an attack, spell, or ability <br> except for a source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see a source of <br> its obsession, it can't cast spells or use <br> abilities that target an area (such as the <br> *fireball* spell) unless a source of its <br> obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away <br> from a source of its obsession.

### Master Hirvi

In rare instances, a hirvi experiences a profound sense of longing and loneliness, driving it to seek companionship beyond its solitary existence in the frozen wastes. These unique hirvi are drawn to deer herds, where they find a sense of kinship. Over time, they integrate themselves into these herds, forming deep attachments and becoming fiercely protective of their new companions. The herd gradually accepts the hirvi as one of its own, marking a transformation in the hirvi. It becomes a guardian of the group, and its powers evolve beyond those of a solitary hirvi. The magic it emanates adapts to the needs of the herd, allowing the hirvi to spend lifetimes caring for its adopted family.

These hirvi guard their surrogate herds with unparalleled ferocity, defending them against predators, including humanoid hunters. The enhanced physical endurance and strength of a master hirvi set it apart from its kin, and the light it emits can deflect the arrows and spears of hunters. Furthermore, the hirvi can imbue members of its herd with extraordinary vigor, turning even a caribou's charge into a deadly force capable of pulverizing bone.

\columnbreak

Beyond physical prowess, these hirvi are more intelligent and cunning than any deer and hold complete obedience and loyalty from the herd. This allows the hirvi to lead its herd with remarkable coordination, evading hunters' traps or even orchestrating counterattacks against local populations.

Many who live near a herd protected by a master hirvi choose not to confront the creature, recognizing that only legendary hunters could possibly challenge such a formidable leader, especially with the support of its kin. Instead, many locals come to revere the hirvi, building shrines and offering tributes to it and its herd. In some cases, the master hirvi may permit limited hunting of its kind, on the condition that their habitat is respected, preserved, and safeguarded against external threats beyond the hirvi's control.

However, there are instances where master hirvi become overzealous, disrupting the natural balance of their territories. Predators such as wolves may begin to starve, unable to prey on the protected herds. Human settlements can be devastated, trampled under the hooves of caribou or elk herds, forcing residents to flee their homes. In response to these disruptions, druids or other guardians of nature often seek adventurers to address the imbalance, aiming to curb the overly protective instincts of these master hirvi and restore harmony to the land.

### Hirvi Tactics

Hirivi utilize hit-and-run tactics. They charge in with their horns before running out of reach to repeat the process on their next turn, using their Back Kick against anyone who makes an opportunity attack against them.
Additionally, they can use their Guiding Warmth ability to help position allies, such as by pulling vulnerable targets out of danger or helping melee creatures get into combat.

#### Hiiden Hirvi Tactics
Hiiden hirvi do best in perilous combat environments, such as snowstorms, icy lakes, or areas with significant obscurity or hazards. They prefer ambush tactics and will try to single out and isolate vulnerable targets from a group, such as fragile spellcasters.

##### Wearing Down Pursuers
The signature tactic of the hiiden hirvi is to wear down foes while goading them into pursuit. Below are a few things to keep in mind when the hirvi is being pursued.
* Ensure that the pursuer is ending its turn in the hirvi's aura.
* Don't engage in melee combat with a target that's a more formidable melee fighter; such targets should be drawn into pursuit.
* If a target not under the influence of Luring Chase is catching up with the hirvi, use a charge attack to try and knock it prone before retreating out of range.


#### Master Hirvi Tactics

Master hirvi command herds of creatures, such as elk, caribou, or other types of deer, and will usually have at least three creatures with it that can benefit from its abilities. 

* Prioritize taking down ranged attackers.
* Creatures enhanced with Might of the Herd should focus on bringing down high-priority targets (such as ranged attackers).
* Coordinate the herd's movement so they all benefit from Hunter's Bane; creatures should try to end their turn in the aura whenever possible.

##### Master Hirvi Retreat
How and when a master hirivi retreats can vary from one to the next. Some view themselves as too valuable to the herd's overall survival to risk death and will retreat if the battle turns unfavorable, potentially sacrificing their fellow deer to secure their escape. In contrast, other Hirvis are deeply committed to their herd, willing to sacrifice themselves to ensure the safety and escape of the rest of their herd.

## Hirvi Loot

The valuable items looted from hirvi will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Hirvi Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
