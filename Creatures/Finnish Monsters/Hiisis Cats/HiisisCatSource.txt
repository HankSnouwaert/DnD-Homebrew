## Hiisi's Cat

NOTE: Can this be called a Hiisi Cat instead?

A hiisi's cat is a peculiar construct resembling a feline the size of a bobcat, crafted from blackened wood that is perpetually ablaze. This unique being is forged from the coffin lids of the deceased, using coals collected from mountainous regions inhabited by cursed spirits. Its sole purpose is to punish thieves by tormenting them until they return the stolen items.

Some hiisi's cats serve as guardians, initially appearing as dormant piles of black wood and coal. They spring to life in a burst of flames when the item they are protecting is taken. These cats possess an innate ability to locate the stolen object and will relentlessly pursue the thief.

In other instances, hiisi's cats are created in response to an item being stolen. Upon their creation, they are informed of the object's nature and instinctively know its location. However, if the ritual to summon a hiisi's cat is performed with the intent of retrieving an item that does not rightfully belong to the summoner, the cat will become enraged and turn against its creator, angered by the deceit.

These constructs are unyielding in their pursuit. Some particularly formidable versions cannot be stopped by destruction; if damaged beyond functionality, their bodies disintegrate into ash. Should the original pyre from which they were created remain intact, it will reignite within a few days, resurrecting the hiisi's cat with renewed determination. The only definitive way to halt a hiisi's cat is by destroying the original pyre from which it was made.

**Cat Scratch Curse.** The claws of a hiisi's cat are a formidable instrument of punishment, functioning not only as red-hot talons but also as a means to inflict a curse upon their victims. This curse subjects the afflicted to a burning pain whenever they come into contact with the object that the hiisi's cat is tasked with retrieving. Furthermore, the curse renders the victim incapable of affecting the object with magic. Should the cursed individual sustain additional scrapes or scratches from the cat, they will experience an intensified surge of searing pain. Only the most adept thieves or warriors stand a chance of retaining the object without succumbing to the overwhelming urge to drop it and flee for their lives.

> ___
>
> ***Bound Object.*** The cat is bound to one object upon its creation. This can be any object its creator owns. The cat knows the direction and distance to its object as long as the two of them are on the same plane of existence.
>
> ***False Appearance.*** While the cat remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pile of burnt wood or a pile of burning wood if its Illumination is active.
>
> ***Inflame (1/Turn).*** The cat deals an extra 9 (2d8) fire damage when it hits a target with a claw attack and the target is cursed by it.
>
> ***Keen Sight.*** The cat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ***Pounce.*** If the cat moves at least 10 ft. straight towards a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage if its Illumination is active. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become cursed; the creature has disadvantage on the save if it is holding, wearing, or carrying the object the cat is bound to. While cursed, the creature's spells can't move or teleport the object. At the start of each of the cursed creature's turns, if it is holding the object, it takes 9 (2d8) fire damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or drop the object if possible. Failing to drop the object halves the creature's speed, imposes disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and prevents it from casting spells other than cantrips until the start of its next turn (NOTE: Does failing mean not dropping it even if you pass on the save?). At the start of each of the creature's turns, if it is not holding the object, it makes a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, ending the curse on a success.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Fetch.*** As a bonus action, the Hiisi's Cat can move up to its speed towards the object it is bound to without provoking opportunity attacks, provided it can see the object.
>
> ***Illumination.*** The cat can choose to shed bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light in an additional 15 feet. It can end the light as a bonus action on its turn.
>
> ### Reaction
>
> ***Scrape.*** If a creature within 5 feet of the cat takes the Disengage action, the cat can make an attack against that creature.




\pagebreakNum

> ***Rejuvenation.*** If the pyre that the hiisi's cat was created from is still intact, a destroyed hiisi's cat gains a new body in 1d4 days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the pyre. NOTE: Why is this not part of the stat block?

### Hiisi's Cat Tactics
The hiisi's cat's primary goal is always the retrieval and protection of the object to which it is bound. Its primary strategy involves stealthily approaching any individual in possession of the object and using its claws to inflict a curse. If the cursed individual drops the item, the cat will seize the opportunity to grab the object and attempt to flee.

#### Engaging In Combat

In situations where escape is hindered by the presence of one or more enemies, the hiisi's cat will engage in combat to achieve its objective. When forced into a confrontation, it instinctively targets ranged attackers, quickly closing the gap to prevent their escape and leveraging its Scrape reaction to make escape hazardous. The cat then concentrates its efforts on the selected target, exploiting its ability to induce inflamed pain through its attacks.

### Hiisi's Cat Loot
The valuable items looted from hiisi's cats will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Carver’s Tools) check to harvest the wood scraps from the hiisi's cat.

#### Hiisi's Cat Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Hiisi's Cat Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-6  | 1 5gp Item |

|  19-22 | 1 10gp Item  |  
|  23+ |  1 20gp Item |  
 

#### Example Hiisi's Cat Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.
