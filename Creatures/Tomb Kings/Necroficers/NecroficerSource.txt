## Necroficers

In the crumbling realm of the Tomb Kingdoms, the necroficers stand as the undying masters of artifice and creation. These master artificers, architects, and engineers were the brilliant minds behind the majestic temples, towering monuments, intricate tombs, and the awe-inspiring statues that mark the landscape of the Tomb Kingdoms. They dedicated their lives to crafting these testaments to their civilization’s grandeur, ensuring that their works would endure for millennia.

As their mortal lives drew to a close and they completed their greatest works, these master builders embraced a final act of dedication. Committing ritual suicide, they ensured their remains were meticulously prepared and interred alongside the royalty they served. This act was done with the belief that they would continue to serve and oversee their grand creations in the afterlife. In death, their appearance is both regal and haunting. They don ornate death masks, a symbol of their esteemed status, and are often seen carrying the tools of their trade, the very instruments they were buried with. Notably, they wield wickedly barbed whips, a grim reminder of their once fearsome role as taskmasters, driving laborers to meet their exacting standards.

In life, necroficers were known for their foul tempers and ruthless efficiency. They tolerated no interference and accepted nothing less than perfection. This unyielding obsession has only intensified in death. Many necroficers find themselves in a state of perpetual rage upon witnessing the decay or damage of their once-pristine works. Driven by a relentless desire to restore and preserve these creations, they react with violent fury when any harm befalls their life's work.

Endowed with a rudimentary knowledge of magic by the liche priests, necroficers use this arcane understanding to imbue their creations with runic hieroglyphs, granting them enhancements that defy the limits of mortal craftsmanship. In battle, this mastery becomes evident. Necroficers command and rejuvenate the war constructs of the Tomb Kingdoms, repairing and sustaining these behemoths with a combination of magical incantations and artisanal skill. Woe betide those who dare damage a necroficer’s creation, for they will face the cruel wrath of these undying creators.

### Necroficer Tactics
The necroficers act as frontline support for other undead constructs. They also possess a plethora of out-of-combat spells that can be used to secure places they have built, such as temples or tombs. 

Although necroficers are highly intelligent, they are quick to anger if any of their constructs are destroyed or damaged. This results in them making decisions on which creature to attack based on the amount of damage dealt to its constructs. 

It uses the Wrath of the Creator ability anytime it can reach a target with the ability and hit it. It prioritizes using Restoration on the largest construct present, as this will be the most precious to it. Necroficer Masters save their uses of Fortify for such constructs.

#### Necroficer Visionary Tactics
Necroficer visionaries follow similar tactics to normal necroficers, using Imbue rather than Fortify on the largest construct available. The imbued construct always goes after the target that is the largest threat to itself or positions itself for a Soul Jolt if the enemies are close enough together to be hit by the ability. It has two unique legendary actions it uses under the following circumstances:

**Frenetic Fervor.** This is used similarly to Wrath of the Creator; it will use this ability whenever it doesn't need to use Tenacious Will, or there aren't enough targets for Soul Jolt.

**Soul Jolt.** This is used whenever it can hit three or more targets. Constructs should attempt to position themselves in the largest groups of enemies for this ability.


### Necroficer Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from necroficers come in the form of relics and tools they carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an Intelligence check using proficiency in any type of Artisan's Tools. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Necroficer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
