## Necroscorpions
Deep within the sun-scorched expanses of the ancient Tomb Kingdoms, there lurk the ancient necroscorpions. These formidable constructs, resembling giant scorpions, are a blend of arcane alchemy and masterful craftsmanship, forged to defend the enigmatic realms of the dead.

***Formidable Appearance and Construction.*** Necroscorpions are imposing constructs of stone and enchanted metals; their bodies are the size of a rhino's and adorned with hieroglyphs, sacred sigils, and leering skulls. Their massive claws, capable of cleaving through armor and bone, and long, arched tails armed with deadly stingers, make them a terrifying sight on the battlefield. Inside each construct lies the carefully embalmed body of a fallen tomb priest, whose spirit and residual magical essence give life to these otherwise inert monuments of death.

***Underworld Guardians.*** The peoples of the Tomb Kingdoms believe the underworld to be guarded by monstrous scorpions that serve the gods. The creatures ensure none can prey upon the souls of the dead and that none of those souls escape their realm. Necroscorpions are crafted in the image of these underworld monsters to symbolize their similar purpose in the land of the living. They often include flourishes in their design, such as metallic, skull-like faces and depictions of the underworld etched into their stony carapaces.

***Animating the Ancient Guardians.*** In times of war or when the sanctity of their domain is threatened, the tomb priests of the Tomb Kingdoms call upon these dormant guardians. Invoking ancient rites and channeling their mystical energies, the priests awaken the necroscorpions, whose purpose is to defend the kingdom's borders and sacred sites against all intruders.

***Masters of Ambush.*** Necroscorpions are not just static sentinels; they possess a terrifying ability to burrow and navigate beneath the desert sands. Their approach is heralded by a faint rumbling, moments before they erupt from the ground in a maelstrom of sand and fury, catching their prey off guard. Using their massive claws, they can grasp and rend their chosen target with brutal efficiency.

***Venom of the Damned.*** The venom that drips from their tails is as varied and potent as the magic wielded by the tomb priests whose souls empower these constructs. For instance, a necroscorpion animated by a priest of light magic might unleash venom that burns fiercely, searing flesh and bone with divine radiance. Conversely, a scorpion carrying the essence of a death magic practitioner would have venom capable of sapping the very life force from its victim, leaving behind nothing but a withered husk.

### Additional Types of Venom

The remains of different types of tomb priests encased within necroscorpions can influence these constructs, modifying their venom with the magics known in their unlife. You may choose one of the following abilities to replace the scorpion's standard poison damage and poisoned condition inflicted by its Sting attack.

#### Lore of Light: Radiant Venom
*The scorpion's venom glows white-hot within the victim's veins, causing internal burning and illumination.*

If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it suffers 17 (5d6) radiant damage and begins to glow. On a successful save, it takes half damage and does not glow. While glowing, the creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. Attack rolls against it have advantage if the attacker can see it, and it can't benefit from being invisible. A creature glowing this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) radiant damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success.

#### Lore of Shadow: Mystifying Venom
*The scorpion's sting clouds the victim's mind, causing disorientation and aimless wandering.*

If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) psychic damage and becomes mystified. While mystified, at the start of its turn, it moves in a random direction determined by rolling a d8, continuing until it exhausts its movement, takes damage, or encounters an object or creature. The creature then proceeds with its turn as normal. A creature mystified this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) psychic damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success.

\columnbreak

#### Lore of Death: Leaching Venom
*This venom saps the life force from its target, transferring it back to the scorpion.*

If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) necrotic damage and becomes tainted. On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not tainted. A creature tainted this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage, and if the scorpion has at least 1 hit point, the scorpion regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. On a success, the effect ends.

#### Lore of Tomb Priests: Necromantic Venom
*The priest within the scorpion was a master of necromancy, and the venom now summons spirits from beyond.*

If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it suffers 17 (5d6) necrotic damage and becomes cursed. On a successful save, it takes half damage and is not cursed. Upon being cursed, a **specter** appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of the creature. The specter is obsessed with the cursed creature and acts immediately after the scorpion's turn. A creature cursed this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) necrotic damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success. When the curse ends, or the creature dies, the specter is destroyed.

### Necroscorpion Tactics

&emsp;***The Ambush.*** These constructs have the ability to burrow underground and also appear as inanimate statues when not moving. Both tactics allow them to catch their prey off guard. In an environment with deep sand, the necroscorpion will wait 30 feet beneath the surface for intruders to pass by. When it senses a creature with its tremor sense, it will move up towards its target using its Burst Forth feature to knock enemies prone and gain advantage on all its attacks.


***Attack Sequence.*** The necroscorpion is built to focus its attacks on a single target. It will use both of its claw attacks against a target, prioritizing anyone that has been knocked prone by its Burst Forth feature so that it can keep the target from standing back up if any of the attacks hit. It will then attempt to sting the target. 

If it is unable to hit a target with a claw attack, it will retreat back underground and attempt to use its Burst Forth feature again. If it does have the target grappled, it will use its Pull Apart action on that target next turn. 

If the target is grappled, it will sting it unless the target has already been poisoned, in which case it will sting another target.


#### Venom Variants
Necroscorpions have many types of venom, some of which can alter their tactics:

***Radiant Venom:*** This venom works best with other undead minions accompanying the scorpion. If the necroscorpion manages to grapple a prone target with its claws, it will use its sting against a different target, as the advantage granted by the venom would be redundant.

***Mystifying Venom:*** The stinger attack is generally made against another target that the scorpion does not have grappled to try to get that target to wander off.

***Leaching Venom:*** This venom does not majorly change the tactics of the scorpion. The exception is situations where it is near death and has a target under the effects of the venom, in which case it will burrow underground to regain hit points until the target is no longer suffering from the venom.

***Necromantic Venom:*** This variant does not change the tactics of the scorpion.

### Necroscorpions Loot
The valuable items looted from necroscorpions will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (History)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



\columnbreak

#### Necroscorpions Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Necroscorpion Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  6-7  | 1d6(3) 10gp Items |
|  8-12 | 2d4(7) 10gp Items | 
|  13-17 | 1d6(3) 20gp Items  |  
|  18-23 | 2d4(5) 100gp Items |  
|  24+ |  2d4(5) 200gp Items |  

#### Example Necroscorpion Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.
