## Setara, The Eternal
*Supreme Conqueror From The Ancient Past*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Underdark; **Treasure:** Armament, Individual <br>

Greatest among the ancient pharaohs was Setara, the Eternal, blessed by the gods and founder of the mightiest dynasty of the Tomb Kingdoms. With unrelenting force, Setara brought an end to the civil war that had ravaged the kingdom for years, brutally compelling all noble houses to swear fealty or face merciless destruction. Yet Setara's ambition yearned for far more than uniting and restoring his realm. He marshaled vast armies to expand his domain's borders, leading legions from atop a golden chariot—crafted by the gods in an age when divinity walked the earth. Setara carved bloody paths through his enemies, his blade blazing with the heat of the desert sun. Nations fell under his rule, their wealth and knowledge funneled to his capital, which grew into the greatest city in the world. Monuments to the gods and Setara rose along its streets, their scale and artistry unmatched.

As decades passed, age began to hinder Setara's body, yet he pressed on with his campaign. One day, standing atop a great mount in a land he had claimed after a long-fought war, he gazed at the unconquered horizon and roared with anger that shook the heavens, infuriate that his conquest would be halted not by a superior foe but by his own mortality. Refusing to bow to such a fate, Setara summoned the greatest scholars and priests to form the Order of the Tomb Priests, tasking them with unlocking the secrets of immortality through arcane rituals and alchemy. Their efforts extended Setara's life far beyond natural limits, allowing his empire to continue its expansion, but death still crept closer. Realizing immortality would take lifetimes to perfect, Setara ordered the construction of a pyramid tomb grander than any before it, its walls inscribed with powerful hieroglyphs to ward off vile magics.

As Setara lay dying, consumed by hatred and frustration, his priests vowed he would one day awaken to rule again. With his final, rancor-filled breath, Setara was embalmed and placed in a great sarcophagus, carried deep into the pyramid's heart. His loyal soldiers, fearless in their devotion, were buried alive beside him, accompanying their master into the next world.

As ages passed, many kings sought to escape mortality, each building their own necropolis in hopes of awakening again. But doom crept upon this golden age. Some tomb priests, delving into the darkest arts, raised armies of the dead to seize power from the royal bloodlines. The land plunged into a great war, pitting the living against the undead. At its climax, a devastating curse suffocated the kingdom in a shroud of death, decaying its once-shining civilization. The dead, buried over millennia, rose from their graves, and generations of tomb pharaohs battled for dominance in the ruined realm.

Amid this chaos, the tomb priests realized only Setara could restore unity. His sacred pyramid, protected by its potent hieroglyphs, had withstood the evil permeating the land.

 Breaking the great seals, the priests awakened Setara, who rose with unmatched fury, enraged to find the promise of his golden kingdom broken. Wielding unmatched martial prowess and divine power granted by the gods, Setara swept through the bickering tomb pharaohs. It was not long before they swore fealty to the Eternal King.

Now, Setara seeks to reclaim the lands lost to time, forgotten realms that no longer honor their great ruler. Riding once more on his gleaming chariot, glaive in his mummified hand, Setara, the Eternal, pursues his dream of ruling all—undeterred by death itself.

***Nekoph, Herald of Setara.*** Nekoph, Setara’s most loyal subject, stood unmatched among the Eternal King’s legions. In life, he was not born of Setara’s kingdom but was a slave, taken from frigid, savage lands and forced to fight among the lower warriors in the pharaoh’s vast armies. Yet Nekoph’s towering size and martial prowess soon set him apart, allowing him to decimate Setara’s foes. Despite his foreign heritage, he rose swiftly through the ranks, his unwavering devotion earning the notice of Setara himself, who anointed Nekoph as his personal champion. Wielding a great flail adorned with the skulls of those who defied the pharaoh’s will, Nekoph remained undefeated, crushing any who dared challenge the Eternal King. During Setara’s burial rites, Nekoph accompanied his master into the magnificent pyramid, where he was ritually sacrificed and embalmed, placed beside Setara to await his awakening. Now risen once more, Nekoph stands by his master, his loyalty unshaken, ready to fight with the same fury he wielded in life.

#### Epic Battle: The Chariot of the Gods
If you wish to make Setara into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you may have him ride atop his **Chariot of the Gods** being pulled by 4 **Royal Warhorses**. All together, they have a CR of 27.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Fatigue
>The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.
> 
> **Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.
> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue.

##### Setara, The Eternal Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Tyranny Eternal.** Setara's emissaries inform the inhabitants of a desert settlement that it is in their master's ancient territory and must either submit to his rightful rule or be destroyed. The players must either help them mount a defence or evacuate.  |
|  2  |**Lost & Found.** The players learn that Setara is leading a strike force into the heart of a major city to retrieve one of his possessions from a museum. It could be a relic of great power or Setara's favorite wine cup. |
|  3  |**Talent Aquisition.** After learning of their power, Setara hires the players to slay a rival tomb pharaoh or retrieve a stolen artifact. Should they succeed and prove their worth in this dangerous mission, he plans to have them slain and made into his eternal mummified servants. |
|  4  | **Setara's Awakening.** Setara has been slain in the recent past, and the players are hired to raid his necropolis and quickly retrieve relics of power before he is revived and can bring his wrath down upon them.| 

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Scarab Ward (1/Round).*** If an attack hits Setara, Setara can force the attacker to reroll the attack roll with disadvantage. If Setara fails a saving throw, Setara can reroll it with advantage. In each case, Setara must use the new roll.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Setara makes two Sunblade attacks.
>
> ***Sunblade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (1d10 + 9) Slashing damage plus 13 (3d8) Radiant damage. The target must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 21. <br> **Failure:** The target is Blinded until the end of Setara’s next turn.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Ruler’s Authority.*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 20, one creature within 90 feet of Setara that can hear Setara.  <br> *Failure:* The target falls Prone in prostration, its speed is 0, and it can’t cast spells other than cantrips until the end of its next turn. <br> *Success:* The creature is immune to Ruler’s Authority for 1 minute.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Setara gains three additional actions in combat: Wind Rush, Curse of the Withering Sun, and Soul Crush. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count (losing ties), separate from Setara’s own, if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace any action with Dispel Magic or Tenacious Will, and he can use Tenacious Will even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Wind Rush (Initiative Count 20).*** Setara moves up to 30 feet and slams the ground, unleashing a wave of stinging wind. *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 20 (disadvantage if the target is the only one making the saving throw), each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from Setara. <br> *Failure:* The target takes 10 (3d6) Slashing damage, is pushed or pulled 15 feet (Setara’s choice), and gains one level of Fatigue*.
>
> ***Curse of the Withering Sun (Initiative Count 15).*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 20, one creature within 90 feet that Setara can see and that is not cursed by Setara. <br> *Failure:* The target is cursed for 1 minute. While cursed, the target is Dazed* and emits bright light in a 15-foot radius. At the end of each of its turns, the cursed creature and any creature (except Setara or its minions) within 15 feet of it must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 20. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 10 (2d10) Radiant damage and gains one level of Fatigue*. If the cursed creature succeeds on the saving throw, the curse ends.
>
> ***Soul Crush (Initiative Count 5).*** *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 20 (advantage if the target has an ally within 5 feet), each hostile creature in a 60-foot emanation from Setara. <br> *Failure:* The target takes 16 (3d10) Necrotic damage and gains one level of Fatigue*.
>
> ***Dispel Magic.*** Setara casts *dispel magic* using Charisma as its spellcasting ability.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Setara is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of its turn, Setara can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.
>
> ### Eternal Legion
> When Setara rolls initiative, he chooses a point he can see and calls upon the gods to summon a legion to his command. For the next minute—or until Setara dies—these divine entities, which possess an Intelligence of 18, act autonomously and always in Setara's best interest.
> 
> While this effect is active, the gods are aware of the location of every creature within 120 feet of the chosen point.
> 
> On Initiative Count 21 (losing ties), the gods summon a **Legionnaire of Setara** (described on next page) in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of Setara. Additionally, any Legionnaires of Setara that were destroyed and are within 30 feet of Setara are instantly restored to life at full hit points. Each Legionnaire summoned this way acts on initiative count 0. <br>
> If there are already six or more active Legionnaires when the gods attempt to summon another, Setara must choose one existing Legionnaire to be immediately destroyed. That Legionnaire cannot be restored again by this feature.

### Setara's Tactics

The Setara is a formidable undead commander who excels in battles of attrition, leveraging levels of Fatigue and his Eternal Legion feature to overwhelm opponents.

* **Scarab Ward (1/Round).** Setara uses Scarab Ward each round to mitigate incoming damage or debilitating effects, prioritizing large single attacks (such as a rogue’s sneak attack) or effects from spells over 6th level.

* **Ruler’s Authority.** Targets creatures reliant on mobility, such as rogues or monks, to hinder their combat effectiveness by restricting movement

* **Sun Blade.** Aims to Blind multiple targets, prioritizing spellcasters with low Constitution scores

* **Wind Rush.** This can be used to overwhelm the creature with the most levels of Fatigue that is isolated or to separate a group of three or more enemies, particularly those with low Strength. Be careful, as this can extinguish fires created by his chariot.

* **Curse of the Withering Sun.** Targets creatures that benefit from proximity to allies, such as paladins or those with pack tactics, to negate their group advantages

* **Soul Crush.** Used immediately when available

### Setara, The Eternal Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from Setara come in the form of relics and religious icons he carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Setara, The Eternal Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you're running the epic Form of the Asp version of Khalindra's battle, use the Form of the Asp Loot Table instead of the normal Khalindra loot table.
