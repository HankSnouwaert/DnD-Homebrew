___
> ## Chariot of The Dead
>*Large Chariot, 60 lbs.*
> ___
> - **Armor Class** 17
> - **Hit Points**  90 (12d10 + 24)
> - **Damage Immunities** Poison, Psychic 
> - **Max Speed** 60 ft. 
> - **Steed Capacity** 2 Large creatures
> - **Carriage Capacity** 2 Medium creatures
> - **Constitution Modifier** +2
> - **Challenge** 1 (200 XP)   
> ___
>
> ***Dead Man's Crew.*** If one or more undead creatures riding the chariot or pulling it as steeds would make a saving throw against an effect that turns undead, an undead creature acting as the charioteer may instead make the save on their behalf. If the charioteer succeeds on the save, they all automatically pass the save, and if the charioteer fails, they all automatically fail the save.
>
> ### Steed Actions
> ***Frightful Charge.*** Each undead steed may make a melee weapon attack against each creature it is facing within 5 feet of it. If the chariot moves at least 20 feet in a straight line before the attacks are made, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) damage and each creature hit must then succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the chariot.<br> If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 7), it becomes terrified of the chariot and must use the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the chariot by the safest available route while it is frightened this way, unless there is nowhere to move. <br> A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

>
> ***Trampling Charge.*** When the mummy takes the dash action, it can make an attack with its Cursed Hooves as a bonus action if it has moved at least 20 straight toward a creature right before the attack. If the attack hits, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The mummy can take this bonus action even if it is a controlled mount.
>
> ***Dreadful Mount*** The mummy can take the Dreadful Glare action even if it is a controlled mount.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The mummy can use its Horrifying Glare and makes one attack with its Cursed Hooves.
>
> ***Cursed Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
>
> ***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 9), it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.
