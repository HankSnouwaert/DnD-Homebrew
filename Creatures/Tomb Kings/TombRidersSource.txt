## Tomb Chariots & Cavalry
The ancient tomb kingdoms were masters of using warhorses to gain the edge over their more primitive opponents. These steeds were so prized they were entombed with their riders when they died. When the legions of the tomb kingdoms rise to make war once more, their loyal steeds rise with them and ride out to meet any enemy foolish enough to stand against the deathless legions.

You can use the stats for the warhorse skeleton from the Monster Manual to represent most of these steeds and have them serve as mounts for any of the tomb kingdom infantry.

### Chariots of The Dead

Not only were the tomb kingdoms masters of mounted combat, but they were also among the first civilizations to use chariots in warfare. Because the tomb kings were seen as divine beings, it was forbidden for them to sully themselves by riding on the back of an animal. As such, war chariots were created to carry them into battle, where they could move between important locations to deliver instructions and charge vulnerable foes. War chariots soon came to be seen as a symbol of status among the royalty, with the most powerful tomb kings able to field legions of thundering chariots to crush their foes. 

Great care was taken to preserve these chariots for use in the afterlife, and when the undying tomb legions march to battle, these chariots thunder alongside them. The chariots almost serve as an extension of their undead charioteer’s will, and they are utilized by tomb soldiers and royalty alike with terrifying results. 

Rules for chariots can be found at the end of the document.

### Royal Warhorse Mummy
Most steeds were preserved using the same rituals as common soldiers. However, like their human counterparts, greater rites of preservation were used for those of greater status. The most prized steeds kept by the ancient royalty were given proper rituals of mummification when they died. When these steeds return to the land of the living, they do so with the unnatural vitality and terrifying powers of their royal masters. 

In war, mummified warhorses serve as steeds for the most elite tomb soldiers and pull the chariots of the tomb royalty. Their cursed hooves doom any they strike, and their terrifying equine glare breaks the will of all but the most resolute soldiers. Never tiring of their duty, these elite steeds work in tangent with their undying riders to destroy any that stand against their terrifying charge.

### Desert Storm Riders
The skeletal cavalry of the tomb legions are often used as outriders to harass and harry foes using their speed in conjunction with guerilla warfare. The most feared of these outriders are the legendary Desert Storm riders. This legion of horsemen were notorious for their ability to sweep up great clouds of sand as they rode, which they would use as cover to enable disorienting hit-and-run attacks.

These riders' regiments included melee warriors for running down vulnerable foes and skilled archers for picking apart enemies from a distance. Together, they would often act as a vanguard force that would throw enemy forces into disarray while kicking up great clouds of dust that would make it hard to target or identify the rest of the approaching tomb kingdom army. After the enemy army was broken and routed, the Storm Riders would run down fleeing soldiers, brutely slaying them during their panicked retreat. 

In their new unlife, these riders continue to serve their kingdom, patrolling the desert and running down any would-be intruders. Many adventuring expeditions into the realm of the tomb kingdoms have been cut short by these merciless cavalrymen.

# Chariots

Chariots are iconic vehicles of war, allowing mighty steeds to pull soldier-filled carriages into battle. The number of steeds able to pull a chariot and the number of riders its carriage can support varies from one vehicle to the next. Some are even designed to be pulled by creatures other than horses. Chariots may charge headlong into enemy forces or ride past foes who are then dispatched by scythed wheels and spear-wielding riders. They are often a status symbol, and many warrior generals lead their armies from them. In some cultures, chariots are used for racing or other gladiatorial sporting events. 

The following rules can help you codify ways to use chariots in your games. They can be applied to chariots of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own chariots. The rules here can be applied to most vehicles pulled by other creatures, such as wagons and carriages. At the end of the document, there are some example chariots you can incorporate into your own games.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.



#### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, chariots are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The chariot may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by steeds.

\columnbreak

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.



> ##### Determining Chariot CR
>When building your own chariot, you can determine its CR using most of the creature creation guidelines described in the DMG with the following modifications:
> * Determine its Offensive CR using additional damage per round it grants to its riders and steeds.
> * Determine its Defensive CR using half its HP.
> * Consider other traits it has the same way you would consider creature attributes.
