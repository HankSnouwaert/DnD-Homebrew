## Tomb Riders
The ancient tomb kingdoms were masters of using warhorses to gain the edge over their more primitive opponents. These steeds were so prized they were entombed with their riders when they died. When the legions of the tomb kingdoms rise to make war once more, their loyal steeds rise with them and ride out to meet any enemy foolish enough to stand against the deathless legions.

You can use the stats for the warhorse skeleton from the Monster Manual to represent most of these steeds and have them serve as mounts for any of the tomb kingdom infantry.

### Chariots of The Dead

Not only were the tomb kingdoms masters of mounted combat, but they were also among the first civilizations to use chariots in warfare. Because the tomb kings were seen as divine beings, it was forbidden for them to sully themselves by riding on the back of an animal. As such, war chariots were created to carry them into battle, where they could move between important locations to deliver instructions and charge vulnerable foes. War chariots soon came to be seen as a symbol of status among the royalty, with the most powerful tomb kings able to field legions of thundering chariots to crush their foes. 

Great care was taken to preserve these chariots for use in the afterlife, and when the undying tomb legions march to battle, these chariots thunder alongside them. The chariots almost serve as an extension of their undead charioteerâ€™s will, and they are utilized by tomb soldiers and royalty alike with terrifying results.

> ***Dead Man's Crew.*** If one or more undead creatures riding the chariot or pulling it as steeds would make a saving throw against an effect that turns undead, an undead creature acting as the charioteer may instead make the save on their behalf. If the charioteer succeeds on the save, they all automatically pass the save, and if the charioteer fails, they all automatically fail the save.

> ### Steed Actions
> ***Frightful Charge.*** Each undead steed may make a melee weapon attack against each creature it is facing within 5 feet of it. If the chariot moves at least 20 feet in a straight line before the attacks are made, each attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) damage and each creature hit must then succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the chariot.<br> If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 7), it becomes terrified of the chariot and must use the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the chariot by the safest available route while it is frightened this way, unless there is nowhere to move. <br> A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Royal Warhorse Mummy
Most steeds were preserved using the same rituals as common soldiers. However, like their human counterparts, greater rites of preservation were used for those of greater status. The most prized steeds kept by the ancient royalty were given proper rituals of mummification when they died. When these steeds return to the land of the living, they do so with the unnatural vitality and terrifying powers of their royal masters. 

In war, mummified warhorses serve as steeds for the most elite tomb soldiers and pull the chariots of the tomb royalty. Their cursed hooves doom any they strike, and their terrifying equine glare breaks the will of all but the most resolute soldiers. Never tiring of their duty, these elite steeds work in tangent with their undying riders to destroy any that stand against their terrifying charge.

> ***Trampling Charge.*** When the mummy takes the dash action, it can make an attack with its Cursed Hooves as a bonus action if it has moved at least 20 straight toward a creature right before the attack. If the attack hits, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The mummy can take this bonus action even if it is a controlled mount.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
>
> ***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 9), it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies (but not mummy lords) for the next 24 hours.

### Desert Storm Riders
The skeletal cavalry of the tomb legions are often used as outriders to harass and harry foes using their speed in conjunction with guerilla warfare. The most feared of these outriders are the legendary Desert Storm riders. This legion of horsemen was notorious for their ability to sweep up great clouds of sand as they rode, which they would use as cover to enable disorienting hit-and-run attacks.

These riders' regiments included melee warriors for running down vulnerable foes and skilled archers for picking apart enemies from a distance. Together, they would often act as a vanguard force that would throw enemy forces into disarray while kicking up great clouds of dust that would make it hard to target or identify the rest of the approaching tomb kingdom army. After the enemy army was broken and routed, the Storm Riders would run down fleeing soldiers, brutely slaying them during their panicked retreat. 

In their new unlife, these riders continue to serve their kingdom, patrolling the desert and running down any would-be intruders. Many adventuring expeditions into the realm of the tomb kingdoms have been cut short by these merciless cavalrymen.
