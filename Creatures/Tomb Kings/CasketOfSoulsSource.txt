## Casket of Souls
In the sprawling necropolises of the Tomb Kingdoms, ancient secrets are kept hidden from the prying eyes of the world. Among the most fearsome of these enigmas are the Caskets of Souls. Nestled deep in the heart of the grandest tombs, these artifacts are not only a testament to the Tomb Kingdoms' arcane prowess but also a symbol of their unforgiving justice.

The appearance of a Casket of Souls is truly awe-inspiring. Carved from a single slab of onyx, the casket is adorned with hieroglyphs depicting scenes of eternal torment and divine judgment. On its lid rests golden effigies of vultures, representing the Tomb Kingdom god of the dead watching over the casket to ensure the souls within cannot escape.

Inside, the casket serves as a prison for the souls of those who dared defy or displease the mighty rulers and priests of the Tomb Kingdoms. Instead of granting them the honor of joining their ancestors in the afterlife, these unfortunate beings are condemned to an eternity of torment within the casket, their spirits never to find rest.

When the Tomb Kingdoms march to war, the casket doesn't remain behind. A dedicated liche attendant conjures forth the casket from its resting place to the battlefield. With practiced precision and dark incantations, the liche attendant can momentarily unlock the casket.

As the lid creaks open, vengeful souls pour out like a tempestuous wind, hungry for release and retribution. Directed by the will of the attendant, these souls sweep through the enemy ranks, withering those they touch and tearing the very essence from their victims. Once their brief freedom ends, the attendant's incantations pull them back into their dark prison, along with the new souls they've claimed.

Such is the power emanating from the Casket of Souls that it distorts the very fabric of magic around it. Mages and sorcerers find their spells dissipating or going awry in the artifact's presence. However, with another whispered incantation, the liche attendant can twist this disruption, amplifying the magical prowess of their allies while still hindering their foes.

But woe betide those who believe they can simply destroy the casket and end its threat. If shattered, the built-up wrath and pain of millennia burst forth. Freed souls, in their final moments of liberation, lash out in a blinding frenzy, consuming everything in their path before dissipating into the ether, finally finding the peace denied to them for so long.

In the ever-shifting sands of time, many artifacts and relics are lost or forgotten. But the Caskets of Souls, and the dread they inspire, ensure that the dread power of the Tomb Kingdoms will never be overlooked or underestimated.

### Casket of Souls Mechanics

The casket of souls is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the casket if it has proficiency in the Religion skill and both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 14 or higher. 

A creature attuned to the casket can perform a minute-long ritual to summon it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat a casket of souls with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

#### Unleashing the Souls

The creature attuned to the casket of souls and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the tormented souls within, targeting a creature it can see within 300 feet. The souls can then jump to another creature within 15 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 15 feet of that one. A creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per turn. A targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If a creature fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) or if the damage from this ability reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the casket begins extracting the target's soul. This effect ends if the casket is destroyed. The affected creature repeats the saving throw at the start of the casket user's next turn, with disadvantage if it has 0 hit points. On a success, the effect ends. If the creature fails, it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the casket until the casket is destroyed. While a creature's soul is trapped this way, it can't be resurrected.

#### Arcane Conduit

Additionally, creatures within 150 feet of the casket have a -1 penalty to their spell save DC and spell attack rolls. The creature attuned to the casket can choose for a creature to receive a +1 bonus instead. This modifier remains even if the creature attuned to the casket dies.

#### The Casket's Destruction

If the casket of souls is destroyed, the trapped souls are freed and lash out at all nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the casket must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Casket of Souls Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from liche priests come in the form of relics and religious icons they carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
