> ***Animated Construct.*** The titan is infused with the souls of the dead. Its type is Undead in addition to Construct when determining the effects of features such as a paladinâ€™s Divine Smite.
>
> ***Divine Awareness.*** The titan knows if it hears a lie.
>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The titan is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. 
>
> ***Sleeping Giant.*** While the titan remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue. It is also immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as to all divination spells or other magic that would detect it is a creature. 
>
> ***Turning Defiance.***  The titan has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The titan makes two with its Sun Staff.
>
> ***Sun Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (4d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage plus 13 (3d8) radiant damage.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the titan's choice that is within 120 feet of the titan and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the titan's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The titan casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks):
>
> 2/Day: *burning gaze** (5th level), *spirit leech** (5th level)
>
> 1/Day: *dispel evil and good*, *forbiddance*
>
> **new spell found at end of document*
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Spirit Conduit (3/Day).*** Whenever another friendly creature within 60 feet of the titan would cast a spell of 5th level or lower using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability, the titan may allow the creature to ignore any material component requirements the spell has. Additionally, if the spell has a chance of failing, such as the *commune* or *divination* spells do, the spell can't fail. Finally, if the creature used a spell slot or daily use of an ability to cast the spell, it regains that spell slot or daily use.
