## Titan of the Gods

These massive ornate constructs were built to serve as conduits to the netherworld. They preside over the tombs of ancient kings, ensuring they are guided to the afterlife. In one hand, they wield a massive sun staff that lights the way through the netherworld and allows them to unleash solar rays through their burning eyes. In the other hand, they carry a set of scales used to judge the worthiness of souls and rip apart the life force of those still living. 

When stirred to battle, the titan of the gods serves as an avatar of the divine that walks the mortal realm. Its connection to the realm of the gods allows divine beings to hear the prayers and rituals beseeching them for power more clearly. Those who draw on the gods for power find they can more freely call upon that power in the presence of this titan, and the titan serves as a messenger to communicate the gods' will to their supplicants.

>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the titan's choice that is within 120 feet of the titan and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Battle Magic*** When the titan uses its action to cast a spell, it can use its Frightful Presence and make one Sun Staff attack.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Spirit Conduit (5/Day).*** Whenever another friendly creature within 60 feet of the titan would cast a spell of 5th level or lower using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability, the titan may allow the creature to ignore any material component requirements the spell has. Additionally, if the spell has a chance of failing, such as the *commune* or *divination* spells do, the spell can't fail. Finally, if the creature used a spell slot or daily use of an ability to cast the spell, it regains that spell slot or daily use.
