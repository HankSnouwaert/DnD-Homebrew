The restrained creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn, becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success.

While petrified this way, if the creature takes any damage or is moved, it crumbles into fine sand.

>
> A creature holding a reflective surface that is affected by the gaze at the start of its turn may use its action to reflect the gaze back at the stalker by making a DC 17 Dexterity check; it has a disadvantage on the check if it averted its eyes. If the creature succeeds on check, the stalker is subjected to the effects of its own gaze.

### Tomb Stalker Tactics
Tomb stalkers are ambush fighters who either use their burrowing abilities or False Appearance trait to catch foes by surprise and hit them with their Transmogrifying Gaze. At the end of each of its turns, the stalker will burrow underground, then pop out to attack any player that is either restrained by its gaze or has chosen not to avert its gaze.

#### Eyes of the Desert Tactics
The Living Mirage ability allows these stalkers to play mind games with their foes. There are many ways to use this ability, but there are a couple of tactics to keep in mind:

* The stalker never ambushes with its Living Mirage active, as a creature would be forced to look at it and realize it's a fake. It waits until creatures can choose whether they will look at it and its copy before using the ability.

* The stalker and its double stay near each other, and at the end of each of their turns, they will attempt to burrow back under the ground, moving to different positions. This means that every time one of them emerges from the ground, its opponents will have to guess whether it's the double or the real one. The stalker should switch up each round, varying whether the copy takes its turn before or after the real one so as not to become predictable.

### Tomb Stalker Loot
The valuable items looted from tomb stalkers will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Stalkers Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
