## Dune Stalkers
In the vast, sun-scorched expanses of the Tomb Kingdoms, the dune stalkers stand as silent, lethal protectors of the realm's borders. These enigmatic constructs, part serpent, part warrior, are a fearsome sight to behold. Towering over men, they possess the sinuous bodies of serpents, seamlessly blending into the desert sands, while their upper bodies are those of men, crowned with dread, skull-like visages. The stalkers move with the deadly grace of a serpent while wielding deadly glaives with the skill of veteran warriors.

**Creation of the Dune Stalkers.** Dune stalkers are born from a combination of necessity and arcane prowess. When a veteran warrior of the Tomb Kingdoms falls in battle, and their body is damaged beyond repair, the liche priests may choose to grant the solider a new form of unlife. Through elaborate ceremonies, these priests transfer the warrior's spirit into a specially crafted statue, giving birth to a dune stalker. This process allows the fallen warrior to continue their service, granting them a fearsome and enduring form.

**Guardians of the Pharaoh's Domain.** Tasked with guarding the borders of their tomb pharaoh's territory, dune stalkers are masters of stealth and ambush. With the ability to burrow silently through the sands, they lie in wait beneath the dunes, undetectable to the unwary traveler or invader. When the time for attack comes, they erupt from beneath the sands in a sudden, terrifying assault, using their glaives to dispatch foes with swift precision.

**The Gaze of Petrification.** Perhaps the most dreaded aspect of these guardians is their gaze. Legends say that those who lock eyes with a dune stalker are transformed into statues of sand, their forms left to be scattered and lost amidst the desert winds.

This fearsome ability has given rise to various tales and strategies among tomb raiders and warriors; some speculate that the use of a reflective surface could turn this deadly gaze back upon the dune stalker itself.

### Eyes of the Desert
A unique and even more formidable breed of dune stalkers known as the Eyes of the Desert commands terror and paranoia among those who dare face them. These exceptional guardians possess a cunning and deceptive ability that sets them apart: they can create a simulacrum of themselves, a duplicate crafted from the very sands they patrol. This sand-formed doppelganger possesses the same martial prowess as the original, wielding its glaive with lethal efficiency. However, it lacks the petrifying gaze of its creator.

The creation of these sand duplicates is more than just a display of combat might; it is a sophisticated strategy of psychological warfare. Enemies find themselves in a treacherous game of guessing and second-guessing as they try to discern the true stalker from its simulacrum. Direct observation of the duplicate reveals its sandy nature, but this realization comes with a perilous risk. For if one mistakenly meets the gaze of the true dune stalker, thinking it to be the copy, they fall victim to its terrifying, petrifying power. Thus, the Eyes of the Desert not only dominate the physical battlefield but also the minds of their foes, turning engagements into a deadly dance of illusion, cunning, and raw power.

### Dune Stalker Tactics
Domb stalkers are ambush fighters who either use their burrowing abilities or False Appearance trait to catch foes by surprise and hit them with their Transmogrifying Gaze. At the end of each of its turns, the stalker will burrow underground, then pop out to attack any player that is either restrained by its gaze or has chosen not to avert its gaze.

#### Eyes of the Desert Tactics
The Living Mirage ability allows these stalkers to play mind games with their foes. There are many ways to use this ability, but there are a couple of tactics to keep in mind:

* The stalker never ambushes with its Living Mirage active, as a creature would be forced to look at it and realize it's a fake. It waits until creatures can choose whether they will look at it and its copy before using the ability.

* The stalker and its double stay near each other, and at the end of each of their turns, they will attempt to burrow back under the ground, moving to different positions. This means that every time one of them emerges from the ground, its opponents will have to guess whether it's the double or the real one. The stalker should switch up each round, varying whether the copy takes its turn before or after the real one so as not to become predictable.

### Dune Stalker Loot
The valuable items looted from dune stalkers will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Dune Stalkers Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
