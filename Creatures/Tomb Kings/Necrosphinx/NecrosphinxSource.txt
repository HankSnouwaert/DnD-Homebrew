> ___
> 
> ***Animated Construct.*** The necrosphinx is infused with the spirits of the dead. Its type is Undead in addition to Construct when determining the effects of features such as a paladin’s Divine Smite.
> 
> ***Decapitating Strike (1/Turn).*** When the necrosphinx makes a Blade attack against a creature, it can choose for it to be a Decapitating Strike, forcing the target to make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw before the attack roll is made. If it fails, the attack roll has advantage, and if it hits, it is a critical hit. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 10) or automatically fails, the target is decapitated if the attack hits. If the damage is somehow reduced by 10 or more, the target is Gargantuan, or has Legendary Actions, it is not decapitated.
> 
> ***Immutable Form.*** The necrosphinx is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
>
> ***Impact Tremor (1/Turn).*** If the necrosphinx is flying and dives at least 20 feet in a straight line before landing on the ground, each other creature standing on the ground within 15 feet of it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the creature fails by 5 or more (DC 15) or automatically fails, it can't stand up until the end of its next turn.
> 
> 
> ***Sleeping Giant.*** While the necrosphinx remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue. It is also immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as to all divination spells or other magic that would detect it is a creature.
>
> ### Actions
> 
> ***Multiattack.*** The necrosphinx can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes a Sting attack and a Blade attack against any number of targets in a 15-foot cube originating from it.
> 
> ***Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) slashing damage.
> 
> ***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. A creature poisoned this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success. If the creature fails the repeated saving throw by 5 or more (DC 15), it is paralyzed until the poison ends.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the necrosphinx's choice that is within 120 feet of the necrosphinx and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the necrosphinx's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

> 
> ***Decapitating Strike (1/Turn).*** When the necrosphinx makes a Blade attack against a creature, it can choose for it to be a Decapitating Strike, forcing the target to make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw before the attack roll is made. If it fails, the attack roll has advantage, and if it hits, it is a critical hit. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 12) or automatically fails, the target is decapitated if the attack hits. If the damage is somehow reduced by 10 or more, the target is Gargantuan, or has Legendary Actions, it is not decapitated.

> 
> ***Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) slashing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage. If the necrosphinx hits a creature with two or more hit dice, the fire damage dealt by subsequent Blade attacks is increased by 3 (1d6). This ability can stack up to 15 times and can only gain up to 3 stacks in a single turn. The necrosphinx loses all the damage increases after 1 minute without striking any targets with more than two hit dice.
> 
> ***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. A creature poisoned this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success.

>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the necrosphinx's choice that is within 120 feet of the necrosphinx and aware of it must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the necrosphinx's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
> 
> 
> ### Legendary Actions
> 
> The necrosphinx can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Necrosphinx regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
> 
> ***Blade Rush.*** The necrosphinx may move up to half its speed without provoking attacks of opportunity. At the end of the movement, it may then make a Blade attack against the creature that just took its turn, dealing 12 (1d10 + 7) slashing damage instead of its normal Slashing damage (it still deals its normal Fire damage).
>
> ***Check.*** The necrosphinx makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
> 
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the necrosphinx is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
> 
> ***Consuming Flame (Costs 3 Actions).*** The necrosphinx lets loose a wave of cleansing fire within 120 feet of it, passing through all magical barriers and destroying them. Each creature in the area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 17), any spells it has cast affecting the area or creatures within it immediately end.
