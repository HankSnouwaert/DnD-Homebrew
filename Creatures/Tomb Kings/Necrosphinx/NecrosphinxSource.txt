## Necrosphinxes

The necrosphinxes stand as awe-inspiring yet feared creations. These formidable constructs are an amalgamation of the deadliest creatures from the mythos of the Tomb Kingdoms. They possess the lion-like bodies characteristic of sphinxes, but their forms are further adorned with an array of other animal and humanoid aspects, making them appear as if conjured from a nightmarish vision. Most striking are their arcane wings, which serve a dual purpose; not only do these wings allow the necrosphinxes to soar through the skies, but their edges are honed into massive, blade-like extensions. Additionally, these behemoths often boast giant scorpion stinger tails, capable of delivering a lethal blow to any who dare challenge them.

The creation of necrosphinxes was driven by a desire to embody the pinnacle of predatory might. However, their bizarre and terrifying visages led many pharaohs and priests to view them as blasphemous abominations. It was feared that these constructs, with their amalgamated forms, would incur the wrath of malevolent gods. As a result, the necrosphinxes were buried deep beneath the sands, their existence relegated to whispers and warnings, forgotten by time.

Yet, in moments of dire need, a tomb pharaoh or liche priest might resurrect one of these unholy titans to unleash its fury upon their foes. The most potent binding magics are employed in their awakening, for it is widely believed that the necrosphinxes are not animated by the souls of departed champions but by the will of malevolent deities. Their insatiable lust for destruction is legendary, and a lingering fear persists that, should their bindings falter, the necrosphinxes would turn their wrath upon the Tomb Kingdoms themselves, leaving a trail of ruin in their wake.

In battle, the necrosphinxes are a sight of both terror and majesty. They glide through the chaos of war on wings of stone and metal, striking with the force of a tempest. Their approach heralds doom as they crash into enemy ranks with thunderous impact, their stingers paralyzing prey with deadly precision. With a swift and brutal swing of their bladed wings, they decapitate the mightiest of enemies, spreading fear and awe in equal measure. 

### The Underworld Butcher

This particular necrosphinx stands apart from its kin, not merely for its monstrous form and the terror it inspires, but for the dark legends surrounding its nature. It is said that within this colossal construct stirs the spirit of a god, one so ruthless and bloodthirsty that it was banished to the Underworld by its divine peers. This god’s lingering spirit, filled with eternal rage and thirst for vengeance, animates The Underworld Butcher, turning it into an avatar of destruction, a herald of the Underworld’s fury unleashed upon the lands of the living.

The Underworld Butcher is a terror in battle, its massive, blade-like wings engulfed in the cursed fires of the Underworld. These hellish flames are no mere spectacle; they are a manifestation of the Butcher's unyielding rage, growing more intense and ferocious with every life it claims. The more creatures that fall beneath its sweeping blades, the brighter and more terrifying the flames become, scorching the earth and air around it. It is whispered that the fires possess a cursed property, dooming those touched by them to a fate worse than death - their souls cast down to the Underworld, fueling the Butcher’s infernal power.

On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. A creature poisoned this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, taking 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save and ending the effect on a success. If the creature fails the repeated saving throw by 5 or more (DC 15), it is paralyzed until the poison ends.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the necrosphinx's choice that is within 120 feet of the necrosphinx and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the necrosphinx's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

> 
> ***Blade Rush.*** The necrosphinx may move up to half its speed without provoking attacks of opportunity. At the end of the movement, it may then make a Blade attack against the creature that just took its turn, dealing 12 (1d10 + 7) slashing damage instead of its normal Slashing damage (it still deals its normal Fire damage).
>
> ***Check.*** The necrosphinx makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
> 
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the necrosphinx is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
> 
> ***Consuming Flame (Costs 3 Actions).*** The necrosphinx lets loose a wave of cleansing fire within 120 feet of it, passing through all magical barriers and destroying them. Each creature in the area must make a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 17), any spells it has cast affecting the area or creatures within it immediately end.

### Necrosphinx Tactics
Necrosphinxes are giant, straightforward killing machines. When they see a large group of targets, they'll dive in with their Impact Tremor. They will then choose a prime target for decapitation and target it with a Sting attack before following up with their Blade attack. Their preferred targets are the ones with the most health, such as barbarians, paladins, and fighters.

#### The Sphinx of Usekph
The biggest tactical difference with this sphinx is its new legendary actions. It will use its Blade Rush legendary action to help build up stacks of fire damage on its Blade attacks. If there are multiple enemy spells that all have a combined spell level of approximately 9 or higher, it will use all its legendary actions to use Consuming Flame to attempt to dispel them all.

### Necrosphinx Loot
The valuable items looted from necrosphinxes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Necrosphinx Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Necrosphinx Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-10  | 2d4(5) 500gp Items |
|  11-15 | 2d6(7) 500gp Items |
