# Ushabti

The people of the ancient <br> tomb kingdoms <br> worshipped pantheons <br> of gods who were said to <br> blend aspects of animal <br> and human. They possessed <br> the heads of powerful desert <br> beasts, the bodies of humans, and each <br> presided over their respective domains. <br> The people of these kingdoms created <br> many imposing statues of these deities, and <br> when their priests learned how to preserve <br> and bind the spirits of the fallen, they began <br> the practice of enshrining the spirits of <br> their most powerful warriors within these <br> statues. Known as ushabti, they stand <br> watch over the most important temples <br> and necropolises of the tomb kingdoms, <br> where they remain motionless but ever <br> vigilant. 

Ushabtis awaken only when they detect <br> intruders or hear the summons of a powerful <br> tomb priest. In either case, they stride into <br> battle, wielding giant ornate weapons, from <br> intricately etched blades capable of cutting a horse <br> in half to gilded longbows with blessed arrows the <br> size of spears. Ushabtis use their weapons with ease,  <br>cutting a swath through would-be intruders and invaders, making them the perfect sentries and monstrous soldiers for their eternal kingdom.

&emsp;**Chosen of the Gods.** These ushabtis are <br> possessed by the spirits of mighty archers who <br> have earned the blessings of their gods. While <br> all ushabtis utilize blessed arrows, these <br> warriors are capable of performing miraculous <br> feats with their divine ammunition, such as <br> raining volleys of radiant arrows down upon <br> foes in a deadly barrage. The elevated rank of <br> these archers means they are available only to <br> the most powerful of tomb lords and employed <br> for only the most important of duties, such as <br> providing ranged support in critical battles or <br> protecting the most sacred of temples.

**Soul Wardens.** These ushabtis are built to <br> imprison the souls of those who have earned a <br> special ire from the tomb lords. They are capable <br> of tearing out the souls of their victims and <br> trapping them within their construct bodies. <br> Some transport the souls of the victims to their <br> masters for further punishment, but many serve <br> as a prison for the soul of an especially powerful transgressor, such as a traitorous priest, <br> renegade necromancer, or even a powerful <br> demon. The presence of a tomb warden serves <br> as a grim reminder to would-be tomb robbers <br> that a fate worse than death awaits them should <br> they fall into the clutches of these dreaded <br> guardians.

> ***Capture Soul.*** The ushabti makes one melee attack against a creature. If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or become incapacitated and have its speed become 0 as the ushabti begins ripping the target's soul from its body. This effect ends if the ushabti dies or uses this ability again. The creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If it fails the repeated saving throw by 5 or more (DC 10) the creature dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the ushabti until it the ushabti dies or traps another soul. While a creature's soul is trapped, it can't be resurrected.
