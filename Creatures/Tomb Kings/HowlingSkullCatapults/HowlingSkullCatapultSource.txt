## Howling <Br> Skull Catapults
In the desolate landscapes of the Tomb Kingdoms there exists a weapon of terrifying power and macabre design - the howling skull catapult. These formidable war machines, as much a symbol of dread as they are of destruction, stand as a testament to the dark ingenuity of their creators.

***Eerie Construct and Crew.*** Crafted from a blend of stone and metal, these catapults are fashioned to resemble bones, with macabre motifs and glyphs adorning their structure. Operated by skeletal crewmen, these catapults loom like grim sentinels on the battlefield, their very presence a chilling sight. The crewmen, bound to their eternal task, work with mechanical precision, unfazed by the chaos of war around them of the screaming of the catapult's ammunition.

***Cursed Ammunition.*** This horrifying ammunition is crafted from the skulls of slain enemies, each one subjected to dark rituals by the liche-priests. These incantations imbue the skulls with sorcerous curses, causing them to glow with eldritch flames and emit the tormented screams of their previous life's final moments. The sound of these screaming skulls is not merely the byproduct of their curse but serves as a weapon in its own right.

> ***Screaming Skull.*** Each howling skull catapult has 30 pieces of ammunition built into it that can be removed as needed. This ammunition lets out horrifying screeches that can be heard up to 300 feet away as long as it is within 30 feet of the catapult. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of any screaming ammunition and can hear it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.
>
> On a failure, the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 10), while the creature is frightened, it can't take reactions and must take the Dash action on each of its turns and move away from howling skull catapult by the safest available route.

> ***Prep (2)*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done two times before it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The howling skull catapult fires a skull that is set ablaze and rains down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet and shatters. Each creature in a 15-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) piercing damage. Each non-undead creature within 30 feet of the point must then make a saving throw against the effects of the Screaming Skull feature.

&emsp;***Terrifying Barrage.*** As the catapults launch their ghastly ammunition, the air fills with the harrowing screams of the damned, creating a symphony of terror. Upon impact, the skulls explode in a burst of spectral fire, causing both physical and psychological devastation, as the screams and the violent eruption sow panic and fear among enemy ranks.

### Howling Skull Catapult Tactics 
The best targets for howling skull catapults are melee fighters, as the fear effects of the screaming skulls can prevent them from closing in. Additionally, the constant screaming of the catapult's ammunition means it can create a protected area for other undead ranged units attempting to avoid melee combat.

### Howling Skull Catapult Loot

Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these screaming scull catapults are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Masonâ€™s Tools) check. Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the crewmen come in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Howling Skull Catapult Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

\columnbreak

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.
