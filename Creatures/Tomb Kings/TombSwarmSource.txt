## Tomb Swarms
In the unforgiving sands of the desert and the echoing silence of ancient crypts, a menace lurks unseen. A creeping, crawling, writhing menace emerges from the very ground to consume and annihilate those who dare to trespass on the sacred grounds of the Tomb Kingdoms.

Tomb Swarms resemble a horrifying cascade of skeletal and desiccated small desert creatures, moving as one, with the sole intent of overwhelming their prey. From a distance, they might appear like shifting sands, but upon closer inspection, one can discern the countless creatures that form these swarms, their tiny bones, carapaces, and withered forms glistening under the desert sun or the dim torchlight of a crypt.

***Swarm Composition.*** Comprised of a myriad of smaller undead beings, Tomb Swarms are most notably made up of scarabs and scorpions, though various other small creatures might be found within the mix. Each creature, though small and seemingly insignificant on its own, becomes a formidable force when part of the swarm.

<br><br><br><br><br>

The scarabs are especially feared for their gruesome method of attack, burrowing into the flesh of their unfortunate victims. Once inside, they consume their prey from the inside out, causing immense pain and inevitable death.

The undead scorpions inject a potent necrotic venom with each sting. The poison not only causes excruciating pain but also debilitates the victim, making counterattacks nearly impossible.

***Deadly Ambushers.*** The Tomb Swarms do not exist by mere chance. They are animated by the ambient magic wielded by the liche-priests of the Tomb Kingdoms. In combat, these swarms serve as perfect ambushers, bursting forth from beneath the sands or creeping out of shadowed crypt corners, taking enemies by surprise. 

With an appetite that seems insatiable, Tomb Swarms will skeletonize their surprised prey. The speed at which they devour flesh and bone is unnatural, leaving behind only empty armor and weapons, a grim testament to their efficiency.

### Tomb Swarm Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these undead beasts in your games:

##### Tomb Swarm Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Scarab Gem:** An infamous gem, said to be cursed, resurfaces in the market. Anyone who possesses it is found dead, their body grotesquely skeletonized. The adventurers are tasked with tracing the gem's origin and dealing with tomb swarms it summons.|
|  2  |**Lost to the Swarm:** An earlier expedition into the Tomb Kingdoms has not returned. The adventurers are tasked with finding them. As they explore deeper into the ancient ruins, they find evidence of the expedition's encounters with tomb swarms.  |
|  3  | **Master of the Swarm:** A rogue necromancer seeks to control the tomb swarms for their own nefarious goals. As they conduct dark rituals to bend the swarms to their will, the adventurers must intervene, navigating through the chaos of swarming undead.  |
|  4  | **The Desiccated Oasis:** A once-lush oasis is now completely dry. Those who ventured to investigate never returned. But their last messages spoke of the ground awakening with swarming undead creatures.|

### Tomb Swarm Tactics
Tomb swarms are made up of a mass of mindless undead creatures acting with just enough collective intelligence to maintain a unified cohesion as they hunt. Beyond this, they are mindless in their tactics. They remain hidden in crevasses or underground until they detect prey, then they burst forth for a surprise attack. They focus on attacking the closest prey available, using their numbers to overwhelm and devour their victim.

When in the service of the tomb kingdoms, they act as ambushers designed to surprise and distract high-priority targets such as spell casters.

\columnbreak

### Tomb Swarm Loot
The valuable items looted from tomb swarms will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Swarm Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Tomb Swarm Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | 2d6(7) 5sp Items |
|  6-9 | 3d6(10) 5sp Items | 
|  10-17 | 2d6(7) 1gp Items  |  
|  18-21 | 3d6(10) 1gp Items  |  
|  22+ |  2d6(7) 2gp Items | 


##### Large Tomb Swarm Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 5d6(17) 5sp Items |
|  8-11 | 6d6(21) 5sp Items | 
|  12-19 | 5d6(17) 1gp Items  |   
|  20-23 | 6d6(21) 1gp Items  |  
|  24+ |  5d6(17) 2gp Items | 


#### Example Tomb Swarm Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.

##### Example Tomb Swarm Item Names
 5sp Item | 1gp Item | 2gp Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
 |   Cracked Tomb Carapaces | Tomb Carapaces  |  Pristine Tomb Carapaces  |
