## Khalindra, <br> The Serpent Queen
*Undead Mistress of Venoms & Favored of The Asp God*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Underdark; **Treasure:** Relics <br>
Even after the passing of countless years, the name of Khalindra, the Serpent Queen, is still spoken with great reverence. Her life was tragically cut short, yet legends whisper that her rule has never truly ended.

Khalindra reigned over one of the most prosperous cities in her region, a beacon of wealth and power dedicated to the Asp Goddess. Her cunning and sense of honor were unmatched in her time, and she tirelessly rooted out the evils plaguing her land in the name of her deity. It was this unrelenting pursuit of justice that led to her downfall. Growing suspicious of the neighboring city-state, governed by her cousin, Khalindra questioned their loyalty to the empire that united their dominions. Her fears were well-founded: the nobility of the region had been corrupted by vampires, with her cousin at the heart of this malevolent infestation.

Tensions between the two provinces erupted at a grand state dinner, culminating in a deadly duel between the two ruling women. Though Khalindra was a formidable warrior, her cousin’s newfound vampiric immortality granted her unnatural power. In a brutal clash, Khalindra was mortally wounded. As she lay dying, her cousin attempted to turn her into a vampire, a fate Khalindra refused. In her final moments, she pleaded to the Asp Goddess to spare her such damnation. Her prayers were answered: her blood turned to venom, her vibrant skin became pale as alabaster, and her heart ceased to beat.

With great sorrow, her body was carried back to her grand city. A magnificent tomb was constructed beneath her palace, where she was embalmed and placed upon an ornate throne of intertwining golden serpents with jeweled eyes. A death mask, crafted in the perfect likeness of her radiant face, was adorned upon her. Her mournful followers sealed the vast chamber, and outside, her greatest warriors and servants willingly sacrificed themselves to be entombed, so they might serve their benevolent queen in the afterlife.

Not long after her death, the evil that claimed Khalindra spread across the province and beyond, plunging the empire into wars and famine. Her once-glorious city fell into ruin, its people either fleeing or perishing. Yet it is said that Khalindra, the favored champion of the Asp Goddess, remains bound to this world by her need to enact justice. After decades of resting upon her throne, she rose with the same grace and authority she wielded in life. With a gentle gesture, the great doors of her chamber creaked open, and her loyal subjects rose to stand by her side, wielding venom-tipped weapons. Together, they march forth to exterminate vampires and other creatures of dark necromancy with venomous wrath.

Time and again, Khalindra returns to her chamber after vanquishing unholy spawn, seating herself motionless. Yet the heinous actions of other masters of undeath awaken her from her sepulchral sleep. Legends claim she will rise repeatedly until her treacherous cousin and her abominable vampiric kin are eradicated from the world.

### Avatar of the Asp
The most wondrous sight in Khalindra’s resting chamber is a grand statue dedicated to the Asp Goddess that towers over the queen while she sits serenely on her throne. The statue has the lower half of a serpent and the upper half of a woman, wielding a glaive longer than a fully grown man, its eyes gleaming with emeralds. This monument’s divine presence empowers Khalindra’s return to exact her vengeance. Some rumors suggest that if Khalindra’s body were destroyed, her spirit would fuse with the statue, allowing her to continue her crusade against those who defy her mission.

### Lair of the Serpent Queen
Nestled between jagged, foreboding peaks and a dark, treacherous sea lies a forgotten land along the coastline. Swamps teem with beasts, both living and undead, lurking beneath murky waters that shimmer a sickly green, toxic to any creature not native to this cursed realm. Within this perilous bog sprawls the city of the Serpent Queen, its temples rising like golden beacons, unmarred by time or marauders. Their columns and adornments, fashioned in the likeness of serpents, hiss and writhe at the approach of intruders.


At the city’s heart stands a tomb surpassing all others in size and craftsmanship. Passages snake deep into the earth, their walls inscribed with praises and prayers to the Asp Goddess. Venomous serpents slither along the cold stone floors, darting through fist-sized holes to ambush trespassers. Those who survive this deadly maze reach a vast burial chamber where the greatest champions of the Asp Goddess rest in temporary death, entombed within sarcophagi. Their decrepit bodies, wrapped in snakeskin and clutching venom-dipped bows and spears, await their queen’s call. Beyond lies the chamber of Khalindra herself, where only the foolish would dare disturb her eternal vigil.

#### Lair Action
When Khalindra rolls initiative, her lair awakens to aid her, and until combat ends, the lair has an Intelligence 18 and can act of its own accord but always acts in Khalindra (of the Avatar of The Asp's) best interest. While active this way, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause an Archer of the Asp to appear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the Khalindra or the Avatar of the Asp, which remain for one minute or until destroyed. Archers summoned this way act on initiative count 0 of each round. The if lair attempts to summon a skeletion whilte their are already three or more active Archers, It must choose for one to be immediately destroyed.

\columnbreak

#### Regional Effects. 
The region surrounding Khalindra's lair is affected by her presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

• **Poisoned Waters.** Small bodies of water within 5 miles of the lair become poisonous. A creature that drinks this water must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or become Poisoned for 8 hours. An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each hour, ending the effect on a success.

• **Hate of the dead.** Any undead within 5 miles of the layer lose immunity to the Poisoned condition and immunity and resistance to Poison damage. Khalindra can choose for a undead creatrue not to be effect.

• **Living Statues.** Serpentine engravings and statues within 1 mile constantly writhe and hiss at those who walk in their shadow. These magical objects have an Intelligence of 8, a Wisdom of 16, and a Charisma of 14. They possess hearing and blindsight out to a range of 30 feet.
They can speak and understand Common and communicate telepathically with Khalindra.

While in her lair, Khalindra's challenge rating increases by 3.



### Epic Battle: Form of the Asp

You may choose to have an Avatar of The Asp—an inert magical object—reside within Khalindra’s lair. While inert, it has resistance to all damage and immunity to any magical effects, while retaining its hit points and AC.
When Khalindra dies, you may have her spirit rise from her body and possess the statue. The Avatar of the Asp immediately becomes active and regains all of its hit points, falling under Khalindra’s full control. Her initiative count remains unchanged. 

The avatar may perform an 8-hour ritual in her lair, returning Khalindra to her original body, fully restoring her, or providing a new body if the original no longer exists. Once the ritual is complete, the Avatar of the Asp becomes inert again.

When she has access to this ability, both her forms combined are treated as a CR 23 creature.

### Tactics
Queen Khalindra, the Avatar of the Asp, and their archer minions, focus on using their abilities to maximize sacred poison application. The queen and avatar prioritize spreading sacred poison to multiple targets or focusing on one vulnerable target, while the archer supports with ranged attacks.

#### High Queen Khalindra Tactics
The queen targets enemies who don't have advantage on poison saving throws or with low Constitution saves, avoiding those with both high saves and advantage. She spreads sacred poison across multiple targets early, then focuses on a single poisoned target to reapply sacred poison.

##### Regular Actions
Use Multiattack with Venom Staff if in melee range, or Toxic Bolt if out of range. Target multiple unpoisoned enemies to spread sacred poison, or focus both attacks on one poisoned target. Stay within 30 feet of allied undead to enhance them with My Will Be Done.

##### Bonus Actions
Use Flowing Venom on a low-Dexterity, low-mobility target, preferably those already poisoned. Reuse each turn to keep applying sacred poison until the target escapes or the effect ends.

##### Monstrous Actions
* Use Bestow Toxins on a single creature with no allies nearby or up to three creatures with low Charisma saves and no advantage against poison. Prioritize targets under disruptive spells like *protection from poison*.

\columnbreak


* Use Breath of the Asp to hit the most targets with low Constitution saves and no advantage against poison.
* Use Tenacious Will if afflicted by an ongoing effect to end it immediately.

#### Avatar of the Asp Tactics

##### Regular Actions
Use Multiattack with two Venomous Halberd attacks and one Tail attack. Target unpoisoned enemies to spread sacred poison or a single poisoned target to reapply it. With Tail, pull Large or smaller targets away from allies and Grapple them. Prioritizing low Constitution saves and no advantage against poison. Stay within 30 feet of allied undead for My Will Be Done.


##### Monstrous Actions
* Use Serpent’s Path to cover maximum ground, forcing enemies to cross difficult terrain to reach it.
* Use Breath of the Asp to hit the most targets with low Constitution saves and no advantage against poison.
* Use Tenacious Will if afflicted by an ongoing effect to end it immediately.


#### Archer of the Asp Tactics
The archer supports by applying sacred poison to distant or Poisoned targets, and Khopesh only if forced into melee. Stays at range within the queen’s or avatar’s My Will Be Done aura.

Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from Khalindra come in the form of relics and religious icons she carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.




#### Khalindra, Serpent Queen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you're running the epic Form of the Asp version of Khalindra's battle, use the Form of the Asp Loot Table instead of the normal Khalindra loot table.
