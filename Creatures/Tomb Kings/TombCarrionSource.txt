## Tomb Carrion
In the shadowed dunes and desolate plains of the eternal desert lie the remnants of the once-glorious Tomb Kingdoms. These vast lands are inhabited not only by the buried undead legions but also by the chilling specters of the skies: the tomb carrion.

Tomb carrion are monstrous, reanimated vultures bearing an unholy union of decayed flesh and preserved remains. The scale of these creatures is intimidating, with wingspans reaching that of several men laid end to end. Their desiccated skin clings tightly to their skeletal form, and their lifeless eyes gleam with an eerie light, signaling the dark magic that reanimates them.

In days of old, the giant carrion vultures were revered creatures, considered sacred to the denizens of the Tomb Kingdoms. Seen as messengers and intermediaries between the mortal realm and the heavens, they were embalmed upon their death and preserved with archaic rituals. Thus, the vast necropolises of the empire, home to its departed rulers and warriors, became the resting place for countless such vultures.

The Tomb Kingdoms may have been long silent, but they are far from lifeless. The powerful liche-priests, guardians of ancient rituals and forbidden magics, possess the capability to awaken the embalmed vultures. Summoned forth from their aeons of slumber, the tomb carrion soar the skies once more, providing invaluable aerial support to the ground-bound legions of the undead.

These creatures are not mere tools of war. They are deadly hunters of the arid desert, preying on wanderers and creatures already enfeebled by the scorching sun and relentless sandstorms. With dread inevitability, they descend upon the vulnerable, leaving little but bones in their wake.

But the tomb carrion have evolved beyond mere talons and beaks as weapons. Through the dark rituals that bind them, they've gained the ability to spew forth a vile, necrotic filth. This foul substance weakens their prey, sapping them of strength and vitality, rendering them all the easier to subdue.

Among the tomb carrion, there are those that stand a class apart. These are the blessed ones, chosen by the very gods of the Tomb Kingdoms. These sacred creatures are not only larger and more formidable, but they also possess the unique ability to release torrents of necrotic filth from high above. Like unholy bombers, they soar the heavens, raining down decay and death upon the enemies of the Tomb Kingdoms.

The tomb carrion are a testament to the enduring might and dark majesty of the Tomb Kingdoms. As long as the liche-priests chant their spells and the necropolises stand, these creatures of dread will continue to haunt the desert skies, symbols of an empire that refuses to fade into the annals of history.

### Tomb Carrion Tactics
These vulturous undead specialize in harrying their prey and picking off the weak. 

When operating independently, tomb carrion will track down desert-traveling players suffering from exhaustion and attempt to swoop in to finish them off. They usually initiate with their Spew Filth and then focus their attacks on whoever has the most levels of exhaustion. They will typically stop their attacks to use Feast whenever the opportunity presents itself.

When working with other Tomb Kingdom forces, they will harass and weaken players, focusing on which ever player the other Tomb Kingdom forces may be having the most trouble reaching. They are also good at helping Tomb Kingdom forces catch fleeing foes.

The sacred carrion fight in much the same way as their other kin. The biggest difference is that they have Filth Bombardment rather than Spew Filth. This ability allows sacred carrion to weaken their prey from afar before having to move in closer, where they risk facing stronger counterattacks.

### Tomb Carrion Loot
The valuable items looted from tomb carrion will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Carrion Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Tomb Carrion Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-8  | 1 5gp Item |
|  9-12 | 1d4(2) 5gp Items  |  
|  12-16| 1 10gp Item  |  
|  17+| 1d4(2) 10gp Items  |
