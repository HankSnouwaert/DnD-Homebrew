## Tomb Lords
These monarchs ruled vast <br> kingdoms when civilization was <br> still young. Their ruthless ambition <br> saw them conquer huge territories <br> and amass untold troves of wealth. <br> Their egos were such that they saw <br> themselves as above death. So, they <br> had themselves mummified so they <br> could rule their kingdoms for eternity. <br> However, they’ve awoken to find their <br> bodies as shriveled husks and their kingdoms <br> crumbling and pillaged of treasures. Though <br> they still possess immense physical might, they <br> can no longer enjoy the sensations of life. Though they <br> still have many riches, much of it was stolen. Though they still have loyal subjects, they are undead minions only possessing a shadow of their former selves.

The rage at what they’ve lost and their desire to retake <br> what they feel the afterlife owes them drives the tomb <br> lords ruthlessly reclaim their territory and punish any trespassers in their domain. This indomitable will <br> manifests itself in their undead subjects, who become <br> much more formidable in the presence of their lord.

***Chosen of the Gods.*** The monarchy of these <br> long-lost kingdoms claimed to be divinely blessed, if <br> not the direct descendants of gods themselves. Those <br> struck by tomb lords experience direct evidence to <br> back this claim, for these undying monarchs strike <br> with the divine fury of their patron gods. This blessing <br> may come in the form of poisonous strikes, attacks <br> enhanced with solar radiance, or an onslaught so <br> vicious it mentally scars victims and forces them to <br> drop to their knees in prostration. 

The most sinister of these divine manifestations is <br> not a blessing on the tomb lord but a curse on anyone <br> who strikes it down. These curses reflect the gods <br> who favored the tomb lord and may leave victims <br> racked with poison, unable to recall learned <br> knowledge, or feeling the inevitable pull of death <br> tugging at their souls.

***Tomb Princes.*** Most members of ancient royalty <br> were not destined for the throne. The sons of mighty monarchs who were not heirs to the throne served as commanders and enforcers for their father’s will. <br> Many strive to earn favor with their king, performing <br> deeds in his name as they jockey for positions in the <br> royal hierarchy. Others seek to gather enough power <br> to dethrone their father and take his place at the <br> head of an undying kingdom of their own.

### Additional Curses of the Gods

Many tomb lords have a specific god they regard as their patron. These gods enact divine punishments on those who strike the tomb lord down in a unique way that makes it clear which deity has been angered. You may replace the effects of the tomb prince’s or tomb king’s Vengeful Curse with one of the following curses.

#### Curse of Death's Grip
This is the most common curse tomb lords inflict and is the default curse listed in their stat blocks. The curse is inflicted by gods associated with death and funerary rites. Those under its effect feel the inevitable pull of the grave tugging at their soul.

While cursed this way, the target automatically fails any death saving throws it makes and treats the roll as if it rolled a 1.

#### Curse of the Glaring Sun
Many of the greatest kings of old claimed to be blessed by, or even descendent from, the god of the sun. Those who cut down these monarchs are cursed by the sun’s perpetual glare. 

Whenever a creature cursed this way is in direct sunlight, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

#### Curse of the Lost Lessons
Some monarchs made gods of knowledge their patron deities in hopes of receiving their wisdom. Those who earn the ire of these gods soon find themselves stripped of such wisdom.

The cursed creature can't add its proficiency bonus to skill checks, tool checks, or saving throws.

#### Curse of the Marked Prey
Monarchs who were fierce warriors and hunters earned the favor of gods of the wild. Those cursed by such gods become easy prey to their enemies. 

Weapon attacks against the cursed creature can't suffer from disadvantage.


#### Curse of the Serpent's Kiss
The cursed creature loses any immunity or resistance it has to poison damage and the poisoned condition. Additionally, if this curse originated from a tomb prince, and the creature takes any piercing, slashing, or poison damage, the creature takes an additional 2(1d4) poison damage. If the curse originated from a tomb king, it instead takes an additional 4 (1d8) poison damage.

### Additional Magic Strikes

If you wish to replace the effects of the Tyrannical <br> Strike ability for a tomb prince or tomb king, you <br> can use one of the following effects instead. The <br> save DC for a tomb prince is 15, and for a tomb <br> king, it’s 17. The tomb monarch in the descriptions <br> refers to the tomb prince or tomb king with this <br> ability.

#### Nullifying Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an <br> additional 10 (3d6) force damage. Once per turn, when <br> the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a <br> Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature drops <br> an object of the tomb monarch’s choice, and the tomb monarch can have the object flung up to 10 feet away in <br> the direction of its choice. If the object is magical, its <br> magical properties are suppressed for the next minute. 
 
#### Siphoning Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature gains a level of exhaustion, and the tomb monarch gains advantage on attack rolls and saving throws. These effects last until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. 
 
#### Sun Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) radiant damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is blinded until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. 

#### Tyrannical Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) psychic damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits a creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature falls prone in prostration and is frightened of the tomb monarch until the end of the tomb monarch's next turn or until the tomb monarch is incapacitated. While frightened this way, the target can't stand up.

#### Venom Strike

The tomb monarch’s melee weapon attacks deal an additional 10 (3d6) poison damage. Once per turn, when the tomb monarch hits another creature with a melee weapon attack, it may force that creature to make a Consitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned until the end of the tomb monarch’s next turn. While it is poisoned this way, if it fails another saving throw against a poison effect, it becomes stunned until the end of its next turn.
