# Tomb Kingdom Infantry
Deep within ancient tombs and buried under sandy dunes lie forgotten legions whose loyalty to their bygone kingdoms and undying lords transcends death. These soldiers swore to continue their service into the afterlife and died with their weapons and armor in hand to ensure they would always be ready to answer the call of their eternal lords.

When the undying priests and monarchs of antiquity make war, they summon these regiments of unbreakable undead warriors who tirelessly carry out the orders of their superiors. These skeletal soldiers have forgotten most of their former identities, retaining only their training and their sense of unwavering duty. In battle, they execute the commands of their superiors with flawless devotion, never flinching in the face of danger as they carry out their eternal service.

## Skeletal Infantry
These undead represent the most numerous and lowest-ranking soldiers of the tomb king armies. They were given only the most rudimentary of burial rites, resulting in almost none of their former personality surviving. They possess only the knowledge and skills needed to serve as efficient and loyal soldiers. Though they cannot speak, they can understand and carry out orders with flawless efficiency. Each skeletal regiment retains the years of training and experience with its weapons and combat role that it had in life, and the long years have not dulled their skills.

### Skeletal Spearmen
These soldiers make up the backbone of most tomb king armies. They march in seemingly endless ranks of bone and bronze, wielding ancient spears and impaling every foe before them. Though they are not the most powerful soldiers, they make up for this with numbers and unshakable resolve. Skeletal spearmen will fight against even the most overwhelming odds, never fleeing and fighting to the last soldier. 

#### The Scorpion Legion
The spearmen of this notorious legion are known for crafting their spears from the tails of deadly desert scorpions. These skeletal soldiers wield their venomous weapons with brutal skill, and foes that survive the initial stab will often succumb to the poisonous aftereffects. 

### Skeletal Archers
These warriors served as the ranged support to their ancient armies. Armed with bows and an ever-ready supply of bronze-tipped arrows, these archers rained death on their foes to wound and demoralize armies before they could even engage in melee combat. In death, these archers continue to fulfill their ancient role, unleashing streams of arrows with no thought other than to carry out the orders of their eternal masters.

#### The Hawk Legion
These renowned archers were not only expertly trained soldiers but devoted disciples of the hawk god, whose domains were discernment and the hunt. In exchange for their devotion, the hawk god granted them his heightened senses and blessed their arrows such that they would unerringly find their quarry, regardless of any obstacle.

## Tomb Warriors
In life, these soldiers were among the most fanatically loyal to their monarch. These warriors eschewed the protection of a shield and spear, instead duel-wielding curved blades known as khopeshes to maximize their killing potential. Their khopesh blades allow them to knock weapons out of their foes’ grips, potentially sending them flying out of reach. These warriors then ruthlessly cut down their defenseless victims before continuing their bloody rampage. Tomb warriors have lost none of their fervor in death and continue to charge headlong into battle, headless of any danger.

### Netherworld Legion
When mortals died and passed into the afterlife, it was said their souls would be judged by the discerning gaze of the god of the underworld. Those who displeased this god or were found unworthy would be cast down to the netherworld to suffer for eternity. However, some warriors could bargain for a better fate by offering their service as enforcers of their god’s will in the mortal realm. 

This netherworld legion of warriors can be summoned by those who curry favor with the god of the underworld. Even in the land of the living, they are spectral warriors who flicker in and out of the Material Plane. Their otherworldly nature can even transfer into objects they disarm from foes, preventing their retrieval. And when these warriors are defeated and banished back to the netherworld, they can leave a lingering curse that partially unmoors mortals from the Material Plane.

A creature cursed this way has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws, has the skeleton's Etherealness bonus action, has the skeleton's Ethereal Sight trait, and gains a fly speed of 15 ft. with the ability to hover.
>
>  As an action, a cursed creature can repeat the saving throw to attempt to end the curse. If a creature would return to Material Plane in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, it is immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it is moved.

> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.***  The skeleton makes two spectral khopesh attacks. If both attacks hit the same creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop an object of the skeleton's choice. The object lands at the creature's feet, and if the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 8), the skeleton can have the object flung up to 10 feet away from the creature in the direction of the skeleton's choice. The skeleton can choose for the flung item to enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. The item returns to the plane it was shunted from after 1 minute.
>
> ***Spectral Khopesh.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  12 (3d6 + 2) force damage.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Etherealness.*** The skeleton enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
>




> ##### Option Rules: Binding Curses or Longer lasting Curses
>If you're running an adventure where your players turning ethereal and being able to move through objects would be problematic, you can modify the curse so that creatures under its effects can't move, be moved, or be teleported more than 30 feet away from where the skeleton that cursed them died. On the flip side, if you want to make the curse a key part of how players explore an adventure location, you can extend its duration.

## Tomb Guard
These soldiers served as elite infantry and personal guards to their kings. As a reward for their service, they were granted more elaborate burial rites upon their death. Though these rites were nowhere near the complexity of those reserved for royalty, they allowed the tomb guard to retain some semblance of their personality into undeath. In addition to being excellent soldiers and bodyguards, these soldiers are capable of verbal communication, abstract reasoning, and carrying out higher-level strategic plans. They answer directly to their kingdom’s rulers and ensure their will is carried out in the field of battle. 

### Eternal Guard
Though all tomb guard legions consider themselves to be “eternal,” this legion takes the expression to the extreme by courting the favor of their death god in exchange for regenerative abilities. This blessed regeneration allows the enteral guard to suffer devastating assaults and rise again to ruthlessly cut down those who thought they could best the elite soldiers of the death god. Such is their tenacity that they don’t bother with using shields for protection and instead duel-wield khopeshes so they may better cut down their comparatively fragile foes.

> Mummy Soldiers
The skeletal soldiers and tomb warriors presented here are assumed to be more skeletal than mummy-like and, as such, have a weakness to bludgeoning damage rather than fire damage. If you wish to flavor these minions as being lesser mummies, you can change their bludgeoning weakness to fire weakness.
