# Tomb Kingdom Infantry
Deep within ancient tombs and buried under sandy dunes lie forgotten legions whose loyalty to their bygone kingdoms and undying lords transcends death. These soldiers swore to continue their service into the afterlife and died with their weapons and armor in hand to ensure they would always be ready to answer the call of their eternal lords.

When the undying priests and monarchs of antiquity make war, they summon these regiments of unbreakable undead warriors who tirelessly carry out the orders of their superiors. These skeletal soldiers have forgotten most of their former identities, retaining only their training and their sense of unwavering duty. In battle, they execute the commands of their superiors with flawless devotion, never flinching in the face of danger as they carry out their eternal service.

## Skeletal Infantry
These undead represent the most numerous and lowest-ranking soldiers of the tomb king armies. They were given only the most rudimentary of burial rites, resulting in almost none of their former personality surviving. They possess only the knowledge and skills needed to serve as efficient and loyal soldiers. Though they cannot speak, they can understand and carry out orders with flawless efficiency. Each skeletal regiment retains the years of training and experience with its weapons and combat role that it had in life, and the long years have not dulled their skills.

> ***Curse of the Netherworld.*** When the skeleton dies, it curses each non-undead creature within 10 feet of it, forcing each of those creatures to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail) or be cursed for 1 minute. A creature cursed this way has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws, has the skeleton's Etherealness bonus action, has the skeleton's Ethereal Sight trait, and gains a fly speed of 15 ft. with the ability to hover.
>
>  As an action, a cursed creature can repeat the saving throw to attempt to end the curse. If a creature would return to Material Plane in a space occupied by a solid object or creature, it is immediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that it can occupy and takes force damage equal to twice the number of feet it is moved.   
>
> ***Ethereal Sight.*** The skeleton can see 60 ft. into the Ethereal Plane when it is on the Material Plane, and vice versa.
>
> ***Incorporeal Movement.*** The skeleton can move through other creatures and objects as if they are difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.***  The skeleton makes two spectral khopesh attacks. If both attacks hit the same creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or drop an object of the skeleton's choice. The object lands at the creature's feet, and if the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 8), the skeleton can have the object flung up to 10 feet away from the creature in the direction of the skeleton's choice. The skeleton can choose for the flung item to enter the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. The item returns to the plane it was shunted from after 1 minute.
>
> ***Spectral Khopesh.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:*  16 (4d6 + 2) force damage.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Etherealness.*** The skeleton enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or vice versa. It is visible on the Material Plane while it is in the Border Ethereal, and vice versa, yet it can't affect or be affected by anything on the other plane.
>




> ##### Option Rules: Binding Curses or Longer lasting Curses
>If you're running an adventure where your players turning ethereal and being able to move through objects would be problematic, you can modify the curse so that creatures under its effects can't move, be moved, or be teleported more than 30 feet away from where the skeleton that cursed them died. On the flip side, if you want to make the curse a key part of how players explore an adventure location, you can extend its duration.
