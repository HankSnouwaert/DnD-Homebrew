## Tomb Knights



> ### Just beneath the surface
>Here are a few things to consider when running the encounter with burrowing creatures
>a few things to consider well running creatures that have a borough speed, attacks within reach greater then five feet can not pierce through the solid surface of the ground. Generally a burrowing creature should be within 5 feet of a creature it's about to attack if it's underground. Creatures to make opportunity attacks if a creature boroughs beneath the ground leaving its attack range. Additionally creatures mounted on a burrowing creature are dismounted if the creature decides borough more than 5 feet beneath the surface. As long as it is within 5 feet of the surface, the creature moves along the surface but the amount cannot be seen.

### Tomb Knight Tactics
#### Necroserpents

Necroserpents are ambush creatures that either pretend to be inanimate statues or hide beneath the sand, waiting for prey to pass by. In sandy environments, they will wait 25 feet beneath the sand and emerge 10 feet away from their intended victim. They attack with a bite and tail attack, then dive 25 feet below the surface again before repeating the process on their next turn.

Necroserpents act as skirmishers, attempting to poison as many targets as possible. They always leverage their reach and burrow speed to stay out of melee reach from their targets. They will also use their tails to push back any creature that could potentially make an attack of opportunity against them as they retreat underground.

#### Tomb Knights
These warriors serve as elite cavalry for the Tomb Kingdoms and focus on charging into the vulnerable flanks of foes. Their Mount Bound ability and Redirect reaction work well together as the knight can redirect attacks to itself if it is at 0 hit points. However, if the mount has been reduced to zero hit points and the knight still has the majority of its hit points, it will not use this reaction.

When they're riding necroserpents, you can utilize their steed's pushing tail attacks to set up effective lance attacks from the knight.

##### Venom Knights
Using the same tactics as Tomb Knights, a Venom Knight should always have a mount capable of poisoning targets. Necroserpents are ideal, as, along with their poison, their tail attack can push targets away, ensuring the knight's lance does not gain disadvantage.

These elite variants use most of the same tactics as typical tomb knights. They should always have mounts capable of poisoning enemies. Necroserpents are ideal for this as they can poison foes and push them away, ensuring the knight's lance attacks can be used optimally.

### Tomb Knight Loot
The valuable items looted from necroserpents will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the tomb knights comes in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Knight Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
