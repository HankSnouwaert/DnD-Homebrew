## Tomb Knights & Necroserpents
In the sunbaked deserts and ancient necropolises of the Tomb Kingdoms, the tomb knights stand as a symbol of undying strength and loyalty. These elite warriors, once the most formidable in life, continue to serve in death, mounted upon their fearsome steeds - the necroserpents.

**Formidable Steeds.** The necroserpents are a sight to behold, colossal serpentine statues crafted from stone and metal, their forms echoing the deadly desert cobras of the dunes. Towering over the sands, these constructs possess an otherworldly grace in their movement, their bodies adorned with intricate hieroglyphs and sacred symbols. Their fangs, as long as scimitars, are not just for show – they drip with potent venom, a mimicry of the lethal toxins found in the desert serpents they resemble.

**Masters of Ambush.** The necroserpents are not merely fearsome in appearance but are also formidable in battle strategy. Their design allows them to burrow through the desert sands, moving unseen before bursting forth in a terrifying ambush. This ability makes them unpredictable and deadly, capable of turning the tide of battle by striking unexpectedly from below.

**Bonded in Death.** Each tomb knight was once a veteran soldier who, after years of brutal combat, began to show signs of uncontrolled bloodlust of other forms of mental instability. Rather than face the shame of dismissal, they voluntarily committed ritual suicide using the excruciating venom of a necroserpant so that they could serve in the eternal afterlife as tomb knights. These warriors were each buried alongside a necroserpent statue. 

Upon awakening from their deathly slumber, the spirit of the tomb knight infuses the statue, bringing the necroserpent to life. This mystical bond allows them to fight as one, with the tomb knight riding atop his serpentine steed, wielding ancient weapons and tactics long forgotten by modern civilizations.

**Unified Existence.** The tomb knight and his necroserpent are bound by more than just loyalty; they share a single spirit. This unique connection means that to vanquish them, one must destroy both knight and steed. As long as one remains, the other can continue to fight, driven by the undying will that animates them.

#### Venom Knights
In the realm of the tomb kingdoms, the greatest power belongs to those who carry the greatest blessings of their gods, allowing warriors to intertwine their martial powers with ancient and divine magic. The venom knights stand as a testament to this combination of divine favor and lethal skill. These elite tomb knights, once formidable in their own right, received a dark blessing from the serpent goddess of their pantheon. Her gift transformed them into harbingers of venomous destruction. Clad in armor adorned with serpentine designs and wielding enchanted blades dripping with deadly toxins, they strike fear into the hearts of their foes. The venom that coats their weapons is a manifestation of their goddess’s power, crippling and weakening even the strongest adversaries with terrifying efficiency.

What sets the venom knights apart is their uncanny ability to exploit the vulnerabilities of those afflicted by poison. With each precise strike, they demonstrate an almost supernatural understanding of how to maximize the agony and effectiveness of their venomous assault. In battle, they are silent and deadly hunters, their presence often unnoticed until it's too late, and their enemies lay incapacitated by their toxic blades. The existence of the venom knights serves as a chilling reminder of the Tomb Kingdoms' mastery over death and poison, making them a feared force across the desolate landscapes they haunt.

> <br> &#8226; Creatures mounted on a burrowing creature are dismounted if the creature decides to burrow more than 5 feet beneath the surface. As long as it is within 5 feet of the surface, the creature moves along the surface, but the mount cannot be seen.

### Tomb Knight Tactics
#### Necroserpents

Necroserpents are ambush creatures that either pretend to be inanimate statues or hide beneath the sand, waiting for prey to pass by. In sandy environments, they will wait 25 feet beneath the sand and emerge 10 feet away from their intended victim. They attack with a bite and tail attack, then dive 25 feet below the surface again before repeating the process on their next turn.

Necroserpents act as skirmishers, attempting to poison as many targets as possible. They always leverage their reach and burrow speed to stay out of melee reach from their targets. They will also use their tails to push back any creature that could potentially make an attack of opportunity against them as they retreat underground.

#### Tomb Knights
These warriors serve as elite cavalry for the Tomb Kingdoms and focus on charging into the vulnerable flanks of foes. Their Mount Bound ability and Redirect reaction work well together as the knight can redirect attacks to itself if it is at 0 hit points. However, if the mount has been reduced to zero hit points and the knight still has the majority of its hit points, it will not use this reaction.

When they're riding necroserpents, you can utilize their steed's pushing tail attacks to set up effective lance attacks from the knight.

##### Venom Knights
Using the same tactics as Tomb Knights, a Venom Knight should always have a mount capable of poisoning targets. Necroserpents are ideal, as, along with their poison, their tail attack can push targets away, ensuring the knight's lance does not gain disadvantage.

These elite variants use most of the same tactics as typical tomb knights. They should always have mounts capable of poisoning enemies. Necroserpents are ideal for this as they can poison foes and push them away, ensuring the knight's lance attacks can be used optimally.

### Tomb Knight Loot
The valuable items looted from necroserpents will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the tomb knights comes in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Tomb Knight Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
