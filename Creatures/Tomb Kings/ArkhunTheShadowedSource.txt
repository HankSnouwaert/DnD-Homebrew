## Arkhun, The Shadowed
*Dread Lich & Eternal Servant of Death*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Underdark; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual <br>

If you're seeking to enter the desert of the ancient Kings. In the days when the sun did burn fierce upon the vast desert, where the Ancient Kings of old held sway, there came a warning to all who would venture into that prodigious waste: be thou Fool or be thou Brave, for the sands of that desolate realm spare none. Few who tread its boundless expanse, seeking riches or lore, return to tell of it, and fewer still would dare its perils again, though offered gold equal to their own weight. The sun’s cruel fire, the wind’s bitter sting, and the dancing mirages that mock the eye do lead the frail of heart to wander unto their doom.

And lo, should thine eyes behold the vast temples and pyramids that rise like mountains against the sky, turn back, for at their feet lie cities forsaken by the living. Within those silent walls, legions of tireless shades keep eternal vigil, guarding the wondrous monuments raised by their masters, who sleep in mighty tombs wrought in the days of their dynasty’s glory. To draw near is to court death, for these sentinels suffer no pilferer to disturb their sacred charge.

Yet of all the perils that haunt the desert’s heart, one dread shadow looms darker than all: a black tower that stands amidst the dunes, appearing as a mirage born of night. Flee whilst thou hast the chance, for within that ebon spire dwells Arkhun the Shadowed, a wizard of the blackest mind. Once a man, in the time when life flourished in the desert and the kingdoms stood at their zenith, Arkhun was of the lesser nobility. But ambition, that cruel tempter, led him to pledge himself to a necromancer whose name I dare not utter, a man whose lust for power sought to cast down the high lords and raise himself as a god, with all the world bowed before him in undeath.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Arkhun, sworn to this dark master, wrought deeds unspeakable and rituals blasphemous, securing his place as the necromancer’s greatest servant and disciple. Leading legions of unholy things, he carved a path of ruin across the lands, consuming all who stood against him. Yet the kingdoms of the desert, in their final hour, united their might and struck him down. A blade pierced his wicked heart, and with his dying breath, Arkhun spat a curse upon any who would disturb his remains. As the ebon flames consumed his flesh, leaving naught but charred bones, the generals who felled him quaked in terror. Fearing his curse, they dared not touch his remains, but ordered their legions to entomb them beneath a mountain of stone.

Soon after, the great necromancer himself was slain, but not before he cursed the land and its proud empires. Now their ruins and their dead litter the desert, silent witnesses to the fall of dynasties. Yet true evil, as the gods know, never perishes wholly. It is whispered that Arkhun has broken free of his stone prison and raised a black tower that shifts like a shadow across the waste. From this dark stronghold, he commands fell creations that patrol the sands without rest. Upon a sable chariot he rides forth, pulled by a myriad of beasts risen from the grave, seeking the relics of his master’s power, chief among them the Nine Books of the Dead. Within their accursed pages lie the rituals and spells devised by the necromancer in his pursuit of godhood. These tomes, Unable to be destroyed, were hidden at the farthest reaches of the world, and it is said that should Arkhun claim them all, he will summon his master from the hell to which he was banished.

O wanderer, know this: if such a day should come, only the Dead Kings, whose hatred for the necromancer burns brighter than the desert sun, may stand as our final hope against the darkness that would consume all.

#### Altars of Death
If Arkhun is fighting in his lair, you can increase the encounter’s challenge by granting him access to Altars of Death to aid his Ritual of the Dead trait. Each altar is a large magical object with AC 18, 75 hit points, and immunity to Necrotic and Poison damage. You can place one or more altars throughout the lair, with each altar increasing Arkhun’s Challenge Rating by 1.

On Initiative Count 1, for each active altar in Arkhun’s lair at the start of his turn, his Ritual of the Dead gains power as follows:

* **First Round of Combat:** The Ritual gains 1 power per altar.
* **Second Round of Combat:** The Ritual gains 3 power per altar.
* **Any Round Thereafter:** The Ritual gains 5 power per altar.

A creature within 5 feet of an altar can use its action to make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The outcomes are as follows:

* **Failure:** Nothing happens.
* **Failure by 5 or More:** The creature inadvertently aids Arkhun, and the Ritual gains 5 power.
* **Success:** The altar is destroyed.
* **Success by 5 or More:** The creature channels some of the altar’s power. The next spell of 1st level or higher that the creature casts before the end of its next turn has its effective level increased by 1.

#### Regional Effects
The region surrounding Arkhun's lair is warped by his presence, creating one or more of the following effects:

* Any corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid that remains within 1 mile of Arkhun's lair for more than 1 hour has its flesh burned away, rising as a **skeleton** under Arkhun's control.

* Whenever a creature casts a necromancy spell of 1st level or higher within 1 mile of the lair, the spell’s effective level increases by 1. Additionally, Arkhun can attempt to probe the creature’s mind. The target must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, Arkhun can see what the creature sees for the next minute and discern its reasoning, emotions, and something prominent in its mind (such as a worry, love, or hate). On a successful save, nothing happens. Either way, the target knows Arkhun attempted to probe its mind. A creature can only be affected this way once per hour.

#### Epic Battle: The Shadowed Charioteer
If you wish to make The Arkhun into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, may have him ride atop his **shadowed chariot** being pulled by 4 **warhorses of the shadowed chariot**. All together, they have a CR of 25.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Befalling Curse.*** Whenever a creature deals damage to Arkhun while he is Bloodied (170 hit points or fewer), he can curse the target. While Cursed, the target can’t regain hit points and takes 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns. The target can use its action to make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
>
> ***Ritual of the Dead.*** Whenever Arkhun rolls initiative, he can start a ritual that lasts until combat ends or he dies. This ritual gains Ritual Power from his abilities. At the following power thresholds, up to 4 undead of the specified type appear in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of Arkhun and remain until destroyed or Arkhun dies. Summoned undead act on initiative count 24: <bR> **20** - Desert Ghoul <bR> **40** - Vile Hound <bR> **60** - Tomb Bat <bR> **80** - Dune Specter <bR> **100** - Warhorse of the Shadowed Chariot
>
> ***Tome of the Dead.*** Arkhun carries a magic tome with AC 10 and immunity to Necrotic, Poison, and Psychic damage. While holding or carrying the tome, Arkhun gains 10 Ritual Power at the start of each of his turns. The tome can't be destroyed, but if it takes 35 or more damage in a single turn, it becomes inactive until the end of Arkhun’s next turn.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Tomb Blade.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target (NOTE: What's the range?). *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) Slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) Necrotic damage, and the target must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 20. 
>
> *Failure:* The target’s soul is extracted, leaving the body unconscious in a state of suspended animation for 1 minute, after which the body dies. The soul is trapped in arkhun’s tome blade until arkhun dies, becomes Incapacitated, takes 50 or more damage in a single turn, or a Dispel Good and Evil spell is cast on the target, returning the soul to the body. While the soul is trapped, Arkhun gains 5 Ritual Power at the start of each of his turns.
>

> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Arkhun gains three additional actions in combat: Siphon Fate, Siphon Pain, and Siphon Fear. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count (losing ties), separate from arkhun’s own, if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace any action with Dispel Magic or Tenacious Will, and he can use Tenacious Will even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Siphon Fate (Initiative Count 20).*** Arkhun casts *impending doom** using Intelligence as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20). The spell does not require concentration, does not allow a repeat saving throw, and lasts until initiative count 15 of the next round. If the creature fails a saving throw while under the effects of the spell, Arkhun gains 5 Ritual Power. Arkhun can’t target the same creature with this spell on consecutive rounds.
>
> ***Siphon Pain (Initiative Count 15).*** Arkhun casts *crippling pain** using Intelligence as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20). The effects last until initiative count 15 of the next round.

Arkhun can’t target the same creature with this spell on consecutive rounds.
>
> ***Siphon Fear (Initiative Count 5).*** Arkhun casts *aspect of dread** using Intelligence as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20). If a creature Frightened by this spell is hit by an attack from the source of its fear, Arkhun gains 5 Ritual Power. Arkhun can’t target the same creature with this spell on consecutive rounds.
>
> ***Dispel Magic.*** Arkhun casts *dispel magic* using Intelligence as his spellcasting ability. (NOTE: At what level?)
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Arkhun is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

### Arkhun's Strategy

Arkhun employs a defensive battle of attrition, leveraging his Ritual of the Dead to summon undead minions (Desert Ghoul, Vile Hound, Tomb Bat, Dune Specter, Warhorse of the Shadowed Chariot) as combat progresses. He prioritizes survival over high-risk attacks, maintaining distance from enemies (>30 ft.) to avoid counterattacks and using his Shadowed Chariot when available to enhance mobility and defense.

#### Arkhun’s Actions

* **Normal Turn:** Arkhun prefers Tome Blade against targets with low Charisma or those affected by *impending doom*, as it traps souls and grants 5 Ritual Power per turn. If Tome Blade risks exposure to melee counterattacks, he uses Death Lance (150 ft. range) for safer Necrotic damage. He ends his turn more than 30 feet from enemies, using *misty step* to avoid opportunity attacks.
* **Siphon Fate (Initiative Count 20):** Arkhun casts *impending doom* on a creature with low Charisma not already under a debilitating effect, making it his primary target for attacks to trigger additional saving throws and gain 5 Ritual Power per failed save.
* **Siphon Pain (Initiative Count 15):** Arkhun casts *crippling pain* on opponents reliant on bonus actions (e.g., rogues, monks) or melee fighters who must close distance to attack him. He gains 1 Ritual Power per damage instance, or 2 if the target fails the save.
* **Siphon Fear (Initiative Count 5):** Arkhun casts *aspect of dread* on a minion surrounded by multiple opponents, prioritizing groups with low Wisdom or a creature affected by *impending doom*. If a frightened creature is hit by the source of its fear, Arkhun gains 5 Ritual Power.
* **Fallback Actions:** Arkhun uses Dispel Magic to counter magical effects hindering him or his chariot

#### Shadowed Chariot Tactics
* **Damage Redirection:** Arkhun redirects all damage he would take to a steed, per Shadowed Charioteer.
* **Steed Replacement:** If a steed is destroyed, Arkhun summons a new one (via Ritual of the Dead) to fill the chariot's now vacant steed slot using its Shadowed Charioteer trait.
* **Mobility:** If the chariot is immobilized (e.g., by magical effects), Arkhun prioritizes Dispel Magic to restore movement. If ineffective, he uses *misty step* to reposition until the chariot can move again.
* **Defensive Positioning:** Arkhun keeps the chariot mobile, charging in and out of combat to maintain distance (>30 ft.) from enemies.

#### Minion Tactics
Arkhun spreads his summoned minions to avoid area-of-effect spells unless they are steeds for the Shadowed Chariot. He assigns one minion to focus on the creature affected by *impending doom* to maximize saving throw failures. Specific minion tactics are:
* **Desert Ghoul:** Summoned near targets with low Constitution to exploit their Claws attack, which inflicts paralysis.
* **Vile Hound:** Summoned in pairs to leverage Pack Tactics, targeting creatures affected by *crippling pain*, as standing up triggers additional damage from the spell.
* **Tomb Bat:** Summoned high in the air to dive-bomb targets that are alone to gain advantage via Menace, or attack those affected by *impending doom*.
* **Dune Specter:** The deadliest minions, summoned to target creatures affected by *crippling pain*, forcing movement and action.
* **Warhorse of the Shadowed Chariot:** Used as steeds for Shadowed Charge, they are the weakest minions and completely expendable.

##### Arkhun, The Shadowed Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **A New Realm of Death.** Seeking to expand his realm of death, Arkhun teleports his tower to the middle of a populated city to perform a ritual that will drain it and the surrounding lands of all life. |
|  2  |**The Necromancer's Relic.** The players come across a dark artifact Arkhun needs to revivify his dark master, and soon find themselves hunted by his minions. |
|  3  |**Eternal Enemies.** Tomb pharaohs with an ancient grudge against Arkhun recruit the players to infiltrate his lair while they make war against the bulk of his forces elsewhere. |
|  4  | **League of the Damned.** Arkhun is assembling an undead alliance of his master's former servants, and the players must sabotage it by pitting them against each other or slaying them before they can join Arkhun.| 

### Arkhun, The Shadowed Queen Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from Arkhun come in the form of relics and religious icons he carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.




#### Arkhun, The Shadowed Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you're running the epic Form of the Asp version of Khalindra's battle, use the Form of the Asp Loot Table instead of the normal Khalindra loot table.

___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock, Wizard

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
