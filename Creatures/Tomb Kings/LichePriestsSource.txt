## Liche-Priests

In the heart of the vast desert, where timeless pyramids touch the sky and ancient secrets lay buried beneath golden sands, the liche priests stand as the eternal custodians of the Tomb Kingdoms. Theirs is the lore of life, death, and the shadowy realm that lies between.

***Spiritual Stewards.*** Liche priests were not merely mages or scholars; they were the religious leaders of the Tomb Kingdoms. Entrusted with the divine responsibility of ensuring their pharaohs and royalty achieved immortality, these priests were the masterminds behind the intricate preservation of both the rulers and their vast armies. They mummified bodies, sealed tombs with arcane runes, and ensured that even in death, the grandeur of their kingdom persisted.

***Eternal Vigil.*** The liche priests were tasked with discovering the ultimate mystery: transcending death itself. Through their relentless search for arcane knowledge, they found a way to trap their souls within their withering bodies, thus escaping death's final embrace. This, however, became both their greatest achievement and curse. Over the ages, their once-robust forms have withered into skeletal husks. Their skin is stretched tight over bone, and their eyes, once full of vigor, now glow with an eerie, unending light.

***Awakeners of the Dead.*** The vast silent legions of the Tomb Kingdoms can be roused to life via the incantations of the liche priests. Using ancient rituals, they learned to call back the spirits of their royalty, imbuing mummified corpses with new unlife. Likewise, they can awaken entire preserved armies, ready to march and fight once again under the banners of their eternal kingdom.

***Divine Arcanists.*** Every spell, every invocation, and every ritual the liche priests perform is a homage to their deities. They believe their power flows directly from the gods they worship. Their magic, diverse and potent, is recorded meticulously in ancient tomes, books, and scrolls of papyrus. These texts are treasures in their own right, containing secrets that have shaped the destiny of the Tomb Kingdoms.

***Hierarchy of Eternity.*** Among the liche priests, rank and structure are paramount. From the lowliest acolyte studying the first mysteries of death to the high priests who hold secrets as old as the sands themselves, there is a clear hierarchy. When these eternal priests congregate, their combined power, channeled through sacred rituals, can alter the very fabric of reality, making them a formidable force in both the realms of magic and governance.

### Optional Rule: Hieratic Hierarchy

When several Tomb Kingdom priests collaborate in their usage of magic, they can combine their powers to form an arcane hierarchy that allows them to support each others' abilities.

A hierarchy consists of at least two spell casters in service to the Tomb Kingdoms. Any of the creatures in this document can be members of a hierarchy. The Challenge Rating (CR) of members of a hierarchy should be increased by 1.

Members of a hierarchy gain the following benefits:

* Upon rolling initiative, members of a hierarchy can swap their initiative orders with each other in any order they agree upon.

* When a member of the hierarchy casts a spell requiring concentration, it can choose another willing member who isn't already concentrating on a spell to maintain concentration on the spell in its place. Moreover, if a member dies while concentrating on a spell, another member can choose to maintain concentration of the spell for its remaining duration.

* All members gain a +1 bonus to saving throws made to maintain concentration on spells for each hierarchy member within 60 feet.

### Liche Priest Adventures
The following table provides some ways to create adventures featuring these undying lore keepers in your games:

##### Tomb Carrion Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The God-Pharaoh's Return:** The liche priests are working on a ritual to reincarnate a long-dead God-Pharaoh, a ruler so powerful that his reign would spell doom for the living world. The adventurers must find and destroy the artifacts that power this ritual.|
|  2  | **The Last Acolyte:** Rumors speak of a last living acolyte of a liche priest, carrying secrets that could either bolster the Tomb Kingdoms or bring about their final demise. Both protectors and hunters of this acolyte seek the party's assistance.|
|  3  |**Deserted Village:** A village near the Tomb Kingdoms has been mysteriously abandoned overnight. Tracks lead to an underground crypt where a liche priest is rumored to have been experimenting with new forms of magic. |
|  4  | **The Soul Harvest:** A liche priest has devised a dark ritual that drains the souls of the living to rejuvenate his desiccated form. Villages nearby are reporting their people falling into soulless comas. The adventurers must stop the ritual and confront the priest before an entire city becomes his next target. |
|  5  | **Keepers of the Forbidden Library**: An ancient library containing forbidden knowledge is protected by the liche priests. When an explorer manages to steal a tome and is subsequently cursed, the adventurers are hired to infiltrate the library, return the book, and break the curse.  |
|  6  | **The Stolen Sun:** A liche priest, envious of the living world, has captured a fragment of the sun, plunging the region into eternal night and cold. The adventurers must traverse the treacherous, darkened desert to reclaim the sun fragment and restore daylight.|

### Liche Priest Tactics
These powerful spellcasters specialize in enhancing their undead minions. They possess a range of spells, and different rankings of priests have different power levels.

Instead of detailing every rank of liche, these tactics focus on the spells they can access and how to use them most effectively. The more spells the liche has access to, the more urgently they should be cast, typically starting with the most potent. Liches can wisely identify party members with weak proficiencies and saving throws and use that to determine who to target with what spells.

#### Lore of Death 
Death liches prioritize dealing damage and will sacrifice minions to empower themselves. They reserve their stronger spells for later stages of combat when enemies are more likely to fail their saves, thanks to their Life Leech trait.

**Crippling Pain:** Target skirmishers like rogues or monks to hinder their combat effectiveness.

**Spirit Leech:** Use when a target with low Charisma is within range or when the liche's health drops below half.

**Impending Doom:** Target martial characters with multiple attacks and low Charisma.

**Horrifying Laughter or Wind of Death:**  Use *horrifying laughter* to target martial characters with low Wisdom scores. Switch to *wind of death* when its saving throw has been boosted by at least +1 or if it can affect four or more targets, as it synergizes well with the Life Leech trait.

**Aspect of Dread:** This is a strong opening spell, forcing multiple targets to make saving throws and fueling the liche's Life Leech trait. It can also be cast on an enemy to frighten its allies or serve as an escape tool when the liche is surrounded.

#### Lore of Liche-Priests

Liches with this lore rely heavily on their minions for maximum potential, with at least three minions being essential for full efficiency.

**Guiding Wind:** This spell can be used to move a large group of undead into melee combat, or help ranged archers escape from combat. It can also serve as an escape for the liche if it's in melee combat. However, be cautious with the positioning of the spell; enemies within the spell's radius can opt to be moved by it as well.

**Incantation of Protection or Incantation of Zeal:** Prioritize *incantation of zeal* over *incantation of protection* unless enemies are using bludgeoning weapons against skeletons or over half the party consists of martial classes wielding weapons that deal physical damage. In such cases, prioritize *incantation of protection*.

**Black Tentacles or Decrepify:** Cast *black tentacles* when three or more targets are available, or if two targets engage with minions. Be wary; skeletons affected by this spell will incur double damage. If targets are dispersed, use *decrepify*—preferably a martial character with a weak Constitution saving throw.

**Skull Storm:** Use *skull storm* once it can affect three targets. If it can hit two targets, prioritize the spell's bonus action over the liche's Dredge ability. The liche might opt to move alongside the spell to shield itself from ranged attacks. The Liche will cease concentration on this spell if the initial storm has moved beyond outside the field of battle or if the spell's bonus action can't affect two or more targets.

#### Lore of Light 
Light liches rely on grouping up their enemies and allies alike to maximize their potency.

**Warding Light:** Cast this as a bonus action when the liche's main action is occupied with something else, such as executing a Disengage maneuver.

**Burning Gaze:** This spell is ideal when it can hit four or more creatures, be they allies or adversaries. If foes are scattered, concentrate *burning gaze* on a single enemy to impose a disadvantage on its saving throw. 

**Dazzling Light & Sunbeam:** These spells are best used when they can affect four or more creatures, whether enemies or allies.

**Flame Strike & Net of Light Combo:** *Flame strike* becomes more lethal when combined with *net of light*. Initiate with *net of light* so that targets caught by it suffer disadvantage on their saves against *flame strike*. Abandon concentration on *net of light* once only two or fewer creatures are trapped within it, especially if the liche has an optimal opportunity to cast *sunbeam*.

#### Lore of Shadow
Shadow liches use debilitating and enhancing spells and utilize their Shadow Paths trait for optimal positioning.

**Shroud of Dusk:** Use this spell against adversaries in melee combat with the liche, then have the liche swap positions with a minion to distance itself from the threat.

**Unseen Lurker:** This should ideally be cast on the liche's most formidable martial minion, then used to swap places with the minion to position it advantageously.

**Withering Resolve:** Target the enemy with the weakest Wisdom save to cripple its capabilities.

**Penumbral Pendulum:** Activate when two or more targets with low Intelligence and Dexterity saves can be caught in its path. If three or more targets are available, cast it, even if they have high Intelligence and Dexterity saves.




\columnbreak

**Mindrazors or Pit of Shadows:** Which of these two spells the liche uses depends on whether it can target two or more enemies with *pit of shadows*, specifically those with low Dexterity saves. If this is not feasible, use *mindrazors*. Abandon concentration on *mindrazors* if an opportunity arises to use *pit of shadows* on two or more targets later.

#### Hieratic Hierarchy
When liches come together to form a hierarchy, they can execute devastating combos by pooling their concentration with junior members, enabling them to channel spells they wouldn't normally use together. Potential combinations are vast, but here are a few notable ones:

**Net of Light & Sunbeam:** This combination can wreak havoc. A hierarchy member capable of casting *net of light* should initiate the sequence, regardless of its power. This should then be followed by the most powerful liche using sunbeam on the trapped creatures.

**Decrepify, Black Tentacles & Skull Storms:** Use *decrepify* to nearly guarantee that targets fail their saving throws against the subsequent *black tentacles* and *skull storm*.

**Impending Doom with Other Casters:** *Impending doom* becomes particularly potent when combined with other spellcasters. Cast it quickly, as it enhances the potency of all the liches' magic, whose spells typically have a low baseline save DCs.

**Withering Resolve & Powerful Spells:** The potency of *withering resolve* is magnified when channeled by multiple casters. Let the more junior members of the hierarchy who can cast it take the lead. Then, the most formidable among them should follow up with a mighty spell such as *penumbral pendulum* or *pit of shadows*.

### Liche Priest Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from liche priests come in the form of relics and religious icons they carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Liche Priest Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Lore of Death

This brand of magic plays on the nature of mortality and fragility of life, though it is strictly distinct from traditional necromancy, as it embraces the inevitability of death rather than attempting to deny it. Its users can manipulate negative energy, sap the vitality of foes, and instill mortal terror in those around them. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Death often wield.

#### Aspect of Dread
*2nd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A white feather)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Crippling Pain
*3rd-level necromancy*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Wizard, Warlock

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Horrifying Laughter
*6th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Wizard
___

You target a creature you can see within range, causing it to collapse into debilitating fits of deranged laughter. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less aren't affected.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration, any creature within 30 feet of the laughing creature that can hear the laughter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the laughing creature until the end of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it stabilizes but remains laughing and can no longer attempt saving throws against the spell. If the spell ends while the creature has 0 hit points, it dies.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black feather)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

####  Purple Sun
*9th-level transmutation*

- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of lime, water, and earth)

You conjure a grim sphere of purple light at a point you designate within range. The sphere has a maximum radius of 60 feet and illuminates its area with dim light.

Any creature that either enters the sphere's area for the first time on its turn or begins its turn inside the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified for the duration. At the end of <br> each of its turns, the target can make another <br> Constitution saving throw. On a success, the <br> spell ends on the target. However, if a creature <br> accumulates three failed saves against this <br> spell (including the initial failed save), it <br> remains petrified indefinitely until the <br> condition is cured by other means.

If a petrified creature is physically <br> damaged or broken during this state, it <br> will manifest the same damage upon <br> being reverted to its original form.

## Lore of <Br> Liche-Priests
This ancient lore of magic was <br> developed by the liche-priests of <br> the long-gone Tomb Kingdom <br> empire. The undying liche-priests <br> are still its primary practitioners, but <br> the secrets of this lore have slipped out <br> into the hands of other desert peoples <br> and arcane archeologists. Its magic <br> focuses on incantations designed to bolster <br> the effectiveness of soldiers, magic that <br> harnesses the power of the desert, and curses <br> that conjure the underworld spirits and punish <br> trespassers. The following spells are examples <br> of the types of magic users of the Lore of <br> Liche-Preists often wield.

#### Cursed Blades
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You imbue a weapon within range with the essence of death. When this weapon hits a creature, the target becomes cursed for the spell's duration. At the start of your turn, each creature cursed this way within 90 feet of you takes 1d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional weapon for each slot level above 1st. Using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher increases the damage by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.

#### Decrepify

- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A handful of shriveled weeds)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You attempt to drain the vitality of a creature within range, leaving it feeble and vulnerable. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and its Strength and Dexterity scores reduced to 1. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Constitution saving throw, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration becomes 24 hours and the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a short or long rest. If you use an 8th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled and no longer requires Concentration; the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a long rest.

\columnbreak



Any creature the storm moves into, or that ends its turn within the storm, must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct a cluster of skulls from the storm to streak toward a point you can see within 30 feet of the sphere. Once the skulls reach their destination or hit a solid surface, they lash out, biting at everything nearby. Every creature within 5 feet of where they stopped must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The skulls then return to the storm.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, damage dealt by the storm and the skull clusters increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

## Lore of Light
This magic taps into the power of light and its <br> many aspects. Its users not only conjure literal <br> light but can ignite the light in the souls of others, <br> healing or inspiring them. Some magic from this lore <br> even blesses creatures with the ability to move at light <br> speed. The following spells are examples of the types of magic users of the Lore of Light often wield.

#### Burning Gaze
*1st-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

You fixate on two points within the spell's range, no more than 10 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of searing light erupt from your eyes, blazing between the two points. Any creature intersected by the path of the beams must make a Dexterity saving throw. Creatures take 1d4 fire damage and 1d4 radiant damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. If the two points are at the same location, any creature at that point has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d4, the radiant damage increases by 1d4, the spell's range increases by 10 feet, and the maximum distance between the two points increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Dazzling Light
*3rd-level evocation*

 Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes blinded until the end of your next turn.

#### Holy Nova
*4th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

A burst of divine light emanates from you, enveloping all creatures within 30 feet. Each creature in this area must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 3d6 + your Wisdom modifier radiant damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

#### Mass Haste
*8th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (a shaving of licorice root)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

Choose up to six willing creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, each chosen creature has its speed doubled, gains a +2 bonus to AC, has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and is quickened.


#### Net of Light
*4th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (A white thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.



\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Should a creature inside the web attempt to use teleportation or interplanar travel to escape, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. A successful save allows the creature to utilize its spell or ability to exit the web, while a failure causes the spell or ability to be expended without effect. Notably, this net of light also extends into the Ethereal Plane, preventing ethereal escape.

A restrained creature can take an action on its turn to attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending its restrained condition on a success.

#### Warding Light
*1st level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M, (sliver coin)
- **Duration:**  1 round.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin
___

You envelop a creature of your choice within range in a protective radiant light. Until the start of your next turn, the creature illuminates bright light out to a 10-foot radius and dim light out an additional 10 feet. During this time, attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage. This effect doesn't hinder attackers who don't depend on sight, such as those with blindsight or those who cannot be blinded.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 1st. The chosen creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

## Lore of Shadow
This magic specializes in trickery, illusion, <br> and twisting the minds of its targets. Its <br> users primarily rely on illusory magic, though <br> they also wield spells that manipulate shadows <br> and even the nature of space and time as others <br> are able to perceive it, constantly leaving their <br> foes seconding guessing what they're seeing. <br> The following spells are examples of the types <br> of magic users of the Lore of Shadow often wield.

- **Range:** 10 feet

***At Higher Levels.*** This spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

#### Mindrazors

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Warlock, Bard
___

You envelop up to three weapons you can see within <Br> range in phantasmal shadows, allowing them to slice <Br> through the minds of their targets. For the duration, <Br> when a creature is hit by an attack from one of these <Br> infused weapons, it takes an additional 1d12 psychic damage.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

#### Mirror Dance
*2nd-level conjuration*

#### Mystifying Miasma

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Ranger, Bard
___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 


 This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.
