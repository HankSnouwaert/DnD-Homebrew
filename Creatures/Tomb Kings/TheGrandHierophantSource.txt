## The Grand Hierophant

In the dim mists of antiquity, when the Tomb Kingdoms still brimmed with life, there arose a sage of unparalleled prowess, known today as the Grand Hierophant. As time withered ancient stones, his name grew synonymous with the enigmatic might of the Tomb Kingdoms.

The Grand Hierophant was the pioneering beacon amongst the liche priests, the first to decipher the esoteric rites of eternal existence, transcending mortality to ascend into undeath. His physique is a haunting mirage of his former self; a desiccated skeletal form draped in opulent, tattered robes, symbolic of his age and wisdom. An ornate staff, crowned with a shimmering gem, proclaims his exalted station. His eye sockets, though devoid of life, glint with an eerie, otherworldly glow, hinting at the vast knowledge and power trapped within.

However, power often invites hubris. With the fall of the Tomb Kingdoms and their subsequent resurrection, the inability of the liche priests to fully restore their once grand civilization was seen as a grievous failure. The Grand Hierophant, as the paragon of their order, bore the brunt of this blame. Thus, a great irony befell him: the one who had unlocked the secrets of immortality was exiled from the very lands he had once elevated. Sworn to wander the vastness beyond the Tomb Kingdoms, he seeks the elusive remedy that would restore his homeland to its prior living magnificence. Until that day, the deserts are forbidden to him.

Yet exile did not diminish him; if anything, it has given him countless opportunities to expand upon his archaic knowledge and power. As eons passed, the Grand Hierophant has amassed an unmatched reservoir of arcane secrets. He wields not only a repertoire of ancient spells but does so with a mastery far beyond any of his liche priest subordinates. Those who try to combat his magic with their own will quickly be cursed and unable to cast spells as their mouths fill with vile insects. Should the gods choose to favor him, the Grand Hierophant can even surround himself in an obscuring and biting sandstorm, making conventional combat tactics difficult to use against him as well.


The Grand Hierophant is formidable enough on his own, but his true power lies in his command over the legions of the dead. Undead guardians rally to his side, driven by an unwavering loyalty. These minions, guided by his ancient hand, are imbued with enhanced vigor, making them formidable adversaries. While they engage, The Grand Hierophant hurls curses upon his enemies, weakening their resolve and corroding their vitality. 

Many have stood against The Grand Hierophant, and he has outlasted them all. Any who stand in the way of his sacred quest will be cast into the oblivion he has evaded for millennia. And once he has found the secrets he seeks, he will return to his dead, crumbling home and restore it to its former, indomitable heights of power.

\pagebreakNum

### Optional Ability: <br> Wrath of the Desert

The Grand Hierophant is protected by the gods of the desert, who can project their power at his behest. If you give him this ability, increase his CR by 1.     
 
 **Sand Storm (Recharges on a short rest).**
At the start of the round on Initiative count 20, The Grand Hierophant can create a 100-foot tall sandstorm with a 20-foot radius centered at a point within 120 feet of him. This ability can be activated even if The Grand Hierophant is incapacitated or surprised. The storm spreads around corners and lasts for 10 minutes, or until it is dismissed by The Grand Hierophant (no action required) or he dies.

The area within the storm is considered difficult terrain and is heavily obscured for creatures other than The Grand Hierophant. Additionally, ranged weapon attack rolls are made with disadvantage if their path passes through the storm.

On initiative count 20 of subsequent rounds, The Grand Hierophant can move the storm up to 20 feet in any direction. If the storm moves over a creature or if a creature ends its turn within the storm, that creature must make a Strength saving throw (The Grand Hierophant ignores this effect). On a failed save, the creature takes 6d6 slashing damage, is pulled 10 feet toward the storm's center, and if the creature is concentrating on a spell, it makes its concentration saving throw caused by the damage with disadvantage.
 


### Casket of Souls
  
The Grand Hierophant can be attuned to a Casket of Souls (whose mechanics are described below.) While attuned, he gains the following special abilities and is considered a CR 20 creature:
  
* He is immune to damage and cannot be moved or teleported against his will while within 5 feet of the casket.
  
* He can unleash the casket's souls (as described in the casket mechanics below) using a legendary action. The initial target for the souls must be the creature that just took its turn.
  
* He can use a legendary action to teleport the casket and himself to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the casket.

### Casket of Souls Mechanics

The casket of souls is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the casket if it has proficiency in the Religion skill and both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 14 or higher. 

A creature attuned to the casket can perform a minute-long ritual to summon it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat a casket of souls with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

\columnbreak

#### Unleashing the Souls

The creature attuned to the casket of souls and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the tormented souls within, targeting a creature it can see within 300 feet. The souls can then jump to another creature within 15 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 15 feet of that one. A creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per turn. A targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If a creature fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) or if the damage from this ability reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the casket begins extracting the target's soul. This effect ends if the casket is destroyed. The affected creature repeats the saving throw at the start of the casket user's next turn, with disadvantage if it has 0 hit points. On a success, the effect ends. If the creature fails, it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the casket until the casket is destroyed. While a creature's soul is trapped this way, it can't be resurrected.

#### Arcane Conduit

Additionally, creatures within 150 feet of the casket have a -1 penalty to their spell save DC and spell attack rolls. The creature attuned to the casket can choose for a creature to receive a +1 bonus instead. This modifier remains even if the creature attuned to the casket dies.

#### The Casket's Destruction

If the casket of souls is destroyed, the trapped souls are freed and lash out at all nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the casket must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
 
##### The Grand Hierophant Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Lost Manuscript:** Whispers circulate of a manuscript detailing the secrets of The Grand Hierophant's power. Many treasure hunters and arcanists are on its trail. The adventurers are hired to retrieve it but must face traps, rival seekers, and perhaps even the watchful eyes of The Hierophant himself.|
|  2  |**The Cursed Oasis:** A cursed oasis has appeared in the desert, with water that turns living beings into stone. Rumors suggest it's The Grand Hierophant's latest experiment in restoring life to the Tomb Kingdoms. The adventurers must investigate and find a way to reverse the curse.|
|  3  |**The Hierophant's Bargain:** An emissary of The Grand Hierophant approaches the party with a deal. Aid him in retrieving an ancient tome, and in return, they'll be granted a boon of power or knowledge. But can they trust the legendary liche priest? |
|  4  | **The Mirage Fortress:** A fortress appears and disappears within the desert at different times. It's believed The Grand Hierophant uses it as a base for his studies. The adventurers, for their reasons or by hiring, are tasked to infiltrate it and uncover its secrets.| 
 
\pagebreakNum

### The Grand Hierophant Tactics 
The Grand Hierophant represents the pinnacle of liche priest spellcasters. Always accompanied by a minimum of three elite undead warriors, The Grand Hierophant is a tactician who prioritizes his own safety over dealing direct damage. His potent ability to heal and resurrect his fallen soldiers makes him excel in prolonged engagements, often outlasting his enemies.

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word 
This ability is triggered in reaction to spellcasting threats. If any spellcaster manages to negate the curse, they immediately become the primary target for The Grand Hierophant and his minions.

#### The Grand Hierophant's Staff 
The Grand Hierophant strategically shares his concentration with the healthiest minion, ensuring it is not already paralyzed or vulnerable to incoming attacks. Furthermore, The Grand Hierophant can use the staff to concentrate on a variety of spells, each unlocking unique legendary actions. Below is a prioritized list detailing which spells he should cast first to harness their associated legendary actions.

##### Skull Storm
On its initial turn, The Grand Hierophant casts *skull storm*, targeting two or more enemies. After this, he deploys his Gust of Skulls legendary action whenever he can affect two or more targets again.

##### Black Tentacles
If The Grand Hierophant identifies two or more targets with low Dexterity and *skull storm* is no longer available, he will cast *black tentacles*. Once enemies are restrained, he will use his Drag Down legendary action. However, he avoids using this action on players with a high Strength saving throw, like barbarians.

##### Decrepify
This spell is reserved for scenarios where neither allies nor enemies are closely grouped for The Grand Hierophant's Incantation spells. The ideal targets are martial characters with weak Constitution saving throws. Once cast, he will use his Wither legendary action at the earliest opportunity.

\columnbreak

#### Incantation
The Grand Hierophant should cast spells using his Incantation legendary action when he can affect three or more powerful allies, particularly undead with a CR (Challenge Rating) of 3 or higher. However, these spells are of secondary priority if he can target three or more enemies with *black tentacles* or *skull storm*.

##### Specific Incantations and Their Uses:

**Guiding Wind:** 
* This spell should be deployed to swiftly move a large group of undead into melee combat.

* It is useful for allowing ranged archers to disengage from close combat.

* It acts as a potential escape route for The Grand Hierophant when surrounded. 

* Caution is advised, as adversaries within the spell's radius might also choose to be moved by it.

#####
**Incantation of Zeal vs. Incantation of Protection:**

* *Incantation of zeal* should generally be given priority over *incantation of protection*.

* However, if opponents possess bludgeoning weapons and The Grand Hierophant has skeletons under his command, or if a significant portion of the enemy group consists of martial classes using physical weaponry, then *incantation of protection* should be prioritized.

#### Tomb Strike Legendary Action
This action is used when The Grand Hierophant doesn't have a group of allies to enhance or isn't currently concentrating on a spell.

#### Wrath of the Desert
The Grand Hierophant summons this storm at the start of the fight and positions it to impact the highest number of targets. If players scatter, he directs the storm toward ranged attackers, aiming to disable their attack options.

#### Casket of Souls
When The Grand Hierophant uses the casket of souls, his strategy shifts. While he will still cast *skull storm* on his initial turn, all subsequent legendary actions will be devoted to utilizing the power of the casket.

### Grant Hierophant Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Grand Hierophant come in the form of relics and religious icons he carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Liche Priest Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.

## Lore of <Br> Liche-Priests
This ancient lore of magic was <br> developed by the liche-priests of <br> the long-gone Tomb Kingdom <br> empire. The undying liche-priests <br> are still its primary practitioners, but <br> the secrets of this lore have slipped out <br> into the hands of other desert peoples <br> and arcane archeologists. Its magic <br> focuses on incantations designed to bolster <br> the effectiveness of soldiers, magic that <br> harnesses the power of the desert, and curses <br> that conjure the underworld spirits and punish <br> trespassers. The following spells are examples <br> of the types of magic users of the Lore of <br> Liche-Preists often wield.

- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You imbue a weapon within range with the essence of death. When this weapon hits a creature, the target becomes cursed for the spell's duration. At the start of your turn, each creature cursed this way within 90 feet of you takes 1d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target an additional weapon for each slot level above 1st. Using a 3rd-level spell slot or higher increases the damage by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 1st.

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You attempt to drain the vitality of a creature within range, leaving it feeble and vulnerable. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or have its speed halved and its Strength and Dexterity scores reduced to 1. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Constitution saving throw, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration becomes 24 hours and the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a short or long rest. If you use an 8th-level spell slot, the spell lasts until dispelled and no longer requires Concentration; the affected creature can only attempt a new saving throw after completing a long rest.

___

You summon a potent gust of wind, forming a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This wind then moves in a straight line up to 30 feet in a direction you choose. When the sphere initially forms, any Medium or smaller creature or unsecured object within its area is lifted and carried by the wind for the distance it travels. Creatures can choose to resist and remain stationary instead of being carried by the wind.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Skull Storm
*6th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tooth)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Warlock
___

You summon a swirling tempest of skulls in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. This whirlwind lasts for the spell's duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The tempest spreads around corners, seeping through openings large enough for a tiny creature.
When you cast the spell, choose a direction. When the storm first appears, and at the start of each of your turns afterward, the swirling skulls move 30 feet in the chosen direction.

Any creature the storm passes though when moving must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can direct a cluster of skulls from the storm to streak toward a point you can see within 30 feet of the sphere. Once the skulls reach their destination or hit a solid surface, they lash out, biting at everything nearby. Every creature within 5 feet of where they stopped must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. The skulls then return to the storm.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, damage dealt by the storm and the skull clusters increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Tomb Strike
*Necromancy cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Wizard, Warlock
___

You or one of your undead servants lash out with a surge of malignant power. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within 5 feet of you or a willing undead creature you can see within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** The spell’s damage increases by 1d12 when you reach 5th level (2d12), 11th level (3d12), and 17th level (4d12).

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> This document references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.
