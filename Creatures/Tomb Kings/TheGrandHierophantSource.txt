> ***Master of the Eternal Dead.*** Whenever The Grand Hierophant casts a spell of the first level or higher that targets one or more undead creatures, he can choose for any number of those undead to regain 10 hit points.
>
> ***Scroll of the Cursing Word (1/day).*** As a bonus action or as a reaction to The Grand Hierophant seeing a spell being cast with a verbal component, The Grand Hierophant curses each creature of its choice within 300 feet of it for 10 minutes. While cursed, when a creature casts a spell with a verbal component, it must make a DC 15 ability check using its spellcasting ability. On a success, the curse ends for that creature. On a failed save, it takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage per level of the spell. If it fails by 10 or more (DC 5), the spell has no effect and is wasted as its mouth is filled with sand and dung beetles.
>
> ***Staff of The Grand Hierophant.*** When The Grand Hierophant casts a spell that requires concentration while holding this staff, he can have a willing creature within 60 feet of him also concentrate on the spell. The spell does not end if The Grand Hierophant loses concentration as long as the other creature is still concentrating on the spell. The other creature loses concentration if it is 60 or more feet away from The Grand Hierophant, is out of line of sight from The Grand Hierophant, or The Grand Hierophant concentrates on another spell.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Reanimate.*** The Grand Hierophant chooses the remains of an undead creature of CR 4 or lower within 60 feet of it that was destroyed within the last 24 hours. That creature returns to undeath with 15 (4d4 + 5) hit points. The undead is restored of any missing body parts.

> ### Legendary Actions

>
> **Check.** The Grand Hierophant makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Drag Down.** A creature that just took its turn and is restrained by The Grand Hierophant's *black tentacles* spell must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and isn't knocked prone.
>
> **Gust of Skulls.** The Grand Hierophant uses the bonus action option from its *skull storm* spell (The spell must be active for it to use this action).

>
> **Tenacious Will.** If The Grand Hierophant is suffering from an effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of his next turn, he may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. He can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Incantation (Cost 2 Actions).** The Grand Hierophant casts a spell of 3rd level or lower.

### Optional Ability: <br> Wrath of the Desert

The Grand Hierophant is protected by the gods of the desert, who can project their power at his behest. If you give him this ability, increase his CR by 1.     
 
 **Sand Storm (Recharges on a short rest).**
At the start of the round on Initiative count 20, The Grand Hierophant can create a 100-foot tall sandstorm with a 20-foot radius centered at a point within 120 feet of him. This ability can be activated even if The Grand Hierophant is incapacitated or surprised. The storm spreads around corners and lasts for 10 minutes, or until it is dismissed by The Grand Hierophant (no action required) or he dies.

The area within the storm is considered difficult terrain and is heavily obscured for creatures other than The Grand Hierophant. Additionally, ranged weapon attack rolls are made with disadvantage if their path passes through the storm.

On initiative count 20 of subsequent rounds, The Grand Hierophant can move the storm up to 20 feet in any direction. If the storm moves over a creature or if a creature ends its turn within the storm, that creature must make a Strength saving throw (The Grand Hierophant ignores this effect). On a failed save, the creature takes 6d6 slashing damage, is pulled 10 feet toward the storm's center, and if the creature is concentrating on a spell, it makes its concentration saving throw caused by the damage with disadvantage.

### Casket of Souls
  
The Grand Hierophant can be attuned to a Casket of Souls (whose mechanics are described below.) While attuned, he gains the following special abilities and is considered a CR 20 creature:
  
* He is immune to damage and cannot be moved or teleported against his will while within 5 feet of the casket.
  
* He can unleash the casket's souls (as described in the casket mechanics below) using a legendary action. The initial target for the souls must be the creature that just took its turn.
  
* He can use a legendary action to teleport the casket and himself to an unoccupied space within 15 feet of the casket.

### Casket of Souls Mechanics

The casket of souls is a Large magical object with 150 hit points and an Armor Class (AC) of 17. A creature can attune to the casket if it has proficiency in the Religion skill and both a Wisdom and Intelligence score of 14 or higher. 

A creature attuned to the casket can perform a minute-long ritual to summon it to an unoccupied space within 5 feet.

For the purposes of determining an encounter's challenge rating and XP award, treat a casket of souls with a user as an additional CR 9 (5,000 XP) creature.

#### Unleashing the Souls

The creature attuned to the casket of souls and within 5 feet of it can use its action to release the tormented souls within, targeting a creature it can see within 300 feet. The souls can then jump to another creature within 15 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 15 feet of that one. A creature can't be targeted by this ability more than once per turn. A targeted creature must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

If a creature fails the saving throw by 10 or more (DC 5) or if the damage from this ability reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the casket begins extracting the target's soul. This effect ends if the casket is destroyed. The affected creature repeats the saving throw at the start of the casket user's next turn, with disadvantage if it has 0 hit points. On a success, the effect ends. If the creature fails, it dies instantly, and its soul is trapped within the casket until the casket is destroyed. While a creature's soul is trapped this way, it can't be resurrected.

#### Arcane Conduit

Additionally, creatures within 150 feet of the casket have a -1 penalty to their spell save DC and spell attack rolls. The creature attuned to the casket can choose for a creature to receive a +1 bonus instead. This modifier remains even if the creature attuned to the casket dies.

#### The Casket's Destruction

If the casket of souls is destroyed, the trapped souls are freed and lash out at all nearby creatures. Each creature within 30 feet of the casket must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### The Grand Hierophant Tactics 
The Grand Hierophant represents the pinnacle of liche priest spellcasters. Always accompanied by a minimum of three elite undead warriors, The Grand Hierophant is a tactician who prioritizes his own safety over dealing direct damage. His potent ability to heal and resurrect his fallen soldiers makes him excel in prolonged engagements, often outlasting his enemies.

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word 
This ability is triggered in reaction to spellcasting threats. If any spellcaster manages to negate the curse, they immediately become the primary target for The Grand Hierophant and his minions.

#### The Grant Hierophant's Staff 
The Grand Hierophant strategically shares his concentration with the healthiest minion, ensuring it is not already paralyzed or vulnerable to incoming attacks. Furthermore, The Grand Hierophant can use the staff to concentrate on a variety of spells, each unlocking unique legendary actions. Below is a prioritized list detailing which spells he should cast first to harness their associated legendary actions.

##### Skull Storm
On its initial turn, The Grand Hierophant casts *skull storm*, targeting two or more enemies. After this, he deploys his Gust of Skulls legendary action whenever he can affect two or more targets again.

##### Black Tentacles
If The Grand Hierophant identifies two or more targets with low Dexterity and *skull storm* is no longer available, he will cast *black tentacles*. Once enemies are restrained, he will use his Drag Down legendary action. However, he avoids using this action on players with a high Strength saving throw, like barbarians.

##### Decrepify
This spell is reserved for scenarios where neither allies nor enemies are closely grouped for The Grand Hierophant's Incantation spells. The ideal targets are martial characters with weak Constitution saving throws. Once cast, he will use his Wither legendary action at the earliest opportunity.

\columnbreak

#### Incantation
The Grand Hierophant should cast spells using his Incantation legendary action when he can affect three or more powerful allies, particularly undead with a CR (Challenge Rating) of 3 or higher. However, these spells are of secondary priority if he can target three or more enemies with *black tentacles* or *skull storm*.

##### Specific Incantations and Their Uses:

**Guiding Wind:** 
* This spell should be deployed to swiftly move a large group of undead into melee combat.

* It is useful for allowing ranged archers to disengage from close combat.

* It acts as a potential escape route for The Grand Hierophant when surrounded. 

* Caution is advised, as adversaries within the spell's radius might also choose to be moved by it.

#####
**Incantation of Zeal vs. Incantation of Protection:**

* *Incantation of zeal* should generally be given priority over *incantation of protection*.

* However, if opponents possess bludgeoning weapons and The Grand Hierophant has skeletons under his command, or if a significant portion of the enemy group consists of martial classes using physical weaponry, then *incantation of protection* should be prioritized.

#### Tomb Strike Legendary Action
This action is used when The Grand Hierophant doesn't have a group of allies to enhance or isn't (NOTE: should this be *is*?) currently concentrating on a spell.

#### Wrath of the Desert
The Grand Hierophant summons this storm at the start of the fight and positions it to impact the highest number of targets. If players scatter, he directs the storm toward ranged attackers, aiming to disable their attack options.

#### Casket of Souls
When The Grand Hierophant uses the casket of souls, his strategy shifts. While he will still cast *skull storm* on his initial turn, all subsequent legendary actions will be devoted to utilizing the power of the casket.
