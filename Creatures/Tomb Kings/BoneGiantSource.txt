> ***Animated Construct.*** The bone giant is infused with the souls of the dead. Its type is Undead in addition to Construct when determining the effects of features such as a paladinâ€™s Divine Smite.
>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The bone giant is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form. 
>
> ***Powerful Draw.*** The bone giant uses its Strength rather than its Dexterity when determining the attack and damage bonuses for attacks with its great bow.
>
> ***Sacred Arrows.*** The bone giant's ranged attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
>
> ***Sleeping Giant.*** While the bone giant remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an inanimate statue. It is also immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as to all divination spells or other magic that would detect it is a creature. 
>
> ***Turning Defiance.***  The bone giant has advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The bone giant makes two attacks with its greatsword or two attacks with its Bow of The Desert.
>
> ***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (6d6 + 8) slashing damage. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by the attack, the bone giant may make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature within 10 feet of the original target and within range of the weapon. This attack does not gain another attack if it reduces the new target to 0 hit points.
>
> ***Bow of The Desert.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 300/900 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by the attack, the bone giant may make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature directly behind the first target and within range of the weapon. This attack does not gain another attack if it reduces the new target to 0 hit points.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the bone giant's choice that is within 120 feet of the bone giant and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the bone giant's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
