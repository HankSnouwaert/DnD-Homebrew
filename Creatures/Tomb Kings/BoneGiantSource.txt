## Bone Giant

Though these mighty beings appear to be the skeletons of enormous giants, they are, in fact, constructs carved from wood and stone. In ancient times, they were created as monumental tributes to legendary kings and heroes. As the death priests learned to bind souls and manipulate the death, they began binding powerful spirits to these statues. These spirits remain dormant for ages at a time until they are called upon to serve their lost kingdom. 

When they're stirred into action, bone giants draw huge bows and unleash blessed arrows the size of a ballista bolt capable. Even those who manage to overcome the sheer terror of the bone giant's presence and engage it in close quarters will still need to contend with melee attacks capable of pulverizing most humanoids in a single blow. And those who survive long enough to land a blow will be unlikely to overcome the defenses of its nearly indestructible frame.

>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The bone giant makes two attacks with its greatsword or two attacks with its Bow of The Desert.
>
> ***Greatsword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 29 (6d6 + 8) slashing damage. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by the attack, the bone giant may make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature within 10 feet of the original target and within range of the weapon. This attack does not gain another attack if it reduces the new target to 0 hit points.
>
> ***Bow of The Desert.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 300/900 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (3d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by the attack, the bone giant may make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature directly behind the first target and within range of the weapon. This attack does not gain another attack if it reduces the new target to 0 hit points.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the bone giant's choice that is within 120 feet of the bone giant and aware of it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the bone giant's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.
