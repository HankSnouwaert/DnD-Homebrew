## Screaming <Br> Skull Catapult
In the desolate landscapes of the Tomb Kingdoms there exists a weapon of terrifying power and macabre design - the Screaming Skull Catapult. These formidable war machines, as much a symbol of dread as they are of destruction, stand as a testament to the dark ingenuity of their creators.

**Eerie Construct and Crew.** Crafted from a blend of stone and metal, these catapults are fashioned to resemble bones, with macabre motifs and glyphs adorning their structure. Operated by skeletal crewmen, these catapults loom like grim sentinels on the battlefield, their very presence a chilling sight. The crewmen, bound to their eternal task, work with mechanical precision, unfazed by the chaos of war around them of the screaming of the catapult's ammunition.

**Cursed Ammunition.** This horrifying ammunition is crafted from the skulls of slain enemies, each one subjected to dark rituals by the liche-priests. These incantations imbue the skulls with sorcerous curses, causing them to glow with eldritch flames and emit the tormented screams of their previous life's final moments. The sound of these screaming skulls is not merely the byproduct of their curse but serves as a weapon in its own right.

> ***Screaming Skull.*** Each screaming skull catapult has 30 pieces of ammunition built into it that can be removed as needed. This ammunition lets out horrifying screeches that can be heard up to 300 feet away as long as it is within 30 feet of the catapult. Any non-undead creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of any screaming ammunition and can hear it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw.
>
> On a failure, the creature is frightened until the end of its next turn. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 10), while the creature is frightened, it can't take reactions and must take the Dash action on each of its turns and move away from screaming skull catapult by the safest available route.

>
> ***Fire.*** The screaming skull catapult fires a skull that is set ablaze and rains down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet and shatters. Each creature in a 15-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) piercing damage. Each non-undead creature within 30 feet of the point must then make a saving throw against the effects of the Screaming Skull feature.

&emsp;**Terrifying Barrage.** As the catapults launch their ghastly ammunition, the air fills with the harrowing screams of the damned, creating a symphony of terror. Upon impact, the skulls explode in a burst of spectral fire, causing both physical and psychological devastation, as the screams and the violent eruption sow panic and fear among enemy ranks.

### Screaming Skull Catapult Tactics 
The best targets for screaming skull catapults are melee fighters, as the fear effects of the screaming skulls can prevent them from closing in. Additionally, the constant screaming of the catapult's ammunition means it can create a protected area for other undead ranged units attempting to avoid melee combat.

### Screaming Skull Catapult Loot

Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from these screaming scull catapults are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Investigation) or Intelligence (Masonâ€™s Tools) check. Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from the crewmen come in the form of relics and weapon fragments they leave behind. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (History)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Screaming Skull Catapult Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
