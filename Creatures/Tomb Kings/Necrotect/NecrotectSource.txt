### Necrotect Tactics
The necrotects act as frontline support for other undead constructs. They also possess a plethora of out-of-combat spells that can be used to secure places they have built, such as temples or tombs. 

Although necrotects are highly intelligent, they are quick to anger if any of their constructs are destroyed or damaged. This means a necrotic will make its decisions on which creature to attack based on the amount of damage dealt to its constructs. 

It uses the Wrath of the Creator ability anytime it can reach a target with the ability and hit it. It prioritizes using Restoration on the largest construct present, as this will be the most precious to it. Necrotect Masters save their uses of Fortify for such constructs.

#### Necrotect Visionary Tactics
Necrotect visionaries follow similar tactics to normal necrotects, using Imbue rather than Fortify on the largest construct available. The imbued construct always goes after the target that is the largest threat to itself or positions itself for a Soul Jolt if the enemies are close enough together to be hit by the ability. It has two unique legendary actions it uses under the following circumstances:

**Frantic Fervor.** This is used similarly to Wrath of the Creator; it will use this ability whenever it doesn't need to use Tenacious Will, or there aren't enough targets for Soul Jolt.

**Soul Jolt.** This is used whenever it can hit three or more targets. Constructs should attempt to position themselves in the largest groups of enemies for this ability.

### Necrotect Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from necrotects come in the form of relics and tools they carry. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an Intelligence check using proficiency in any type of Artisan's Tools. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Necrotect Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
