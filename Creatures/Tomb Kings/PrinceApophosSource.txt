## The Doom of Apophos

Hear now, O listener, the tale of Apophos, whose heinous deeds did stain the earth, and of the divine retribution that bound him to an eternity of torment. In the days when the Ancient Kings ruled with golden splendor, Apophos, a prince of noble blood, was consumed by an unquenchable thirst to seize the throne of his realm. His heart, turned to darkness, conceived acts of unspeakable violence. In the silence of a single night, his gilded dagger did rake across the throats of his royal kin, sparing none. When the dawn’s golden rays illuminated the blood-soaked halls, Apophos stood before his people, proclaiming himself their rightful lord with a glee born of madness.

The folk of the city, beholding the murderer who dared claim their fealty, were filled with righteous fury. Soldiers and priests, as one, descended upon the traitorous wretch, dragging him to the great temple at the heart of the city. There, Apophos was denied the sacred rites of mummification and the golden afterlife promised to his kin. Instead, bound within a sarcophagus, he wailed as hundreds of ravenous scarabs were poured upon him, the stone lid sealed fast. Even the mighty walls of the temple could not muffle his anguished cries as the beetles tore his flesh, bit by merciless bit, until naught remained but bones picked clean. These, with utter disdain, were cast into the desert’s embrace, to be buried and forgotten beneath the shifting sands.

Yet the weight of his crimes bore his sin-stained soul to the underworld, where the gods of that shadowed realm claimed him for eternal torment. But Apophos, cunning as he was, demanded the divine right to speak before his soul was weighed upon the scales of divinity. With guile, he proposed a bargain to elude his fate: should he find a soul equal to his own upon the gods’ scales, it would take his place in the underworld, and he would ascend to the golden realms of the afterlife.

The gods, in their inscrutable wisdom, consented to this pact. Thus, Apophos was returned to the land of the living, no longer a man but a cursed monstrosity. His form, a writhing swarm of the very scarabs that devoured him, was crowned with a bleached skull, a grotesque mockery of the human figure. In a limb of scuttling insects, he clutched the gilded dagger, ever dripping with the blood of his kin, poised to claim the soul that would free him. Across the land he crawled, his cold, empty sockets ever seeking a victim to sate his jailers’ demand. When such a prize is sighted, Apophos is relentless—slipping through the smallest cracks, burrowing beneath the earth, or scattering into the air, only to reform in his grim, misshapen guise. Those who dare stand between the specter and his prey are fools, for no blade can halt him. His limbs, sundered by steel, reform as a living tide, consuming all in its path.

Thus has it been, decade upon decade, as Apophos drags soul after soul to the scales of the gods, each failing to match the weight of his blackened spirit. Ever he returns to the surface, condemned to search in vain until the end of days. No soul, it is whispered, shall ever equal the traitor prince’s, and so his punishment endures—a ceaseless quest beneath the unyielding gaze of the gods.

### Combat Guide: Prince Apophos
Prince Apophos focuses on eliminating the target marked by Soul Reaper while managing other threats. The prince prioritizes killing the marked target above all else, while the displaced scarab swarm supports by re-forming with the prince or disrupting vulnerable enemies.

#### Prince Apophos Tactics
The prince focuses on killing the target marked by Soul Reaper, fleeing once the target is dead or escapes, ignoring other combatants. The prince remains cautious of other foes to avoid being overwhelmed.

##### Actions
* Use Multiattack when enemies are separated, targeting two spellcasters with Infesting Strike to enable Disruptive Parasites, and the marked target with Gilded Dagger.

* Use Infesting Breath instead of Multiattack to hit four or more enemies, or at least three enemies if two have low Dexterity saves, even if it means not targeting the marked target.

#### Bonus Actions
* Use Charge to move toward the marked target or spellcasters in a straight line, then use any remaining movement to burrow or climb to avoid counterattacks.

#### Reactions
* Use Disruptive Parasites when a spellcaster with burrowed scarabs casts a spell.

#### Displaced Scarab Swarm Tactics

* Use Fuse if within 5 feet of the prince or his remains to restore a Swarm Body layer or revive him.

* Use Bite on nearby enemies if unable to reach the prince in one turn, targeting spellcasters concentrating on important spells or ranged attackers to impose disadvantage.

### Epic Battle: The Undying Swarm

If you wish to make Prince Apophos into a more powerful threat, give him 8 layers of scarabs instead of 5. This increases his CR to 15.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Devouring Mass.*** If the prince starts his turn in the space of a dead creature that’s Large or smaller, that creature is stripped of all flesh, leaving only bones and objects it was wearing or carrying. Any creature with flesh reduced to 0 hit points by Piercing damage dealt by the prince dies and is stripped of flesh in this way.
>
> ***Scarab Body.*** The prince’s body is made of 5 layers of scarabs, each with 20 hit points. When the prince takes damage, the current layer absorbs it. If a layer is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and a Displaced Scarab Swarm appears in a space (2d4 × 5) feet away from the prince in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2, east; 3, south; 4, west) that lasts for 1 hour. The swarm acts on Initiative Count 1. The prince regains all layers after finishing a Long Rest.
>
> ***Soul Reaper (1/Day).*** When the prince rolls Initiative or at the start of his turn, the prince can mark one target he can see. For the next 24 hours, if the target dies while the prince is within 60 feet of it, the target’s soul is trapped within the prince until the prince is destroyed.
>
> ***Spider Climb.*** The prince can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
>
> ***Splinter Body.*** If the prince fails a saving throw, he can choose to succeed instead and take 20 Force damage.
>
> ***Swarm.*** The prince can occupy another creature’s space and vice versa, and the prince can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny insect. The prince can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The prince makes two Infesting Strike attacks and one Gilded Dagger attack.
>
> ***Infesting Strike.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 Piercing damage plus 4 (1d8) Piercing damage for each layer of scarabs the prince has. If the target is a creature, undead scarabs burrow into its body, causing 2 (1d4) Piercing damage at the start of each of the creature’s turns. This effect can stack multiple times. A creature within reach can use an action to make a DC 16 Wisdom (Medicine) check with a weapon or object dealing Fire, Piercing, or Slashing damage, dealing 1d4 damage of that type to the target. On a success, all burrowed scarabs are destroyed. The creature can choose to gain advantage on the check by dealing 3d4 damage instead.
>
> ***Gilded Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (3d4 + 4) Piercing damage, or 19 (6d4 + 4) Piercing damage if the target is marked by Soul Reaper. The dagger magically returns to the prince immediately after a ranged attack.
>
> ***Infesting Breath.*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 16, each creature in a 30-foot cone. <bR> *Failure:* The creature is automatically hit by an Infesting Strike attack. <bR> *Failure by 10 or More:* The attack is a critical hit.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Charge.*** The prince moves up to his speed in a straight line toward an enemy he can see.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Disruptive Parasites.*** *Trigger:* A creature with burrowed scarabs casts a spell within 90 feet of the prince. <bR> *Response:* *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 16, the triggering creature. <bR> *Failure:* The spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If the spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn’t expended.
