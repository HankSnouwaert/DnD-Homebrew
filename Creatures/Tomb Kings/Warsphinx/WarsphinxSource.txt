### Warsphinx Enhancments
If you wish to enhance the power of a warsphinx, you can give it one of the following upgrades. Each upgrade increases its CR by 1.

####  Burning Roar
*The war sphinx can let loose a roar that burns the air with the heat of a funeral pyre and the force to shatter bones. The roar's raw power can stop even the most stalwart warriors in their tracks.*
 
The warsphinx gains the Burning Roar action, which it can use in place of its Thunder Crash during a Multiattack.

***Burning Roar (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The warsphinx lets out a roar that burns the air in a 60-foot cone in front of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage plus 17 (5d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 14), it is stunned until the end of the warsphinx's next turn.

#### Envenomed Stinger
*The warsphinx is enhanced with a scorpion's tail, complete with a stinger the size of a man. Its venom causes blood to boil and limbs to freeze.* 


The warsphinx gains the Sting attack action, which it can use in place of one of its attacks during a Multiattack.
 
***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, and the effect ends on a successful one. If the creature fails this repeated saving throw by 5 more (DC 14), it becomes paralyzed until the poison ends.

> ***Multiattack.*** The warsphinx can use its Frightful Presence. It can then use its Thunder Crash or make two attacks: one with its Bite and one with its Claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 19). Until this grapple ends, the warsphinx can't Bite or Claw another target or use its Thunder Crash.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is prone, it deals 46 (6d12 + 7) piercing damage instead.

>
> ***Thunder Crash.*** The warsphinx rears up and slams down to let loose a shockwave. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from it must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw, taking 22 (5d8) damage and being knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage and not being knocked prone on a successful save. If the creature fails by 5 or more (DC 14), or automatically fails, it can't stand up until after the end of its next turn. Objects and structures in this area take double the thunder damage dealt.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the warsphinx's choice that is within 120 feet of the warsphinx and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the warsphinx's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

### Warsphinx Tactics
Warsphinxes are versatile monsters. They can ambush players by sneaking up on them or by remaining motionless and disguising themselves as statues. They can take down single targets with their pounces, or they can use their Thunder Crash to blast groups of enemies.

It's generally best for the warsphinx to start combat by getting a running start to empower its Thunder Crash and use it on the largest group of opponents. If one of them fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it will not be able to stand up, allowing the warsphinx to gain bonus damage on its Bite attack. If it is able to frighten the majority of its enemies with Frightful Presence, it will run off with a grappled target.

#### Warsphinx Enhancement Tactics

Warsphinxes are able to gain two of the following upgrades:

**Envenomed Stinger:** This is used in place of its Claw attack on a target that is not frightened of the warsphinx. When a more intelligent creature is guiding the Warsphinx in battle, it will prioritize using the stinger against creatures with low Constitution.

**Burning Roar:** This is immediately used when it can hit three or more targets. If any targets are stunned, it will use its Thunder Crash on them.

### Warsphinx Loot
The valuable items looted from warsphinxes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Warsphinx Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Warsphinx Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-10  | 2d4(5) 50gp Items |
|  11-16 | 2d4(5) 100gp Items | 
|  17-23 | 2d8(8) 100gp Items  |  
|  24-26 | 1d6(3) 1,000gp Items |  
|  27+ |  1d6(3) 2,000gp Items | 

#### Example Warsphinx Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.

##### Example Warsphinx Item Names
|1d4 | 50gp | 100gp Item | 1,000gp Item |  2,000gp Item |
