## War Sphinxes
The war sphinxes stand as towering testaments to the might and ingenuity of the ancient Tomb Kingdoms. These colossal constructs, resembling massive, feline beasts carved from stone, embody the fearsome power and eternal vigilance of their creators. 

Despite their monumental, heavy stone bodies, war sphinxes possess a grace and agility that belies their size. With movements mirroring the predatory cats of the desert, they pounce and shred through enemy ranks, their huge teeth and claws leaving nothing but devastation in their wake. Perhaps most terrifying is their ability to rear up and slam down with thunderous force, pulverizing anything unfortunate enough to be caught beneath.

These majestic constructs are often equipped with war howdahs, battle platforms manned by tomb guards who direct these beasts into the heart of the conflict. From these vantage points, the tomb guards rain arrows upon the enemy while guiding the war sphinxes to maximize their destructive potential. Many pharaohs of the Tomb Kingdoms, ever seeking to demonstrate their might, have personal war sphinxes that guard their inner burial sanctums. In times of war, these pharaohs ride into battle atop their war sphinxes, commanding respect and fear on the battlefield.

The creators of these war sphinxes, master artisans of the Tomb Kingdoms, continually seek to enhance their creations, striving to outdo both themselves and their rivals. As a result, many war sphinxes are not only functional weapons of war but also masterpieces of art. They are often adorned with elaborate ornaments, engravings, and even magical enhancements. Some boast massive, venom-filled scorpion tails, adding a lethal sting to their arsenal, while others are enchanted with fiery roars capable of scorching anything <br> in their path, turning the tide of battle with a single, <br> incendiary breath.

### War Sphinx Enhancments
If you wish to enhance the power of a war sphinx, you can give it one of the following upgrades. Each upgrade increases its CR by 1.

####  Burning Roar
*The war sphinx can let loose a roar that burns the air with the heat of a funeral pyre and the force to shatter bones. The roar's raw power can stop even the most stalwart warriors in their tracks.*
 
The war sphinx gains the Burning Roar action, which it can use in place of its Thunder Crash during a Multiattack.

***Burning Roar (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The war sphinx lets out a roar that burns the air in a 60-foot cone in front of it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 17 (5d6) fire damage plus 17 (5d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more (DC 14), it is stunned until the end of the war sphinx's next turn.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br>

#### Envenomed Stinger
*The war sphinx is enhanced with a scorpion's tail, complete with a stinger the size of a man. Its venom causes blood to boil and limbs to freeze.* 


The war sphinx gains the Sting attack action, which it can use in place of one of its attacks during a Multiattack.
 
***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 17 (5d6) poison damage and is poisoned. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and is not poisoned. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw. It takes 10 (3d6) poison damage on a failed save, and the effect ends on a successful one. If the creature fails this repeated saving throw by 5 more (DC 14), it becomes paralyzed until the poison ends.

If the creature fails by 5 or more (DC 14), or automatically fails, it can't stand up until after the end of its next turn. Objects and structures in this area take double the thunder damage dealt.
>
> ***Frightful Presence.*** Each creature of the sphinx's choice that is within 120 feet of the sphinx and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the sphinx's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.

### War Sphinx Tactics
War sphinxes are versatile monsters. They can ambush players by sneaking up on them or by remaining motionless and disguising themselves as statues. They can take down single targets with their pounces, or they can use their Thunder Crash to blast groups of enemies.

It's generally best for the war sphinx to start combat by getting a running start to empower its Thunder Crash and use it on the largest group of opponents. If one of them fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it will not be able to stand up, allowing the war sphinx to gain bonus damage on its Bite attack. If it is able to frighten the majority of its enemies with Frightful Presence, it will run off with a grappled target.

#### War Sphinx Enhancement Tactics

War sphinxes are able to gain two of the following upgrades:

**Burning Roar:** This is immediately used when it can hit three or more targets. If any targets are stunned, it will use its Thunder Crash on them.

**Envenomed Stinger:** This is used in place of its Claw attack on a target that is not frightened of the war sphinx. When a more intelligent creature is guiding the war sphinx in battle, it will prioritize using the stinger against creatures with low Constitution.

\columnbreak

### War Sphinx Loot
The valuable items looted from war sphinxes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from their remains. This harvesting can usually be done using an **Intelligence (History)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make an Intelligence (Jewler's Tools) check to harvest gems. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### War Sphinx Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### War Sphinx Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-10  | 2d4(5) 50gp Items |
|  11-16 | 2d4(5) 100gp Items | 
|  17-23 | 2d8(9) 100gp Items  |  
|  24-26 | 1d6(3) 1,000gp Items |  
|  27+ |  1d6(3) 2,000gp Items | 

#### Example War Sphinx Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.

# Howdahs
War howdahs are small armored structured mounted to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use different types of howdahs in your games. They can be applied to howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own howdahs. 

## Howdah Rules
Howdahs are generally structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger war beast of some kind. The creatures within the howdah are referred to as riders, and the creature the howdah is mounted upon is referred to as its steed. If one of the riders is controlling the steed, that creature is the pilot. Howdah riders and steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a howdah or its steed, the howdah and its steed are moved together.

* **Controlled & Independant Steeds.** The howdah's steed can be a controlled or independent mount as described in the player's handbook. If it is controlled, there must be a pilot who is controlling it.



\columnbreak

* **Entering & Exiting Howdahs.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah. Any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. Each passenger already inside the howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.



### Howdah Saving Throws
While objects normally automatically fail all Strength, Dexterity, and Constituion saving throws, howdahs are active parts of combat, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, you can use the following rules when howdahs are subject to such saving throws.

  style='position:absolute;left:-290px;bottom:140px;transform:rotate(0deg)' />

\pagebreakNum

#### Strength & Dexterity Saves
Howdahs equipped on an unencumbered steed do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as they can rely on their steed to make the save for them. If a howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, its steed must make the saving throw against the effect. If the steed succeeds on the save, the howdah passes the save.

#### Constitution Saves
Howdahs can make their own Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is mounted on a steed.

### Opportunity Attacks
When the howdah steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the howdah itself. Passengers cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures outside the howdah.

### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures inside a howdah are considered to be within 5 feet of each other.

### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of three of the steed's largest hit dice.

### Teleporting
If the steed is teleported, the howdah and its riders can choose to teleport with it.

### Falling Howdahs
When a howdah's steed falls from a height of 10 feet or more, it and all its riders take fall damage as usual, and the riders fall prone.

### Repairing Howdahs
If a howdah has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting repairs, provided it has the necessary tools and parts. After 1 hour of work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus if proficient with the required tools. On success, the howdah regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. On failure, the howdah doesn't regain any hit points, but repairs can be reattempted with the same tools and parts.

### Howdah Destruction
When a howdah is destroyed, riders that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of its steed.

## Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, howdahs have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Howdah DC 
Whenever the howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, that creature uses this value for the DC.

### Damage Threshold
Most howdahs possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the howdah takes the damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the howdah's hit points.

###  Steed Size
This is the minimum size a creature must be to be the howdah's steed. If a creature ever becomes too small to carry the howdah, the howdah falls off the creature and is knocked over as though its steed was knocked prone, described in the Prone Howdahs section.

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride in the howdah comfortably. Additional creatures may be able to fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the howdah at the DM's discretion.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the howdah adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning howdah, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the howdah is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits the howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

### Siege Weapons
A howdah may have one or more built-in siege weapons. These siege weapons are built into the howdah and share its Hit Points, AC, and Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the howdah is destroyed. These siege weapons can only be operated by riders in the howdah, and riders can't provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the howdah while operating these weapons. The weapons can't be used if the howdah is not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.
