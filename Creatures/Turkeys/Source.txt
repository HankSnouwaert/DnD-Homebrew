# Turkeys

These fowl are prized by hunters and a common feature at large celebratory feasts.  Some domesticated variations of turkey are kept by farmers specifically to provide food to locals.  These turkeys are incapable of flight and bred to provide ample supplies of meat.  

Wild turkeys are capable of short bursts of flight which they use to escape prey and ascend into the safety of tree-tops.  However, turkeys don't fly for extended durations and spend most of their time foraging for food on the ground.  

Compared to most birds capable of flight, turkeys are relatively large, weighing up to 24 pounds and reaching 4 feet in length.  Their size, combined with their talons and aggressive behavior, can make them a threat to commoners.  

## Dungeon Turkeys
These eccentric fey spirits take the form of turkeys, though they often embellish their appearance with exotic color variations or off-beat articles of clothing.  They spend most of their time traveling to remote and dangerous locations where they will hide in out-of-the-way areas waiting to be discovered by adventurers.  These hiding places might include hidden alcoves, hard to reach chests, or inside of crumbling walls.  

Once adventurers have discovered a dungeon turkey, it will gleefully taunt its discoverers as it flees from their reach.  The turkey will make every attempt to goad adventurers into pursuing it as it escapes further afield into dangerous territory.  If the adventurers manage to slay or capture it, the turkey will congratulate them on a good chase before its spirit returns home.  The body it leaves behind will instantly transform into a magical, fully cooked turkey capable of replenishing the vitality and magical reserves of weary heroes.

**Magical Defenses.**
While dungeon turkeys enjoy being chased by adventurers, they are loath to make the chase easy.  Their innate elusiveness makes them very difficult to strike or grapple, they can blind onlookers with dazzling fey magic, and they can even reflect spells back upon their casters.  Especially powerful dungeon turkeys can even teleport to elude would-be captors.  

**Dramatic Chases.**
Some dungeon turkey pursuits are relatively straightforward, but most like to make the chase more interesting.  They will flee through dangerous terrain, goading adventurers to chase after them.  If the turkey escapes, it will usually find a new hiding spot, waiting to be discovered so it can repeat the game all over again.

Most dungeon turkeys have no interest in being pursued by monsters and other dungeon denizens and will usually avoid drawing their attention.  However, some particularly dramatic turkeys will wait until adventurers are engaged in a fight to pop out from a hiding spot and invite a chase mid-combat.

**Unusual Means and Motivations.** 
Dungeon turkeys generally don't provide a coherent explanation as to why they engage in the games they do beyond that 'it is just their nature.'  Sometimes they are sent by other powerful fey who wish to provide adventurers aid, provided they can earn it.  Whatever the reason, dungeon turkeys have a knack for making their way into even the most remote and dangerous of locations while avoiding the attention of  local creatures.
