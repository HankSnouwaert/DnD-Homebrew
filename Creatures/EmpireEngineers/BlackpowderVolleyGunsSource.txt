## Blackpowder Volley Guns
Volley guns unleash a barrage of leaden death on anything caught in their lethal stream of projectiles. This massive, wheeled firearm, its multiple barrels arranged in a rotating cylinder, features a hand-crank at the rear. One sharp turn of the crank spins the cylinder; as each loaded barrel swings to the top, a match or flint ignites the charge and lets loose a bullet. Cranked with haste, the gun roars out a broadside equal to an entire regiment of musketeers. In seconds, these iron reapers shred even the toughest foes.

Yet for all their ingenuity, volley guns remain fragile machines. The crank often jams under prolonged fire. Overheated barrels can crack, venting flames and shards of iron. In the worst cases, a misfire triggers a chain reaction: gunpowder ignites prematurely, the cylinder ruptures, and the entire gun erupts in a tidal wave of shrapnel and fire, swallowing crew and enemy alike.

### Thunder Hymn Volley Gun

On occasion, master engineers have collaborated with wizards versed in celestial lore, who can summon every manner of foul weather. From such rare partnerships emerges the Thunder Hymn Volley Gun.

Even at rest, the weapon betrays its enchantment: the barrels tremble with a faint vibration and emit a low, ceaseless hum, as though the sky itself whispers within the steel.

Most uncanny of all, the gun spurns black powder entirely. Its cylinders accept only hollow crystalline bullets: slender beads of glass that require no propellant. When the crank is turned, a gale of air roars into the chambers, ushering the mystical ammunition forward.

On impact, the bead bursts. Thunder, caged inside, erupts. The blast is sufficient to slay a man outright and fling his corpse backward.

Such weapons, though, are no safer than their mundane counterparts. Many of these marvels have been lost when the ammunition breaks prematurely, and a cascade of metal-shredding sonic waves obliterates all in the vicinity.

| 5-6 | Detonated | The gun explodes and is destroyed. Each creature in a 15-foot emanation must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 14. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 14 (4d6) Piercing damage plus 14 (4d6) Fire damage if it is a Blackpowder Volley Gun or 22 (4d10) Thunder damage if it is a Thunder Hymn Volley Gun. <br>  *Success:* Half damage. | None

### Volley Gun Tactics

Volley guns are aimed at the enemy with the lowest Dexterity.

Most operators crank the weapon three times only; a desperate or reckless gunner may crank it as many times as possible.

Thunder hymn volley guns will prefer to target creatures with low Dexterity that rely on melee attacks.

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.



## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

\columnbreak

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.


#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps Table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.
