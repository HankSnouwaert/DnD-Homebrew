## Engineers
*Eccentric Tinkerers Armed With Advanced Weaponry*<br>
**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** Individual <br>

Within the methodica districts of the great cities of the empires of order, where nobles and high merchants reside, can be found the chaotic workshops of eccentric engineers, shattering the refined formalities of those abodes. Such great thinkers, dismissed as uncouth by the upper ranks of society, pursue their obsessions with mad ingenuity and relentless determination, developing all manner of mechanical marvels while spending weeks in seclusion without rest. These endeavors are funded by wealthy nobles and imperial armies, both eager to capitalize on the next technological leap forward.

Such breakthroughs are unpredictable. Inspiration can strike engineers seemingly out of nowhere, sending them down paths that lead to convoluted and utterly useless contraptions. Yet, on occasion, these bursts of creativity yield weapons that can change the course of warfare for the nation.

Though most mechanically minded thinkers prefer isolation within their sanctums, surrounded by personal projects, some eagerly head to the battlefield with their newest contraptions of death to see their theoretical visions of destruction made real. Some bring personal devices to test, like the Mercurial Rifle, the Burning Tar Grenade Launcher, or the odd and gruesome Whirling Saw Blade, they are not trained soldiers. Still, their study of ballistics and intimate knowledge of their creations’ inner workings allow them to wield them with deadly mastery.

### Master Engineer

Others oversee the operation of great war machines they have constructed, from rocket batteries to volley guns, standing among artillery crews, ranting about trajectory arcs and wind speeds. Most crewmen under an engineer’s command consider them arrogant, believing the inventors lack practical experience. Such opinions are swiftly redirected when a precisely calibrated projectile wipes out an entire enemy regiment in white-hot cotton fire, or a towering monstrosity is obliterated with a single, pinpoint strike.

The longest-lived engineers develop a second instinct for oncoming danger, whether from an enemy or their own dubious constructs. They can judge and evade incoming fire mere seconds after launch, sense the slightest disturbance in their handiwork, and leap aside before catastrophic failure. They also extract maximum lethality from their weapons, ensuring peak efficiency, whether unleashing a near-endless stream of bullets or loosing flocks of bomb-strapped pigeons. None but the greatest masters can unleash a steady chain of death in such a manner.

### Tools of Choice
An engineer has two of the following tool options that it can use as an Action using its Use Tool action:

**Mercurial Rifle.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 200/600 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (4d10 + 3) Piercing damage. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw.* <br>
*Failure:* 12 (4d6) Piercing damage.

**Burning Tar Grenade.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 100/300 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 4 (1d8 + 3) Bludgeoning damage. The target and each creature within 10 feet of it must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw*.  
*Failure:* 18 (4d8) Fire damage and the target begins Burning, taking 4 (1d8) Fire damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends.

 **Repeater Gun.** The engineer makes three attacks with the following properties: <br>
*Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 100/300 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d8 + 3) Piercing damage.

**Pigeon Bomb (5/Day).** The engineer pulls out a **Pigeon**, attaches a 2-ounce tiny bomb to it (Tiny object; AC 10; 10 HP; immune to Poison and Psychic damage), and gives it a direction to start flying. The Pigeon acts on initiative count 1 (losing ties) and starts flying in the given direction. At the end of the pigeon’s next turn, the bomb falls off and detonates when it has fallen 60 feet or hits a solid surface, creature, or object.  
 Each creature within a 15-foot radius of the detonation must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw.*  
 *Failure:* 21 (6d6) Piercing damage.  
 *Success:* Half damage.

 **Thunder Barrel.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 45/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (4d8 + 3) Bludgeoning damage plus 22 (4d10) Thunder damage. The target must make a *Strength Saving Throw*.  <br>
 *Failure:* The target is pushed 20 feet away from the engineer.

**Spring-Loaded Mace.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 41 (7d10 + 3) Bludgeoning damage. The target must make a *Constitution Saving Throw.* <br> *Failure:* The target is *Dazed* until the start of the engineer’s next turn.

**Whirling Saw Blade.** The engineer makes three attacks with the following properties: <br> *Melee Weapon Attack:* reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (3d8 + 3) Slashing damage, and the target suffers a Wound*.

**Electro-Netter.** The engineer makes one attack with the following properties: <br> *Ranged Weapon Attack:* range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (5d10 + 3) Lightning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is Restrained by a net (AC 15; 15 HP; immune to Poison and Psychic damage; escape DC Strength check) until the net is destroyed.





<br>

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

> ##### New Condition: Wounds
>While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
>
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

### Engineer Tactics
Engineers are best paired with self-propelled vehicles or other siege weapons, allowing them to leverage their Master Ballistics ability and Avert Disaster ability.

When choosing their weapons for the Tools of Choice feature, it's usually best to equip them with a long-range weapon and a close-range weapon.

* Most long-range attacks should target groups of enemies, as they typically have a blast radius.

* Close-range attacks should be reserved for enemies that slip past the Engineer's artillery.

The different tools are categorized based on their range below:

#### Long Range
* Mercurial Rifle
* Burning Tar Grenade
* Repeater Gun
* Pigeon Bomb
* Thunder Barrel

#### Short Range
* Spring-Loaded Mace
* Whirling Saw Blade
* Electro-Netter

## Clockwork Steeds
*Powerful, Yet Somewhat Unreliable, Crank-Powered Horses*<br>
**Habitat:** Urban; **Treasure:** Individual <br>
Clockwork steeds are among the most temperamental marvels ever produced by engineers, automaton mounts forged of brass, steel, and stubborn optimism. Designed to replace living warhorses with tireless constructs, these machines clatter forward on articulated limbs driven by tightly wound spring-loaded pistons and clockwork gearing. Each must be wound by a heavy crank system, often mounted on the flank or beneath the saddle, requiring a great effort before the machine is ready to operate. Once fully primed, the steed surges to life in bursts of hissing steam and rhythmic clanking, capable of galloping at alarming speeds across open terrain.

Though awe-inspiring in motion, the steeds are notoriously difficult to manage. Engineers often struggle to coordinate their movements with the jerking gait of the automaton, and it is not uncommon for the steed to abruptly seize, stall, or lurch in the wrong direction when gears misalign. Some require periodic re-cranking mid-journey, leading to awkward battlefield pauses or frantic winding under fire. Despite these shortcomings, the clockwork steed represents the dream of replacing unreliable biology with engineered precision, and for those eccentric enough to ride them, they are a badge of honor and defiance against the limitations of nature.


### Clockwork Steed Tactics
Clockwork steeds with four or more charges should move in and out of combat to maximize their Slam feature.

If they have three or fewer charges:
* Stay in melee if winning the fight.
* Otherwise, flee, especially if carrying a rider who would be vulnerable.

> &#8226; Its movement speed increases by 10 ft.  
> &#8226; It gains a +1 bonus to Strength and Dexterity saving throws and checks.  
>
> If it has 0 charges, the steed is Incapacitated. 
>
> At the end of its turn, if the steed moved or took an action, roll 1d6 (or 2d6, keeping the lower result, it is Bloodied) to determine how many charges it loses:  
> - **6:** No charges lost  
> - **5–2:** Lose 1 charge  
> - **1:** Lose 2 charges 
>
> Another creature within 5 feet can attempt to crank the clockwork steed by using an action to make a *Strength Check:* DC 10.  
> - *Success:* The steed regains 1 charge.  
> - *Success by 5+:* The steed regains 1 additional charge per 5 over the DC (to a maximum of 6 total).
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +(2 + charges) to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d10) Bludgeoning damage per charge the steed has.  
> If the steed moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 10 + the number of charges the steed has.  
> *Failure:* The target is knocked Prone.
