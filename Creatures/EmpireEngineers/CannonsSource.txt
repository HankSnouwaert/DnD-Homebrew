## Cannons
Cannons are the most abundant war machines among Imperial armies across the world. During the heat of battle, crews hastily reload and prepare the weapon to send iron projectiles streaking across the battlefield. A single shot is able to carve through enemy formations, leaving a bloody trail of broken bodies as it effortlessly barrels through. Even mighty monstrosities such as giants and dragons have tumbled to the ground from a well-placed hit from such artillery.

### Hammer of Fiends
These are the cannons commissioned by the great churches of the Empire for their holy crusades. Such weapons are forged on sacred holidays, overseen by a small group of clergymen who chant sacred gospel during the creation process; the iron that forms the bulk of the cannon is cooled in holy water. The exterior of the weapon is gilded and inscribed with prayers that wrap along the length of its barrel. When such a blessed relic is taken to war, it becomes a physical manifestation of the gods’ wrath, capable of threatening even the greatest of demons. When fired, an effulgent streak of light shoots across the battlefield, annihilating all in a holy blaze. Malevolent entities powerful enough to survive such smiting feel the judgment of the heavens weighing down upon them, hindering their vile magics and leaving them feeble.

### Iron Stelae
The dangerous work of crewing cannons breeds superstition. It is not uncommon for gunners to adorn themselves with good-luck charms or perform strange rituals while loading ammunition and handling gunpowder. Some crews, however, have pushed these practices to an extreme that borders on religious devotion. They nearly deify the cannons themselves and even consort with wizards who have devoted their lives to wielding the magic of death. To most outsiders, such beliefs are insane, even blasphemous. These groups are shunned by polite society and tolerated in imperial armies only because of their unmatched skill and terrifying effectiveness.

The most mystifying of their rites occurs when an entire crew perishes in battle. Surviving members of the cult gather the bodies, the cannon, and whatever cannonballs remain on the field. They bear everything to a secluded location and begin constructing a solemn burial site. A crypt is dug for the fallen, the cannon enshrined at its very heart. Cannonballs recovered from the battlefield are painstakingly carved with eulogies and wedged into niches cut into the chamber walls.

Such sepulchral memorials are scattered in hidden places across the land. Stranger still, when a new crew is initiated into this grim brotherhood, they seek out one of these tombs, exhume the ancient cannon, pry the inscribed cannonballs from the walls, and march once more to war.
Cannons raised from these grave sites, known as Iron Stelae, are feared and haunted things. Their shots defy all reason: the balls shift mid-flight as if guided by invisible, vengeful hands, curving impossibly to slam into foes they should have missed entirely. Some of these weapons have been handed down through generations of gunners. Each crew that inherits one knows the solemn pact: when their own time comes, they too must be interred in the same tomb from which the cannon was first taken. Some of the most archaic sites now contain the bones of dozens of different crews that have accumulated over the centuries. To break this cycle and fail to return both gun and gunners to the earth is to watch the weapon lose its deadly enchantment forever.

###  Canon Tactics
Cannon crews will load cannonballs when foes are at a greater distance, targeting large groups of enemies or structures. The cannon crew should be guarded by other capable melee allies. If the enemy is fast approaching and there are no allies to stop their advance, they will switch to using grapeshot.


#### Hammer of Fiends Tactics
A hammer of fiends will always focus on spellcasters first, attempting to Chastise them. Otherwise, it will target Fiends and Undead.

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

\columnbreak

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.
