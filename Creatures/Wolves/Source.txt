# Wolves
These majestic and deadly hunters roam many of the world's forests and tundras, using their brutally effective pack-hunting tactics to fell much larger and more dangerous animals and strike fear in the hearts of humanoids who venture too far into the wilds. The sounds of distant howling will alert travelers that they are entering wolf territory, and few do so willingly unless traveling in a well-armed group.

***Master Pack Hunters.*** 
Should they become the wolves' prey, the travelers will be offered no additional warnings, as the pack will silently stalk the travelers, slowly closing in until they are noticed. Once the pack is spotted, it will close in and attempt to drive its prey into fleeing. Sufficiently powerful prey that stands its ground and proves intimidating enough may be able to drive the wolves away. Wolves that press the attack will attempt to separate the weakest-looking target from its companions and drag it to the ground, where it can be subdued with vicious bites.

***Fiercely Loyal Allies.*** The group dynamics and hunting strategies of wolves are similar enough to most humanoids that they are often able to integrate themselves into tribes living far from civilization. These wolves might live amongst druidic circles, barbarian tribes to the north, orcish warbands, or goblinoid warrens. Regardless of the group, the wolf's instinct toward teamwork and loyalty to hierarchical packs leaves it well suited to many vital roles. Wolves will serve their adopted families as sentries, hunters, and war beasts in combat. They are adept at following verbal and somatic instructions from their humanoid companions to coordinate their efforts.

***Dire Wolves.*** These primeval wolves are a more primitive and savage version of their modern kin. They are more often found in wilder regions that have remained untouched by civilization. Here, they prey on large game as well as any humanoids attempting to eke out an existence in the unforgiving wilds. Like ordinary wolves, dire wolves are prized allies amongst any humanoids able to humanoids able to tame or befriend them, though this is a difficult and dangerous prospect for any without druidic abilities. As dire wolves are often favored by gods of winter or the hunt, they may also be sent to aid those who curry the favor of such gods. Though, just are just as likely to be sent to hunt and devour those who displease the gods by daring to challenge the might of the wilds.

### Ascendant Packleader


Wolves blend ferocity, beauty, and teamwork in such a way that many humanoids regard them with a sense of awe that borders on reverence. As such, they are a favored animal among many celestial beings and a common form for sacred beasts to assume. Ascendant packleaders are a form of divine wolf created to lead wolf packs on the Material Plane in service of a higher purpose. They may have once been ordinary wolves elevated to divine status or celestials who took on a lupine form when they entered the Material Plane. 

Once an ascendant packleader has taken command of a wolf pack, it leads its lupine brethren with supernatural efficiency. Packleaders can bark orders at their pack mates, enabling them to perform complex tactical maneuvers normally beyond the capabilities of such creatures, and their supernatural howls can break the resolve of prey while driving their allies to victory. 

Using these powers of command, the ascendant packleader also drives its pack to pursue higher-level goals normally beyond the comprehension of ordinary wolves. These goals may simply be to protect a sacred wood, or they may involve furthering large-scale agendas in service of a god or other divine being. The nature of these goals and the packleaders pursuing them are as varied as the gods they serve. Noble packleaders act in service to gods seeking to protect the sanctity of life and nature, while brutal packleaders sent by wicked gods of the wilds take cruel pleasure in hunting humanoids and undoing the works of civilization.

They must all use the same option, which the packleader chooses. Each other creature within 120 feet of the packleader must then succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the packleader. The creature doesnâ€™t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

>
> &#8226; It makes one melee weapon attack or unarmed strike. If the attack has advantage from at least two sources, and one of them is due to the target being prone, the attack deals an extra 7(2d6) damage.
>
> &#8226; If the creature is suffering an effect that requires it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its next turn, it immediately makes that save.

## Werewolves
These savage predators are the most common and notorious of all lycanthropes. By day, they are aggressive and hot-tempered humanoids with a penchant for rare meat and an affinity for canines. When their tranformation takes place, they either turn into large, bloodthirsty wolves or terrifying wolf-human hybrids, with lupine heads and fur on a vaguely bipedal humanoid body complete with long arms and slashing claws. Though their paw-hands in this form are capable of manipulating objects and wielding weapons, werewolves much prefer slashing apart their prey with their iron-hard claws.



***Ravagers of Civilization.***
Most who contract werewolf lycanthropy withdraw from civilization. Even those who embrace their curse and care nothing for the harm they cause know they can't maintain their guise among other humanoids for long because, when a werewolf's transformation occurs, it becomes the anathema of all things civilized. The veneer of principles and rationality melt away, and primal instincts take over. The overriding emotion werewolves often feel is rage towards the civilized society that keeps them chained beneath the surface for the majority of their life. As such, werewolves often prioritize hunting other humanoids as a way of exacting their vengeance on the shackles of civilization. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some humanoids embrace this hatred and actively seek to tear down civilization even when in their humanoid form. Others fight against it, trying to maintain their guise of civility, which only serves to fuel the fury of the wolf within. Others find a way to make peace with their inner beast, and while still savage at heart, they are able to channel their ferocity in a way that minimizes harm to other innocent sentient creatures.

***Pack Hunters and Lone Wolves.*** The wolf's tendency to run in packs carries over to werewolves, who often form hunting groups in the wild to better catch particularly dangerous or evasive prey. These werewolf packs utilize many of the same techniques as wolves: silently stalking prey, launching ambushes designed to frighten their victims into fleeing, and isolating targets for coordinated takedowns. These hunts are usually led by a powerful pack leader who picks out the target and coordinates the werewolves' attacks against that victim, ensuring a bloody kill. 

Other werewolves live a more solitary life, shunning the company of their kind. This might be done out of rejection of their curse, because they don't wish to share their kills, or because they work with other non-lupine creatures. Though this isolation helps lone werewolves become more dangerous in isolation than those accustomed to working with a pack, they lack the ability to utilize the pack tactics of their more sociable kin.

### Werewolf Moon Mystics

All werewolves feel a primal connection to the moon and the urge to unleash their bestial impulses follows its phases. Some introspective werewolves study and meditate upon this connection, plumbing the depths of their primal psyche and how it intertwines with the moon's phases. This path not only helps these werewolves to better temper and regulate their reckless bloodthirst, but allows them to channel lunar power through their body. 

These werewolves come to be known as moon mystics, and they are known for the serene grace with which they take on their lupine aspect and are even better known for their ability to dispatch foes with magical blasts of moonlight. The restraint moon mystics are capable of allows them to avoid diving right into the fray and target dangerous foes from a distance with their lunar bolts and burning moonbeams. 

The ascetic nature of these werewolves means they rarely participate in hunts with others of their kind and often live as contemplative hermits. However, when moon mystics do join or interact with werewolf packs, they often serve as spiritual leaders. Some mystics temper the aggression of their kin, but others will warp the social dynamic of their pack, giving it a cult-like dynamic as they lead disturbing rituals designed to pursue inscrutable goals.

While illuminated this way, the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack roll against an affected target has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected target can't benefit from being invisible.
>
> ***Searing Moon Light. (1/Day)*** A pale beam of moonlight appears and fills a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 120 of the werewolf. The cylinder lasts as long as the werewolf maintains concentration on it, up to a minute (as if concentrating on a spell). The area of the cylinder is considered dimly lit. Any non-shapechanger that is caught in the area of the moonbeam when it first appears or that ends its turn within the moonbeam must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. It takes 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While maintaining concentration on this ability, the werewolf can use its bonus action to move the beam 30 feet in any direction.

> ***Shapechanger.*** The werewolf polymorphs into wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
>
> ***Hunters Howl (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest):***  The werewolf emits a howl that terrifies prey and rallies its pack. Each ally within 120 feet of it that can hear can take the Dash as a bonus action until the end of its next turn. Each other creature within 120 feet of the werewolf must then succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the werewolf. The creature doesnâ€™t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
