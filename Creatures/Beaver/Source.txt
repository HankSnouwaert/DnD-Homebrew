# Beavers
These small, semi-aquatic mammals appear cute and unassuming, but no other animal is capable of producing such dramatic changes on its river environment.  Though they only reach 2 feet in height, these plump creatures weigh up to 66 pounds, allowing them to out girth most halflings.  Their heavy build and webbed limbs make beavers comically awkward on land, but they are well adapted to spending most of their time in fresh water, even through cold winters.

**Industrious Masons.** Among the most iconic characteristics of the beaver is its massive set of teeth, which it uses for its most iconic activity: gnawing down trees to build its river dam home.  A beaver can fell a tree half a foot wide within an hour, and bring down even larger trees if given enough time.  The beaver’s stalky and muscular frame allows it to lift and drag heavier loads than its size would indicate, and the industrious creature can quickly amass large quantities of lumber at the site of its new home.

Using a combination of gnawed wood, stones, and hard mud, beavers create dams capable of housing large families.  These dams can be modest 10 foot long structures or massive feats of engineering reaching over 300 feet long. The dams are quite resilient and can only be entered via underwater tunnels.  Beavers are also quite diligent about repairing and maintaining their homes, using their keen hearing to detect leaks in need of patching.

&nbsp; &nbsp; **Ecosystem Engineers.** Besides humanoids, no creature does more to shape its environment than the beaver.  The dams beavers create can alter the paths of rivers, reshape lakes, and create new ponds.  These effects are often a boon for their home ecosystems, but beavers can also be a bane upon environments that aren’t suited to their deforesting and river altering tendencies.  Beaver dams can also result in the sudden flooding of humanoid settlements.

**Giant Beavers.** These enormous creatures can reach lengths of over 7 feet and weigh in at anywhere between 200 and 300 pounds.  Though giant beavers are the primeval cousins of the modern beaver, they are not known to bring down trees and build dams, instead feeding off of fresh water plants.  As such, they lack the intelligence needed for complex engineering and the flat tail useful for padding down the dam materials during construction, instead sporting a longer rat-like tail.  However, they still possess impressive aquatic abilities and their increased bulk and massive teeth makes them a much more formidable threat in a confrontation.  

<br>

> ##### Beaver Dams
> A beaver damn is a wooden structure with an AC 16, and it can range in size from large to gargantuan.  Each large section has 27 (5d10) hit points.

## Fester Gnaw

These horrible fiends revel in twisting and destroying ecosystems through deforestation and the blocking critical waterways.  Though they appear to be monstrously oversized beavers, they are demonic in nature.  Their slavering jaws contain massive teeth capable of cutting through trees and bones with equal ease, their bodies are covered in bony spines which serve as both armor and a means of attack, and their eyes gleam with a malevolent intelligence.

**River Desecration.** Groups of fester gnaws may arise as the result of beavers being exposed to abyssal energies or warped by demon lords, or they may claw their way to the mortal plane straight from the Abyss.  When they arrive on the mortal plane, their destructiveness is not as immediately obvious as that of other demons, but in many ways, it is far more insidious.  Fester gnaws will quickly find woodland towns near sources of fresh water and begin ravaging the land nearby, cutting down trees and desecrating the forest upstream from the unwitting humanoid settlements.  Once they have harvested enough lumber, they will construct a log dam which they can use to block and redirect the river, or worse, befoul its waters, causing it to carry corruption and sickness downstream.

**Terror of Druids.** Fester gnaws are quite adapt at overcoming druid conclaves and the many creatures that work with them.  Demonic cultists seeking to destroy druidic guardians and defile their homelands will often summon fester gnaws to snuff out these enemies, ensuring they will no longer pose a threat to their grander schemes.

**Festering Wounds.**  The fester gnaw's teeth drip with fiendish corruption.  When they bite through trees, they inflict the wood with this corruption which in turn spreads the taint into the waters that rush past their dams.  When fester gnaws bite other creatures, they can apply this corruption to their victims directly, inflicting them with festering wounds.  Festering wounds quickly rot a creature from the inside, and creatures suffering from multiple wounds succumb at an accelerated rate.  

\columnbreak

Creatures who lack heartiness or immediate medical attention quickly dissolve into gooey, rotten remains as they succumb to the fester gnaw’s corruption.

**Foul Damnation.** Fester gnaw dams are structures of horrendous evil.  They are comprised of the corrupted  wood they’ve harvest from the surrounding area as well as the bodies and bones of any creatures that attempted to interfere with the dam’s construction. At the dam's center is a demonic altar serving as the focus of the fester gnaws’ corruption.  The most potent of these altars are constructed using the remains of a treant or similar sacred forest creature.  These alters can spring to life to defend the dam if it is under attack, and their destruction is required to put an end to the dam for good.

#### Regional Effects
Fester Gnaws that manage to successfully construct a dam with an altar, corrupt any water that flows through the dam.  The waters remain corrupted for one day or until they flow 10 miles away from the dam:

* The water keeps creatures from properly healing and causes them to become more susceptible to sickness. Any creature that is not undead or a demon and is submerged in the water has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws, medicine checks used on it have disadvantage, and if it receives healing it only regains half the hit points it normally would.

* Creatures that are not undead or demons that consume the water must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased. Every 24 hours that elapse while diseased, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 3 (1d6) on a failure, and curing the disease on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.  If a creature succeeds on a saving throw against the disease it is immune to its effects for the next 24 hours.

#### Lair Actions
When fighting inside their dams, any fester gnaw can invoke its ambient magic to take lair actions.  Only one fester gnaw can take a lair action per round. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any fester gnaw can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects: 

* Corrupted wooden spikes spring up to fill a 5-foot cube within 60 feet of the fester gnaw.  Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the area is difficult terrain.  During this time, creatures that enter the area for the first time or start their turn their take 3d4 piercing damage, and if the creature is not a demon, it gains a festering wound (see the Fester Gnaw stat block).

* Demonic energy spews out from a creature afflicted with festering wounds.  A creature within 60 feet of the fester gnaw takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage for each festering wound it is suffering from.

<br>

* A wooden, log, wall sprouts at a point within the dam.  The wall is made up of a wooden 20-foot by 10-foot panel that is 6 inches thick. It has an AC 12, 20 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage.  If the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (the fester gnaw chooses).

A creature can have multiple instances of festering wound afflicting it at once.

Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of all such festering wounds afflicting it on a success.  A creature that dies as a result of damage from a festering wound dissolves into a pile of rotting goo.
