# Jaguars
These fearsome, bone-crushing <br> felines are the undisputed kings of <br> their many domains.  Reaching lengths <br> of 6 feet and weighing little more than 200 pounds, they are not the largest cats; but they can bring down animals much larger than themselves with their crushing bite.  They are ambush masters, and given the element of surprise, a single jaguar can hunt down a creature as large as an adult bull.  A jaguar that ambushes a group of travelers can easily crush the life out of the frailest member of their party and drag the fresh kill away before the rest of the group even has the chance to react.

**Sovereign of Many Domains.**  Most creatures are adapted for a specific type of terrain where they perform optimally.   Jaguars know no such limitations and are the apex predators of the many environments they can traverse.

In their jungle homes, they will stalk the terrestrial undergrowth for tapirs, swim through rivers to hunt caiman, and climb through trees looking for their next, unfortunate meal.  They are even comfortable leaving the jungle for open terrain, where they will hunt large cattle with impunity.  A wandering jaguar can quickly become the bane of a humanoid settlement, stalking its livestock and terrorizing its inhabitants.

&nbsp;  **Bone Crushers.**  While tigers are the largest felines, the jaguar possesses the greatest bite force for its size and can shatter dense bone.  Whereas most cats attack the neck to crush the throat and asphyxiate their prey, jaguars simply bite through the spinal column or even the skull of their victims.  Very little can withstand the crushing bite of a jaguar, and they can even shatter large turtle shells within their jaws.      

**Giant Jaguars.**  These primeval beasts are the larger ancestors of modern jaguars.  Adapted to hunting megafauna, giant jaguars stalk environments where their large prey is plentiful.  They count even the largest and most fearsome of beasts as their prey, and most humanoids they find are little more than helpless snacks.

**Sacred Predators.**  Cultures that develop in or near the jaguar's domain often come to revere and associate them with one or more of their gods.  Druids and other powerful beings living near jaguars will also call upon them as powerful guardians.  In both cases, should intruders offend the local deities or druids, jaguars, or even giant jaguars, may be called to meet out divine punishment to the offenders.

> ##### Panthers
> Some jaguars are born with black coats.  Referred to as panthers, these cats are more suited to sneaking through darker environments.  You can represent this by changing their Mask of the Jungle ability to function in areas of dim light rather than foliage.
