### Bray Shaman Tactics

Bray shamans serve as the primary spellcasters of the beastmen war herds. Unlike most other spellcasters, they are fairly durable and can engage in melee combat while using their spells. With their Primal Fury active, bray shamans can cast spells while also making attacks. This makes them formidable foes as they don't suffer the vulnerabilities of most spellcasters and won't hesitate to dive into melee combat.

The following tactics assume the bray shaman is accompanied by at least two other beastmen.

The lore of magic a bray shaman is specialized in significantly influences its combat tactics. Below are tactics specific to the different lores and their spells:

#### Lore of Beasts

NOTE: The Wild Heart trait doesn't support beasts

These bray shamans primarily serve a support role, which is helped by the fact that their Wild Heart trait works with most beastmen creatures.

##### Lore of Beasts Spells

**Pass Without Trace:** This ideally cast before combat begins. However, if allies can hide as a bonus action during combat, this spell remains useful during the fight.

**Amber Spear:** This should be cast when there's an opportunity to hit two or more targets.

**Aspect of the Beast:** This is typically cast on the shaman's most powerful ally. Ripping Jaws is generally the most useful for the Beastmen. With it, a beastman can use its Charge ability to topple a target and then bite with a higher chance of success. Additionally, the extra piercing damage from Primal Fury boosts the temporary hit points gained from the Ripping Jaws attack.

**Heroism:** This spell can be useful for either other beastmen or the shaman. It ensures the target isn't easily frightened, helping to mainain their Primal Fury. 

It's important to remember that this spell only benefits from the Wild Heart trait when cast at 1st level. For higher-level shamans, this often becomes their primary concentration spell.

**Monstrous Transformation:** This spell acts as a reset for the shaman. Upon transformation, the likelihood of reverting to their original form during combat is minimal. This spell is generally activated when the shaman's health drops below half or when it loses Primal Fury. While the transformed creature can't cast spells, any prior ongoing spells persist. 

Depending on the situation, the shaman might transform into a:

* **Manticore.** Preferable when adversaries have limited ranged capabilities

* **Hydra.** Chosen when foes have a lower damage output or can't focus their attacks on the transformed shaman

* **Dragon.** Optimal when opponents are grouped together, allowing the dragon's breath to hit multiple targets or when facing adversaries with high elemental damage output.

\columnbreak

#### Lore of Shadows
The Shadow Paths trait of this lore works well when combined with Beastmen who have the Charge ability. By swapping places with units like bestigors or wargors, the shaman can help them get in repeated charges during a fight.

##### Lore of Shadows Spells
**Pit of Shadows:** This spell is used at the earliest opportunity when it can affect two or more targets.

**Mystifying Miasma:** This is the shaman's go-to opening spell, unless *it of shadows* is available. It's used to disperse tightly packed enemy formations.

**Penumbral Pendulum:** This is employed when it can strike two or more foes. After casting it, the shaman's allies may attempt to grapple and restrain adversaries, ensuring they remain within the pendulum's path.

**Unseen Lurker:** This spell generally targets the shaman's strongest ally and is cast when no other spells take precedence or if the shaman requires an urgent retreat.

**Shroud of Dusk:** This spell is particularly handy during close-quarters combat. If the bray shaman knows it will have disadvantage on its next attack, this spell's darkness can level the playing field by canceling out any sources of advantage and disadvantage for most creatures in its area.

#### Lore of Death

Bray shamans practicing the Lore of Death tend to reserve their more potent spells for later rounds of combat, capitalizing on the enhanced power derived from their Leech Life ability.

##### Lore of Death Spells

**Circle of Death:** Given its vast area of effect, shamans prefer to cast this spell prior to engaging in melee combat, ensuring maximum enemy exposure.

**Aspect of Dread:** This spell is typically used after the shaman engages in melee combat. After charging in and making a Gore attack, the shaman will cast this spell while surrounded by foes to sow fear.

**Impending Doom:** This spell should target formidable enemy frontline fighters. This will help other beastmen knock them over with charging attacks.

**Inflict Wounds:** Shamans are patient with this spell, waiting for an opportune moment to strike a target when they have advantage.

**Crippling Pain:** This is best cast on agile skirmishers like monks or rogues. Its potency is amplified when targeting a prone adversary, as the act of standing further exacerbates the damage the target takes.

\pagebreakNum

#### Lore of the Wild
Bray shamans dedicated to this lore tend to be less melee-focused, especially those with access to the Savage Domain spell. The majority of their spells require concentration, and a significant portion are good at disrupting opponents' concentration.

##### Lore of the Wild Spells

**Savage Domain:** This spell is cast pre-combat unless doing so would jeopardize a surprise attack. While maintaining concentration on this spell, the shaman keeps its distance, remaining within 60 feet of the summoned monster. The type of summoned creature is typically random unless the shaman possesses prior knowledge about adversaries.

The choices are:

* **Giant:** Chosen if adversaries are adept at avoiding melee or are fighting at a distance

* **Jabberwocky:** Chosen when the objective is to hamper foes with the creature's Burble and other debilitating effects. (Remember that the Burble ability is indiscriminate, potentially affecting even the shaman if it gets too close.)

* **Behemoth:** A versatile monster, adept at singling out and consuming targets, as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

**Mad Rampage:** This should be cast on a unit with multiple attacks. Great Shamans might cast it on the creature summoned with *savage domain*.

**Vile Tide:** This should be used when it can target two or more opponents or disrupt a spell-concentrating foe, especially if *devolve* has already been used on them.

**Bray Scream:** This should be reserved for critical moments. It's typically cast on the shaman itself or on powerful allies like a Wargor or a creature summoned by *savage domain*. It's most effective when the targeted unit is at half-health and can affect at least two foes with the scream.

**NOTE: Nothing about Devolve?**

### Bray Shaman Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Gor Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
