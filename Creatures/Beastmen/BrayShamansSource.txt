## Bray Shamans


Beastman bray shamans occupy a <br> mystical and revered position within the <br> beastmen society, serving as the conduit between <br> the physical world and the dark, chaotic realms of their deities. Adorned with gnarled staves and a collection of arcane charms, icons, and fetishes - many of which are intricately woven into their fur - bray shamans present an eerie and formidable presence. 

As the primary spellcasters among the beastmen, bray shamans bear the responsibility of divining the will of their dark gods. They are deeply attuned to the chaotic energies that permeate their lands and use this connection to interpret signs and omens. This role places them at the center of the beastmen's ceremonies, often leading dark rituals that range from desecrating the forests to performing blood sacrifices of captives. These ceremonies are crucial in calling forth the herds from the depths of the forest, rallying them for war, or appeasing their savage gods.

The bray shamans are also the custodians of the sacred monoliths scattered throughout the forest. These ancient stones serve as focal points for the beastmen's mystical energies and are the sites of many of their most significant rituals. The power emanating from these monoliths is harnessed by the shamans to conduct powerful rites, strengthen their connection to the dark gods, and imbue their followers with otherworldly might.

In the hierarchical society of the beastmen, bray shamans often act as advisors and guides to chieftains and other leaders. Their insights are considered invaluable, ensuring that the strategies and plans of the herd align with the perceived desires of their gods. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This role imbues them with considerable influence, often placing them at the right hand of the most powerful leaders. They are among the only beastmen that need not fear attacks or challenges from others of their kind, for none would dare to harm a conduit of the gods.

Bray Shamans in beastmen society exhibit an array of magical abilities, each specializing in different arcane lores that reflect their connection to the natural and supernatural realms. Those attuned to the Lore of the Wilds channel the raw, malevolent forces of nature, manipulating the elements to unleash devastating spells that work to undo civility in all its forms. Shamans versed in the Lore of Beasts have a deep affinity with animals, able to summon and control various creatures or bestow their herds with beast-like ferocity and strength. The practitioners of the Lore of Death delve into the morbid and necrotic, wielding spells that sap life, summon spirits, and spread decay, embodying the finality of all life. Lastly, those who master the Lore of Shadows are adept in manipulation and illusion, using their magic to cloak their movements, sow confusion among enemies, and strike from where they are least expected. Each shaman's lore not only defines their role within their herd but also reflects their personal connection to the primeval forces that pervade their world.

Bray shamans within beastmen society vary in power, from lesser shamans associated with small herds to great shamans who counsel the most powerful leaders. Lesser shamans focus on minor rituals and guidance for smaller groups, honing their skills and gaining knowledge as they aspire to greater influence. In contrast, great shamans, at the pinnacle of this hierarchy, possess profound connections to the dark gods. They play crucial roles in strategic decisions, oversee major rituals, and channel significantly more potent magic.  These revered shamans are integral to the planning of large-scale operations, with their insights viewed as divine mandates, commanding deep respect and fear from their kin.

In battle, bray shamans are formidable opponents, using their dark magic to both bolster their allies and wreak havoc upon their enemies. Their spellcasting is instinctual and deeply entwined with the primal fury of their race. Drawing on the raw energies of their primeval homes and the chaotic power of their gods, they can unleash devastating spells, sow confusion among enemy ranks, and invigorate their beastmen brethren. This combination of mystical prowess and savage instinct makes the bray shamans a fearsome force, embodying the untamed and unpredictable essence of the malevolent wilds.

### Bray Shaman Tactics

Bray shamans serve as the primary spellcasters of the beastmen war herds. Unlike most other spellcasters, they are fairly durable and can engage in melee combat while using their spells. With their Primal Fury active, bray shamans can cast spells while also making attacks. This makes them formidable foes as they don't suffer the vulnerabilities of most spellcasters and won't hesitate to dive into melee combat.

The following tactics assume the bray shaman is accompanied by at least two other beastmen.

The lore of magic a bray shaman is specialized in significantly influences its combat tactics. Below are tactics specific to the different lores and their spells:

#### Lore of Beasts

These bray shamans primarily serve a support role, which is helped by the fact that their Wild Heart trait works with most beastmen creatures.

##### Lore of Beasts Spells

**Pass Without Trace:** This ideally cast before combat begins. However, if allies can hide as a bonus action during combat, this spell remains useful during the fight.

**Amber Spear:** This should be cast when there's an opportunity to hit two or more targets.

**Aspect of the Beast:** This is typically cast on the shaman's most powerful ally. Ripping Jaws is generally the most useful for the Beastmen. With it, a beastman can use its Charge ability to topple a target and then bite with a higher chance of success. Additionally, the extra piercing damage from Primal Fury boosts the temporary hit points gained from the Ripping Jaws attack.

**Heroism:** This spell can be useful for either other beastmen or the shaman. It ensures the target isn't easily frightened, helping to mainain their Primal Fury. 

It's important to remember that this spell only benefits from the Wild Heart trait when cast at 1st level. For higher-level shamans, this often becomes their primary concentration spell.

**Monstrous Transformation:** This spell acts as a reset for the shaman. Upon transformation, the likelihood of reverting to their original form during combat is minimal. This spell is generally activated when the shaman's health drops below half or when it loses Primal Fury. While the transformed creature can't cast spells, any prior ongoing spells persist. 

Depending on the situation, the shaman might transform into a:

* **Manticore.** Preferable when adversaries have limited ranged capabilities

* **Hydra.** Chosen when foes have a lower damage output or can't focus their attacks on the transformed shaman

* **Dragon.** Optimal when opponents are grouped together, allowing the dragon's breath to hit multiple targets or when facing adversaries with high elemental damage output.

#### Lore of Shadows
The Shadow Paths trait of this lore works well when combined with beastmen who have the Charge ability. By swapping places with units like besthorns or warhorns, the shaman can help them get in repeated charges during a fight.

##### Lore of Shadows Spells
**Pit of Shadows:** This spell is used at the earliest opportunity when it can affect two or more targets.

**Mystifying Miasma:** This is the shaman's go-to opening spell, unless *Pit of shadows* is available. It's used to disperse tightly packed enemy formations.

**Penumbral Pendulum:** This is employed when it can strike two or more foes. After casting it, the shaman's allies may attempt to grapple and restrain adversaries, ensuring they remain within the pendulum's path.

**Unseen Lurker:** This spell generally targets the shaman's strongest ally and is cast when no other spells take precedence or if the shaman requires an urgent retreat.

**Shroud of Dusk:** This spell is particularly handy during close-quarters combat. If the bray shaman knows it will have disadvantage on its next attack, this spell's darkness can level the playing field by canceling out any sources of advantage and disadvantage for most creatures in its area.

#### Lore of Death

Bray shamans practicing the Lore of Death tend to reserve their more potent spells for later rounds of combat, capitalizing on the enhanced power derived from their Leech Life ability.

##### Lore of Death Spells

**Circle of Death:** Given its vast area of effect, shamans prefer to cast this spell prior to engaging in melee combat, ensuring maximum enemy exposure.



**Aspect of Dread:** This spell is typically used after the shaman engages in melee combat. After charging in and making a Gore attack, the shaman will cast this spell while surrounded by foes to sow fear.



**Impending Doom:** This spell should target formidable enemy frontline fighters. This will help other beastmen knock them over with charging attacks.

**Inflict Wounds:** Shamans are patient with this spell, waiting for an opportune moment to strike a target when they have advantage.

**Crippling Pain:** This is best cast on agile skirmishers like monks or rogues. Its potency is amplified when targeting a prone adversary, as the act of standing further exacerbates the damage the target takes.


#### Lore of The Wild
Bray shamans dedicated to this lore tend to be less melee-focused, especially those with access to the Savage Domain spell. The majority of their spells require concentration, but their Bestial Surge trait allows them to maintain multiple spells at once, and they will often have at least one spell going that can help them disrupt the concentration of enemy spellcasters.

##### Lore of the Wild Spells

**Savage Dominion:** This spell is cast pre-combat unless doing so would jeopardize a surprise attack. While maintaining concentration on this spell, the shaman keeps its distance, remaining within 60 feet of the summoned monster. The type of summoned creature is typically random unless the shaman possesses prior knowledge about adversaries.

The choices are:

* **Giant:** Chosen if adversaries are adept at avoiding melee or are fighting at a distance

* **Jabberwocky:** Chosen when the objective is to hamper foes with the creature's Burble and other debilitating effects. (Remember that the Burble ability is indiscriminate, potentially affecting even the shaman if it gets too close.)

* **Behemoth:** A versatile monster, adept at singling out and consuming targets, as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

**Mad Rampage:** This should be cast on a unit with multiple attacks. Great Shamans might cast it on the creature summoned with *savage domain*.

**Vile Tide:** This should be used when it can target two or more opponents or disrupt a spell-concentrating foe, especially if *devolve* has already been used on them.

**Bray Scream:** This should be reserved for critical moments. It's typically cast on the shaman itself or on powerful allies like a warhorn or a creature summoned by *savage domain*. It's most effective when the targeted unit is at half-health and can affect at least two foes with the scream.

**Devolve:** This spell is saved for when the shaman can target an enemy spellcaster with it.

### Bray Shaman Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the <br> valuable goods that can be looted from them are <br> the remains of the equipment they were using or <br> valuables they were carrying, though it is common <br> to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped <br> valuables can be found using an **Intelligence <br> (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly  <br>using a flat modifier.


#### Bray Shaman Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items <br> and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results <br> of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting <br> or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## New Spells

#### Mystic Signal

*5th-level transmutation (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** self
- **Components:**  V, S, M (A focus worth at <br> least 500 gp, such as a war horn, marble <br> bird, or a gem encrusted jaw bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
___

This spell enables you to broadcast a brief message, no longer than four seconds in length, to each creature within 3 miles of your location. Recipients of the message hear it in their minds and, if they know you, recognize you as the sender. Additionally, they discern your distance and direction at the time of casting. The spell ensures that creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 1 can comprehend the message's meaning. 

A sleeping creature can hear the message and may choose to awaken upon hearing it.

You can tailor the spell to target specific types of creatures only, such as humans, giants, unicorns, etc.

The message cannot be received by any creature if there is any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocking a direct path between you and the creature.

### Lore of Beasts

#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

#### Aspect of the Beast

*4th-level  transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

\pagebreakNum

#### Monstrous Transformation

*6th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Until dispelled
- **Classes:**   Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found later in this document). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Ranger, Bard
___

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 


 This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You conjure a spectral pendulum that swings through a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, and 5-foot-tall line of your choice within range. Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot.

___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

The the line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:**  Ranger
___

Choose a willing creature you can see within range. The chosen creature becomes enveloped in a shroud of mist, enabling it to move with unseen swiftness. Until the start of your next turn, the creature's movement speed is doubled, it's quickened, and it becomes invisible along with everything it's wearing or carrying.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 3rd.

### Lore of The Wild

#### Devolve
*1st-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of lizard brain)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Druid, Sorcerer

You choose a creature you can see within range. It must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or be overwhelmed by the primal aspects of its psyche for the duration of the spell. Constructs and undead are immune to this effect. 

While affected, the creature:
* Has disadvantage on Intelligence and Charisma checks
* Cannot cast or concentrate on spells
* Cannot activate magic items
* Cannot speak or understand any language
* Is treated as a beast with an Intelligence score of 4 when targeted by spells and abilities that normally only target beasts, such as *dominate beast* or *beast bond* (This doesn't change its actual Intelligence score)

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Intelligence saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a 2nd-level spell slot, the affected creature takes 1d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its turns while under this spell's effects before it makes the saving throw. When cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 2nd.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:**  V, S, M (a stinger)
- **Duration:**  1 minute
- **Classes:**   Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You plunge a willing creature within range that you can see into a frenzied state, making it reckless and heedless of danger. 

For the duration of the spell:
* The creature incurs a −2 penalty to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
* The creature becomes quickened.
* When the creature hits with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, it deals an additional die of its damage. If the creature moves at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making the attack, the attack deals two additional dice of its damage, and it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.

If the creature is charmed or frightened, these effects are suspended for the duration of this spell.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A goat hair)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Bard
___

You or a willing creature of your choice within range is filled with primal vigor and releases a powerful howling roar in a 30-foot cone. If the target is prone, it can immediately stand up without using any movement. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

Additionally, the creature releasing the roar regains 3d8 hit points. Constructs and undead cannot regain hit points from this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the damage and healing increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Savage Dominion

*7th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Warlock
___

You call forth a formidable creature of your choice: a **Stone Hurling Giant**, a **Madding Jabberwocky**, or a **Hungering Behemoth**. It materializes in an unoccupied space within range and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

This primitive creature is allied with you and your companions. It acts on your initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. You can telepathically communicate with the creature while you are on the same plane, and you are both aware of each other's locations. It follows your telepathic commands without requiring an action from you. If not given any commands, it automatically moves toward and attacks the nearest creature it detects.

If the creature moves more than 100 feet from you, your concentration on the spell is broken. Additionally, at the start of its turn, if the creature has taken damage since its last turn, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn't disappear but becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and you lose control over it. The uncontrolled creature cannot be dismissed by you and will disappear 1 hour after it was summoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the summoned creature gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 7th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, the spell's duration extends to 8 hours.

#### Vile Tide
*2nd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M  (A few grains of sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of fat)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
___

You cause a swarm of insects to erupt from the ground within a 10-foot square area at a point you choose within range. Each creature standing in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 piercing damage, and insects burrow into the creature, remaining there for the spell's duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage, and the insects do not burrow into it. 

While the insects are burrowed in a creature, the creature has disadvantage on checks, cannot regain hit points, and takes 2d4 piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. 

Any creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the insects from a creature. This check must be done using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, and it causes 1d4 damage of its damage type to the target. On a successful check, all the insects are destroyed, and the spell ends for that creature. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the insects, but if it does, the target takes 3d4 damage instead. 

Alternatively, a creature can expend a use of a Healer's Kit or use the *lesser restoration* spell to purge the insects without needing to make a check.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the behemoth can't bite another target. If the target is a Large or smaller and already grappled by the behemoth, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behemoth, and it takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the behemoth's turns. If the behemoth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

On a failed save, a creature is hit by the thrown creature, takes 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it dodges out of the way, takes no damage, and is not knocked prone.
