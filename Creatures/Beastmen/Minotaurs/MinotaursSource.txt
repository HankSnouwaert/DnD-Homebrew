#### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

\columnbreak

#### New Condition: Wounds
While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:

 * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
 * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
 * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

\pagebreakNum

### Minotaur Tactics
#### Common Traits
* Formidable melee fighters.
* Lower health but higher damage output.
* Possess Blood Greed trait, increasing damage and appetite for flesh.
* After a kill, they may gorge on the prey rather than pursue other nearby enemies.

#### Minotaur Combat Style
* Favors a full gore attack, knocking targets back 10 feet.
* Typically backs up to charge again, unless blood greed is active.
* When blood greed is active, uses a greataxe or charges at an accessible enemy, risking opportunity attacks.

#### Minotaur Butcher:
* Higher defense than regular Minotaurs.
* Blood Greed activation enhances Hewing Cleaver attack and triggers Blood Regeneration for better survivability.

#### Gorebull
* Capable of making two attacks per turn; first a gore to knock a target prone, then a greataxe attack with advantage.
* Can charge at two different targets if able.
* While under the effects of Blood Greed, prefers two Hewing Greataxe attacks for increased damage.
* Uses Slaughterer’s Call before combat to rally minotaurs and gain tactical advantage.

#### Doombull
* Begins combat by charging to knock a target prone.
* Follows up with Barbed Fist to inflict wounds that can be exploited by fellow minotaurs.
* Coordinates attacks to keep the target prone, maximizing damage with Hewing Greataxe.
* Prioritizes reapplying wounds to maintain tactical advantage if the target recovers.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

# The Warherd
This section lists the different <br> types of beastmen along with <br> the savage monsters they <br> often utilize in battle. The <br> different types of beastmen <br> include the shorthorns, <br> longhorns, and besthorns. The <br> various horrific monsters they utilize can be <br> found living alongside the beastmen or lurking <br> the wilds of their dark forest homelands. 

### Managing Primal <br> Fury At Scale

Many beastmen have an ability known as Primal Fury, <br> which, when active, can force them to make a Wisdom <br> check at the end of their turn. If you're managing a lot <br> of beastmen in combat and prefer not to roll each of the Primal Fury checks individually each time they come up, <br> the following set of alternative rules can streamline this process.

#### Primal Fury <br> (Alternative Mass Combat Version) 
At the beginning of combat, all beastmen enter combat with their Primal Fury active. On initiative count 20 each turn (losing all initiative ties), roll a d20. If the roll is 11 or higher, the Primal Fury of all beastmen remains active; if it is less, the Primal Fury ends for all beastmen until the next initiative count 20. Add a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll for each beastman in the encounter that is neither charmed nor frightened. Subtract 1 from the roll for each beastman that has been reduced to 0 hit points since the last roll.

Specific abilities of some of the beastmen modify these rules as follows:

**Crown of Horns, Will of the Dark Gods, and Apocalyptic Vision.** If there is a beastman in the battle with one of these abilities, add a +5 bonus to the roll rather than providing advantage, as long as the beastman providing the ability is not charmed or frightened. If there are multiple beastmen with these abilities, the effects are cumulative.

## Beastmen Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them. You may apply these mutations to creatures who don't have the beastman creature type, but some of the effects may require the creature to have the Primal Fury, Blood Greed or Charge abilities.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Crown of Horns (Requires Primal Fury) (Note Reworded)
*This creature is gifted with especially large and grandiose twisting horns, granting it extreme confidence, for it knows it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

When the beastman makes a Wisdom check caused by its Primal Fury ability, it automatically succeeds unless it has disadvantage on the roll.

### Gnarled Hide

*The beastman's hide has toughed up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The beastman gets +2 to its AC.

### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Beastman's Gore attack deals extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage in addition to it's normal damage if it moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit. (Note Reworded)

### Many Limbed Monster

*The beastman sports an extra pair of clawed arms to tear at its enemies.*

When the beastman takes the attack action, it makes one additional attack as part of the action, which uses the attack modifier of its Gore attack. On hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage. (The attack also gains the benefits of Primal Fury and Blood Greed.)

### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury or Blood Greed ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. (Note Reworded)

### Shadow Hide

*The beastman's black fur melds perfectly with the darkness around it, allowing it to stalk its prey from the shadows while completely unseen.*

While in darkness, the beastman is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness. Additionally, it does not suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks from wearing Armor.
Finally, it gains the Bestial Ambush ability as described below. If it already has a Bestial Ambush ability, the damage bonus of its Bestial Ambush is increased by 9 (2d8).

***Bestial Ambush.*** When the beastman takes the Attack action for the first time each combat, its walking speed increases by 20 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If it hits with an attack during that turn that has advantage, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage.

> ##### Using Mutations To Create Urgency In Adventures
> If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with beastmen and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the beastmen in the adventure gain mutations as time passes. This means the more slowly and carefully the players progress, the more dangerous the beastmen will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. 
> 
> If you want the mutations to be random, you can roll a d8 to determine what mutation they will gain (number each of the abilities in alphabetical order).
>
> The rate at which they gain mutations could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.

### Slug-Skin

*This beastman's disgusting skin oozes thick, slippery, toxic slime.*

At the end of the beastman's turn, any ground within 5 feet of it is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Creatures standing in the area have disadvantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, and prone creatures in the area must spend all their movement to stand up instead of half. If a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. 

Beastman ignore the effects of the slime. A gallon or more of water moving more than 5 miles per hour will wash the slime away from a 5-foot square area.


### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

### Goregreed (Requires Blood Greed)

*The beastman hunger for flesh can not be stated, the more blood it tastes the greater it hunger*

When the beastman activates it's blood greed ability, it gets +2 to attack rolls, this ability can stack up to three times, it loses all stacks if it ends it's turn with out activating blood greed.
