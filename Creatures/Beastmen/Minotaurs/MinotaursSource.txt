## Minotaurs

Minotaurs are towering monstrosities among the beastmen, standing twice as tall as a man with bodies rippling with massive muscles and heads resembling those of fierce, fanged bulls. Their bull heads are equipped with sharp teeth, perfect for tearing at flesh and making them even more fearsome in close combat. Their sheer size and strength make them formidable foes on any battlefield, their presence alone often causing enemies to falter in fear. Though they possess immense physical power, minotaurs are known to be even less intelligent than their beastmen kin, relying on brute force and primal instincts rather than cunning or strategy.

In battle, minotaurs are driven by an insatiable hunger for flesh, with a particular preference for human flesh. This ravenous appetite fuels their ferocity, and once they taste blood, they are thrown into a wild frenzy. Their charges are devastating, capable of breaking through enemy lines and causing chaos and destruction. The sight of a blood-crazed minotaur rampaging through a battlefield is enough to turn the tide of combat in favor of the beastmen.

Minotaurs hold a special place in the dark pantheon of beastmen worship. They are often called upon by their dark gods to serve as guardians of sacred, unholy sites hidden deep underground or within the darkest parts of the woods. These sites are often maze-like, labyrinthine structures created through the twisted influence of the dark gods. Minotaurs navigate these unholy labyrinths with unnatural ease, hunting down intruders with relentless determination. 

Despite the fear they inspire, powerful beastmen leaders will summon minotaurs to join them in battle, luring them with promises of fresh meat and the chance to sate their bloodlust. Other beastmen tread carefully around these hulking brutes, aware of their unpredictable nature and the devastation they can unleash.


Minotaurs who frequently participate in the wars of the beastmen and have gorged on the flesh of countless enemies become more powerful and are referred to as Flesh Gorgers. These monstrous brutes grow even larger and more muscled, their already formidable strength becoming even more devastating. Their fanged bull heads become more menacing, with teeth stained from the blood of their countless victims. The insatiable hunger that drives them intensifies, turning them into relentless engines of destruction on the battlefield. Flesh Gorgers are feared by both enemies and their fellow beastmen, their bloodlust and ferocity making them nearly unstoppable forces of nature. Their presence in a battle often signals an impending massacre, as they tear through foes with terrifying ease, leaving carnage in their wake.

The Butchers are a notorious group of minotaurs, renowned for their unparalleled brutality and efficiency in combat. Each member of this dreaded band wields a massive meat cleaver, a weapon perfectly suited to their immense strength and savage nature. These cleavers are capable of hewing through flesh, bone, and armor with horrifying ease. When the Butchers charge into battle, their cleavers flash through the air, leaving a trail of blood and dismembered bodies in their wake. Their brutal fighting style and sheer ferocity ensure that few can stand against them for long.

Unlike other minotaurs driven by the immediate need to sate their hunger, the Butchers are known for slaughtering far more foes than they can devour at one time. Entire villages fall to their rampages, leaving behind a grisly tableau of carnage. The Butchers string up the remaining corpses, leaving them to rot as a grim warning to others and as a gruesome larder they can return to whenever they please. These horrific displays serve both as a deterrent to would-be challengers and as a testament to their savage dominance. The Butchers' reign of terror spreads fear far and wide, with their name becoming synonymous with relentless slaughter and unending horror. The sight of their macabre handiwork marks the territory of the Butchers, reminding all who see it of the monstrous appetites and barbaric cruelty that define these fearsome minotaurs.

#### Minotaur Commanders


Minotaur commanders, known as Warbulls, are seasoned veterans blessed by the dark gods, their strength and resilience elevated to supernatural levels. These commanders become engines of brutal destruction, their colossal forms and overwhelming power making them effective leaders despite their limited intelligence. The greatest among them, the Doombulls, are towering figures of unrelenting wrath and devastating might. Revered and feared, Doombulls inspire a frenzied bloodlust in their followers, driving them to fight with reckless abandon and brutal efficiency. Their formidable presence alone can turn the tide of battle, as their followers are emboldened by the sheer power and ferocity they witness.

Both Warbulls and Doombulls lead through raw power and presence, often commanding from the front lines where their followers can see their unmatched might firsthand. Their roars and bellows incite their beastmen hordes to unparalleled ferocity, turning warbands into unstoppable tides of destruction. While lacking in subtlety and strategic cunning, their straightforward approach of overwhelming force is brutally effective. The sight of a Doombull leading a charge signals the arrival of chaos and carnage on an unprecedented scale, striking fear into the hearts of even the most seasoned warriors. These commanders rely not on complex strategies but on their ability to inspire terror and bloodlust, ensuring that their armies fight with the same relentless savagery that defines them.

### Minotaur Tactics
#### Common Traits
* Formidable melee fighters.
* Lower health but higher damage output.
* Possess Blood Greed trait, increasing damage and appetite for flesh.
* After a kill, they may gorge on the prey rather than pursue other nearby enemies.

#### Minotaur Combat Style
* Favors a full gore attack, knocking targets back 10 feet.
* Typically backs up to charge again, unless blood greed is active.
* When blood greed is active, uses a greataxe or charges at an accessible enemy, risking opportunity attacks.

#### Minotaur Butcher:
* Higher defense than regular Minotaurs.
* Blood Greed activation enhances Hewing Cleaver attack and triggers Blood Regeneration for better survivability.

#### Gorebull
* Capable of making two attacks per turn; first a gore to knock a target prone, then a greataxe attack with advantage.
* Can charge at two different targets if able.
* While under the effects of Blood Greed, prefers two Hewing Greataxe attacks for increased damage.
* Uses Slaughterer’s Call before combat to rally minotaurs and gain tactical advantage.

#### Doombull
* Begins combat by charging to knock a target prone.
* Follows up with Barbed Fist to inflict wounds that can be exploited by fellow minotaurs.
* Coordinates attacks to keep the target prone, maximizing damage with Hewing Greataxe.
* Prioritizes reapplying wounds to maintain tactical advantage if the target recovers.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

# The Warherd
This section lists the different <br> types of beastmen along with <br> the savage monsters they <br> often utilize in battle. The <br> different types of beastmen <br> include the shorthorns, <br> longhorns, and besthorns. The <br> various horrific monsters they utilize can be <br> found living alongside the beastmen or lurking <br> the wilds of their dark forest homelands. 

### Managing Primal <br> Fury At Scale

Many beastmen have an ability known as Primal Fury, <br> which, when active, can force them to make a Wisdom <br> check at the end of their turn. If you're managing a lot <br> of beastmen in combat and prefer not to roll each of the Primal Fury checks individually each time they come up, <br> the following set of alternative rules can streamline this process.

#### Primal Fury <br> (Alternative Mass Combat Version) 
At the beginning of combat, all beastmen enter combat with their Primal Fury active. On initiative count 20 each turn (losing all initiative ties), roll a d20. If the roll is 11 or higher, the Primal Fury of all beastmen remains active; if it is less, the Primal Fury ends for all beastmen until the next initiative count 20. Add a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll for each beastman in the encounter that is neither charmed nor frightened. Subtract 1 from the roll for each beastman that has been reduced to 0 hit points since the last roll.

Specific abilities of some of the beastmen modify these rules as follows:

**Crown of Horns, Will of the Dark Gods, and Apocalyptic Vision.** If there is a beastman in the battle with one of these abilities, add a +5 bonus to the roll rather than providing advantage, as long as the beastman providing the ability is not charmed or frightened. If there are multiple beastmen with these abilities, the effects are cumulative.

## Beastmen Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them. You may apply these mutations to creatures who don't have the beastman creature type, but some of the effects may require the creature to have the Primal Fury, Blood Greed or Charge abilities.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Crown of Horns <br> (Requires Primal Fury) 
*This creature is gifted with especially large and grandiose twisting horns, granting it extreme confidence, for it knows it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

When the beastman makes a Wisdom check caused by its Primal Fury ability, it automatically succeeds unless it has disadvantage on the roll.

### Gnarled Hide

*The beastman's hide has toughed up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The beastman gets +2 to its AC.

### Goregreed (Requires Blood Greed)

*The beastman's hunger for flesh can not be stated; the more blood it tastes, the greater it hungers.*

When the beastman's Blood Greed trait activates, it gets +2 to attack rolls. This ability can stack up to three times. It loses all stacks if it ends its turn without activating Blood Greed.

### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Beastman's Gore attack deals extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage in addition to it's normal damage if it moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit.

### Many Limbed Monster

*The beastman sports an extra pair of clawed arms to tear at its enemies.*

When the beastman takes the attack action, it makes one additional attack as part of the action, which uses the attack modifier of its Gore attack. On hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage. (The attack also gains the benefits of Primal Fury and Blood Greed.)

### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury or Blood Greed ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Shadow Hide

*The beastman's black fur melds perfectly with the darkness around it, allowing it to stalk its prey from the shadows while completely unseen.*

While in darkness, the beastman is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness. Additionally, it does not suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks from wearing Armor.
Finally, it gains the Bestial Ambush ability as described below. If it already has a Bestial Ambush ability, the damage bonus of its Bestial Ambush is increased by 9 (2d8).

***Bestial Ambush.*** When the beastman takes the Attack action for the first time each combat, its walking speed increases by 20 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If it hits with an attack during that turn that has advantage, it deals an extra 9 (2d8) damage.

> ##### Using Mutations To Create Urgency In Adventures
> If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with beastmen and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the beastmen in the adventure gain mutations as time passes. This means the more slowly and carefully the players progress, the more dangerous the beastmen will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. 
> 
> If you want the mutations to be random, you can roll a d8 to determine what mutation they will gain (number each of the abilities in alphabetical order).
>
> The rate at which they gain mutations could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.

### Slug-Skin

*This beastman's disgusting skin oozes thick, slippery, toxic slime.*

At the end of the beastman's turn, any ground within 5 feet of it is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Creatures standing in the area have disadvantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, and prone creatures in the area must spend all their movement to stand up instead of half. If a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. 

Beastman ignore the effects of the slime. A gallon or more of water moving more than 5 miles per hour will wash the slime away from a 5-foot square area.


### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.
