## Stoneheart

Stoneheart was once a powerful warlord <br> commanding a formidable beastman tribe, known <br> for his brutal strength and unwavering dominance. His reign was challenged when a cunning bray speaker attempted to seize control of the tribe by possessing Stoneheart’s body, intending to use the mighty minotaur as a puppet to command the tribe. However, Stoneheart’s will proved to be extraordinarily powerful. In a remarkable feat of mental fortitude, he managed to wrest control of his body long enough to exact vengeance on the shaman’s physical form, which lay vulnerable and defenseless in a trance.

After Stoneheart destroyed the shaman's body, the shaman’s spirit became trapped within him. This left the two entities locked in a constant battle for control. When Stoneheart is in control, he behaves and fights like a typical minotaur doombull, exuding raw power and engaging in relentless, brutal combat. However, when the shaman’s spirit gains the upper hand, Stoneheart’s capabilities change dramatically. Under the shaman’s influence, he gains access to mystic powers, allowing him to wield dark magic and curses far beyond the reach of ordinary minotaurs.

This duality makes Stoneheart a fearsome and unpredictable foe. The shaman’s spirit grants him a level of cunning and strategic thinking that is unheard of among minotaurs, making him a dangerous opponent on and off the battlefield. However, the constant internal struggle between the two spirits also renders him prone to erratic and unpredictable behavior. Allies and enemies alike are never certain which aspect of Stoneheart they will face: the unyielding brute force of the doombull or the dark, cunning sorcery of the trapped shaman. This internal conflict drives Stoneheart’s actions, making him one of the most formidable and enigmatic figures among the beastmen.

### Epic Battle: Dual Souls

For an epic encounter with Stoneheart, give the Bray Speaker spirit possessing him its own pool of 310 hit points, which it regains after a short or long rest. 

Whenever Stoneheart takes damage while possessed, the damage is instead dealt to the Bray Speaker. If this damage reduces the Bray Speaker to 0 hit points, Stoneheart takes the remaining damage and loses the Possessed trait. Conversely, if Stoneheart is reduced to 0 hit points, the Bray Speaker takes the remaining damage. In this case, the Stoneheart automatically becomes possessed, losing the ability to make saving throws to end the possession.

Stoneheart only dies if both he and the Bray Speaker are reduced to 0 hit points.

For this encounter, increase Stoneheart's challenge rating (CR) to 22.

#### Not Possessed

### Stoneheart Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from minotaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.
