>
> ***Multiattack.*** The megataur makes two attacks with its Blade Arms. It can then use its Swallow or make two fist attacks.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 7) piercing damage.
>
> ***Blade Arm.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 7) slashing damage.
>
> ***Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d4 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 20). The megataur has two fists, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 32 (4d12 + 6) piercing damage. If the megataur moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 26 (4d12) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.
>
> ***Swallow.*** The megataur makes one bite attack against each Large or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the megataur. At the start of each of the megataur's turns, each swallowed creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage for each level of heat it has. The megataur regains 5 hit points for each creature damaged this way. A creature loses all stacks of heat once it is no longer restrained by the megataur. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by the fire damage, it dies, and its body is dissolved. The megataur dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regain hit points from this feature.
>
> If the megataur takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the megataur must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the megataur. If the megataur dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Rushing Gore.*** When the megataur takes the Dash action, it can make a Gore attack.

>
> **Blood Call.** The megataur chooses a creature that just took its turn, which it can see within 120 feet of it, calling it into battle by having the creature's own blood turn on it. At the start of the creature's next turn, the target may move on its turn toward the megataur by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet of it. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal, except it can't move away from the megataur willingly and can't teleport. If it doesn't choose to move this way, it takes 27 (5d10) force damage instead.
>
> **Check.** The megataur makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Lunging Grasp.** The megataur moves up to 25 feet and then may make a Fist attack against a creature that just took its turn.

> **Swallow.** The megataur uses the Swallow action.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If the megataur is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.

### Megatuar Tactics
#### Combat Initiation
* Use Rushing Gore to close distance when enemies are out of reach.
* Once in melee range, target the physically strongest creature for blade arm attacks.
* Simultaneously attempt to grasp and swallow nearby, physically weaker creatures.

#### Rejuvenation Strategy
* The megataur requires creatures in its stomach to activate rejuvenation.
* If its health falls to half or less and there are no enemy creatures in its stomach or nearby, start swallowing weaker allied creatures to heal.

### Megataur Loot
The valuable items looted from rat ogres will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Megataur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
