## Megataurs

Megataurs are colossal four-armed <br> monstrosities that tower over their <br> beastmen kin, feared and revered in equal <br> measure. These giant creatures are believed <br> to be former minotaurs who underwent extreme <br> mutations due to the overconsumption of tainted <br> flesh or other eldritch substances. This consumption <br> led to grotesque transformations, amplifying their already formidable strength and size, and giving them their terrifying new form.

Two of the megataur's arms end in massive, bone-like blades, perfect for cleaving through armor and flesh alike. The other two arms are used to grab and shovel as much flesh into their fanged maw as possible, feeding their insatiable hunger. Their monstrous form and ravenous appetite make them nearly uncontrollable, a fact that only the most powerful beastmen chieftains and shamans can overcome. Those who can control a megataur wield it as a living weapon of war, unleashing its fury upon their enemies.

In combat, megataurs are devastating forces of nature. They rush into masses of enemies with terrifying speed, bulldozing through ranks and causing chaos and panic. Their bladed arms swing with destructive force, while their other arms grab and swallow foes whole. The sight of a Megataur rampaging across the battlefield is enough to break the spirit of even the most stalwart defenders, leaving a trail of destruction and carnage in its wake. These beasts are not just instruments of war; they are the embodiment of the beastmen's endless hunger, unleashed upon the world in a frenzy of blood and violence.

***The Blood Brute.*** The Blood Brute is a particularly fearsome megataur, having received dark blessings from a demonic lord of war and bloodlust. These unholy gifts have intensified the creature's already insatiable hunger for flesh and unquenchable thirst for blood. No matter how many foes it consumes, The Blood Brute's ravenous appetite can never be sated, driving it into a perpetual frenzy. This cursed existence makes The Blood Brute an even more terrifying force on the battlefield. Its eyes burn with an unholy fire, and its roars echo with the rage of its demonic patron. The Blood Brute's presence is a harbinger of unparalleled carnage, as it rampages through enemy ranks, driven by an endless desire to feed and kill.

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
>  * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
>  * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
>  * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
>  * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.

### Megatuar Tactics
#### Combat Initiation
* Use Rushing Gore to close distance when enemies are out of reach.
* Once in melee range, target the physically strongest creature for blade arm attacks.
* Simultaneously attempt to grasp and swallow nearby, physically weaker creatures.

#### Rejuvenation Strategy
* The megataur requires creatures in its stomach to activate rejuvenation.
* If its health falls to half or less and there are no enemy creatures in its stomach or nearby, start swallowing weaker allied creatures to heal.

At the start of each of the megataur's turns, each swallowed creature gains a level of heat and then takes 14 (4d6) fire damage for each level of heat it has. The megataur regains 5 hit points for each creature damaged this way. A creature loses all stacks of heat once it is no longer restrained by the megataur. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points by the fire damage, it dies, and its body is dissolved. The megataur dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regain hit points from this feature.

> **Blood Call.** The megataur chooses a creature that just took its turn, which it can see within 120 feet of it, calling it into battle by having the creature's own blood turn on it. At the start of the creature's next turn, the target may move on its turn toward the megataur by the most direct route, trying to get within 10 feet of it. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal, except it can't move away from the megataur willingly and can't teleport.

### Megataur Loot
The valuable items looted from rat ogres will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Megataur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
