>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Swig (2/Day).*** If the gor is not poisoned, it can take a swing of its drink, becoming poisoned for the next minute and gaining 20 temporary hit points for the same duration. While it has these temporary hit points, it suppresses any effect causing it to be charmed or frightened, its Primal Fury trait is active even if it has lost it, and it automatically succeeds on Wisdom checks caused by its Primal Fury ability. The gor can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw at the start of each of its turns; on a success, the poison ends (this does not end the other effects).
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Battleaxe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.


> ##### Number of Swig Uses
> The default number of uses of the Swig represents the average amount of drink a gor is carrying with it at any given time. There may be a reason why a gor would have more or less drink on its person, and you can adjust the number of daily uses of the Swig ability to reflect this.
