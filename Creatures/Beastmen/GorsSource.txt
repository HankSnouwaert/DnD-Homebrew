> ##### Number of Swig Uses
> The default number of uses of the Swig represents the average amount of drink a gor is carrying with it at any given time. There may be a reason why a gor would have more or less drink on its person, and you can adjust the number of daily uses of the Swig ability to reflect this.

### Managing Primal Fury At Scale
 
If you're managing a lot of beastmen in combat and prefer not to roll each of the Primal Fury checks individually each time they come up, the following set of alternative rules can streamline this process.


At the beginning of combat, all beastmen enter combat with their Primal Fury active. On initiative count 20 each turn (losing all initiative ties), roll a d20. If the roll is 11 or higher, the Primal Fury of all beastmen remains active; if it is less, the Primal Fury ends for all beastmen until the next initiative count 20. Add a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll for each beastman in the encounter that is neither charmed nor frightened. Subtract 1 from the roll for each beastman that has been reduced to 0 hit points since the last roll.

Specific abilities of some of the beastmen modify these rules as follows:

**Will of the Dark Gods, Apocalyptic Vision.** If there is a beastman in the battle with one of these abilities, add a +5 bonus to the roll rather than providing advantage, as long as the beastman providing the ability is not charmed or frightened. 

**Crown of Horns.** If there is a beastman in the battle with one of these abilities, add a +5 bonus to the roll rather than providing advantage, as long as the beastman providing the ability is not charmed or frightened. 

**NOTE.** Are these bonuses cumulative?

\pagebreakNum

## Beastmen Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any gor or ungor to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

### Crown of Horns 
*This creature is gifted with especially large and grandiose twisting horns, granting it extreme confidence, for it knows it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

When the beastman makes a Wisdom check caused by its Primal Fury ability, it automatically succeeds unless it has disadvantage on the roll.

### Gnarled Hide

*The beastman's hide has toughed up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The beastman gets +2 to its AC.

### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Creatures that fail their save against the beastman's charge attack take 16 (3d10) piercing damage on a failed save rather than the normal amount of damage and half as much on a success. NOTE: This seems wrong. Is this a flat damage replacement?

### Many Limbed Monster

*The beastman sports an extra pair of clawed arms to tear at its enemies.*

When the beastman takes the attack action, it makes one additional attack as part of the action, which uses the attack modifier of its Gore attack. On hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage. (The attack also gains the benefits of Primal Fury.)

### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Shadow Hide

*The beastman's black fur melds perfectly with the darkness around it, allowing it to stalk its prey from the shadows while completely unseen.*

While in darkness, the beastman is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness. Additionally, it does not suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks from wearing Armor.
Finally, it gains the Bestial Ambush ability as described below. If it already has a Bestial Ambush ability, the damage bonus of its Bestial Ambush is increased by 10 (4d4).

***Bestial Ambush.*** When the beastman takes the Attack action for the first time each combat, its walking speed increases by 20 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If it hits with an attack during that turn that has advantage, it deals an extra 7 (3d4) damage.

### Slug-Skin

*This beastman's disgusting skin oozes thick, slippery, toxic slime.*

At the end of the beastman's turn, any ground within 5 feet of it is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Creatures standing in the area have disadvantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, and prone creatures in the area must spend all their movement to stand up instead of half. If a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. 

Beastmen (NOTE: what counts as a beastman?) ignore the effects of the slime. A gallon or more of water moving more than 5 miles per hour will wash the slime away from a 5-foot square area.

### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

<br>

> ##### Using Mutations To Create Urgency In Adventures
> If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with beastmen and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the beastmen in the adventure gain mutations as time passes. This means the more slowly and carefully the players progress, the more dangerous the beastmen will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. 
> 
> If you want the mutations to be random, you can roll a d8 to determine what mutation they will gain (number each of the abilities in alphabetical order).
>
> The rate at which they gain mutations could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.
>
> NOTE: Do they all get the mutation, and will this be cumulative?

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Gor Ravagers
These beastmen's signature ability is Swig. They will typically expend a use of the ability just before combat, letting the poisoned condition clear while retaining the temporary hit points. 

In the heat of battle, they will use the Swig ability again if they lose their Primal Fury or they drop below half health. It's important that they use Swig after they've made their attacks for the turn so they can minimize the disadvantage from being poisoned.

Because of their drunken nature, these beastmen will be even more wild and reckless than the rest of their kin, and you can reflect this by having them take more foolhardy actions in combat.

#### Bestigors
Because these elite warriors wear heavy armor, they often can't rely on stealth and ambush tactics unless they have cover from heavy vegetation. If they're unlikely to successfully sneak up on players, but they're teamed up with other beastmen who can, the bestigors will charge the players head-on. This will allow the sneakier beastmen an opportunity to move around and attack from behind while the players are distracted.

#### Manrippers
These beastmen prioritize attacking targets with low Strength so they can best utilize their Hewing Greataxe attacks. However, if the enemies they can reach all have high AC or abilities that make them hard to hit, the manrippers will change their strategy to attacking foes that are grouped up so they can attempt to make use of their Arcing Swing ability.

#### Wargors and Beastlords
These beastmen leaders fight from within the center of their minions, extending their aura to as many beastmen as possible. Because they're constantly seeking the favor of their dark gods, they will often challenge the most powerful adversaries they can find to prove their worth.

Because of their armor, their ambush options are often limited, and so they typically use the same combat initiation tactics as bestigors.

\pagebreakNum

### Gor Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Gor Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
