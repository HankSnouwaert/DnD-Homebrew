## Beastmen Chieftains
Beastman chieftains stand as towering figures of power <br> and authority within the savage society of the beastmen. These formidable leaders have risen through the ranks,  often through sheer strength and brutality, to a position where they command entire herds. Their ascent to power is a testament to their prowess in battle and their ability to dominate and control their kin, traits revered among the beastmen. A chieftain is not just a leader; they are the epitome of what a beastman aspires to be - strong, commanding, and fearsome.

Filled with a supreme sense of confidence and superiority, beastman chieftains view themselves as above all other creatures. This arrogance is not unfounded, as their physical and martial capabilities often far exceed those of their subordinates. Their mere presence on the battlefield is a source of inspiration for other beastmen, bolstering their confidence and battle fury. The chieftain's roar of command or charge into battle can ignite the frenzied rage of their herd, transforming a disorganized mob into a focused, albeit still chaotic, fighting force. Under the leadership of a chieftain, the beastmen become more than just a rabble of savages; they become a terrifying wave of destruction.

Coordinating the chaotic and unruly nature of the beastmen herds is no small feat, and it is here that the chieftains truly demonstrate their leadership. They are the strategists and coordinators behind the beastmen's raids and battles, adept at deploying their forces against the most hated enemies of their kind. Often, a chieftain is advised by a shaman, a mystical figure who provides guidance on the spiritual and strategic aspects of their campaigns. This shaman advisor plays a crucial role in decision-making, offering insights on when and how to best utilize the beastmen under the chieftain's command so that they best fulfill the will of their dark gods.

### Warhorns

Warhorns are formidable figures within <br> their herds, having fought fiercely to attain <br> their dominant positions. Their rise to power <br> is a testament to their unmatched strength and combat prowess, setting them apart from the other ranks within the beastmen society. These leaders see themselves as superior, not just in terms of physical might but also in their ability to command and direct the actions of their herd. Their authority is undisputed, born from a brutal culture where strength and the ability to instill fear are the keys to leadership.

Unlike typical leaders who might engage in the intricacies of governance, warhorns are singularly focused on maintaining their authority and orchestrating the acts of raiding and warfare that define the beastmen's existence. They are less concerned with the day-to-day affairs of the herd, leaving the herd to squabble amongst themselves. Their primary concern lies in ensuring that their position of dominance remains unchallenged. This involves a balance of displaying ruthless strength to deter potential challengers and demonstrating enough strategic wisdom to lead successful raids and battles. The life of a warhorn is one of constant vigilance and aggression, as any sign of weakness could invite challenges from ambitious underlings.

### Beastlords
Beastlords represent the apex of power and authority in the savage hierarchy of the beastmen. They are formidable figures, towering above even the mighty warhorns in terms of strength, leadership, and sheer presence. A beastlord's rule extends not just over a single herd but over multiple warherds, which they unite into a single, overwhelming force of destruction. Their ability to command and coordinate such a vast array of brutal warriors is a testament to their unparalleled dominance and strategic acumen. In the world of the beastmen, where might and ferocity are the cornerstones of power, the beastlords are the ultimate embodiment of these traits.

Under a beastlord's command, warhorns serve as lieutenants or subcommanders, each overseeing individual herds within the larger force. This structure allows the beastlord to exert control over a massive number of troops, delegating responsibilities to these trusted commanders while maintaining overall strategic direction. 

<br>

\columnbreak

<br><br>

The warhorns, in turn, respect and fear the beastlord, recognizing their superior strength and the privilege of serving under such a powerful leader. This hierarchy ensures that the beastlord's will is executed efficiently and ruthlessly across the multiple herds under their dominion.

To the other beastmen, a Beastlord is more than just a leader; he is seen as the living embodiment of the will of their dark gods. When a Beastlord unites the warherds for a campaign, he is perceived as a divine mandate, a signal that a great wave of destruction is about to be unleashed upon the civilized world. This belief imbues the beastmen with fanatical zeal, as they view their campaigns under a beastlord's command as sacred acts of war, destined to bring ruination and chaos in the name of their dark deities. The appearance of a beastlord at the head of a united beastmen force is a dire portent, heralding a time of strife and devastation for all who stand against them.

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Warhorns and Beastlords
These beastmen leaders fight from within the center of their minions, extending their aura to as many beastmen as possible. Because they're constantly seeking the favor of their dark gods, they will often challenge the most powerful adversaries they can find to prove their worth.

Because of their armor, their ambush options are often limited, and so they typically use the same combat initiation tactics as besthorns.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
