## Besthorns
Besthorns stand at the pinnacle of the beastman hierarchy, representing the most elite and formidable warriors within their brutal society. These fearsome creatures bear a resemblance to their longhorn brethren, but they are distinguished by their grander, more majestic horns and more robust, powerful physiques. While they may be of the same stock as longhorns, besthorns view themselves as a class apart, seeing the longhorns as inferior and unworthy of comparison. 

Armed and armored with the finest spoils of war, Besthorns have access to the best equipment looted from countless raids. Their weapons are often of higher quality the herd can get their hands on, and their armor is more complete and protective than that of the average beastman. This access to superior gear is a privilege earned through their proven prowess in battle and their elevated status in the herd. The sight of a besthorn donned in heavy armor wielding a massive battle axe is both imposing and terrifying, a testament to their position as the apex predators of their society.

In terms of combat skill and discipline, besthorns are a step above the typical longhorn. They are more battle-hardened and tactically astute, capable of executing complex strategies and holding the line where others might falter. This discipline and martial prowess make them the preferred choice for the chieftain's personal retinue, serving as both elite guards and the most trusted warriors in the herd. Their presence in a chieftain's entourage is a clear sign of his strength and the respect he commands.

However, the ambition and strength of the besthorns often put them in a position to challenge for leadership. It is among their ranks that contenders for the title of chieftain most frequently arise. These challenges are brutal and decisive, for in the world of the beastmen, might makes right, and the strongest rule. The besthorns, with their superior abilities and equipment, are often the most likely to succeed in these contests, ensuring that the leadership of the herd remains in the hands of the most formidable and fearsome among them.

### Besthorn Manrippers
Besthorn manrippers are the embodiment of sheer brutality and skill within the already formidable ranks of the mesthorns. These elite warriors have honed their mastery of the massive greataxes, weapons that are as deadly as they are symbolic of their wielders' status and power. The manrippers have earned their fearsome title through countless battles, where they demonstrated an uncanny ability to cleave through multiple foes in a single, devastating swing. 

The greataxes wielded by the manrippers are not just tools of war; they are extensions of their own savage nature. Honed to be as lethal as possible, these axes are capable of delivering strikes that not only cut through armor and bone but can also bisect an opponent with terrifying ease. The manrippers have perfected the use of these axes to such a degree that what might be a survivable blow from another warrior becomes a deadly, maiming strike in their hands. Their ability to turn the tide of battle with a few well-placed swings makes them both valuable and feared assets in any beastman warband.

In the ranks of the beastmen, the besthorn manrippers are viewed with a mixture of jealous awe and cowering terror. Their presence on the battlefield is enough to demoralize enemies and inspire their fellow beastmen with their sheer ferocity and combat prowess. As they wade through enemy ranks, leaving a trail of destruction in their wake, the manrippers embody the apex of beastman martial ability. They are not just fighters; they are symbols of the raw, unbridled power and savagery that define the beastmen's way of war, making them a terrifying force to be reckoned with.

### Besthorn Adventure Hooks
The following adventure hooks can provide you with some ways to incorporate these elite beastmen warriors into your adventures.

##### Beastmen Besthorn Adventure Hooks
| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1  |  **The Besthorns' Pact:** A series of brutal attacks by a group of besthorns on nearby villages leads to an unsettling discovery – they are not acting alone. They serve a more sinister force. The players must investigate the nature of this alliance, disrupt it, and face the combined might of the besthorns and their new masters.|
| 2  | **The Iron Convoy:** A convoy carrying masterwork weapons and armor is scheduled to pass through a region where besthorns have been spotted. The players are tasked with escorting the convoy, ensuring the besthorns don't plunder it to upgrade their arsenal.  |
|  3  |**The Bloodied Glade:** A sacred glade has been desecrated by the besthorn manrippers, who use it as a site for their brutal rites and trials of strength. A druidic circle enlists the players to cleanse and reclaim the glade |
| 18  | **The Beastpath Crossing.** The party stumbles upon an intersection of woodland paths used by the beastmen being led by elite besthorns and soon find themselves facing attacks from multiple directions by incoming beastman soldiers.  |


### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Besthorns
Because these elite warriors wear heavy armor, they often can't rely on stealth and ambush tactics unless they have cover from heavy vegetation. If they're unlikely to successfully sneak up on players, but they're teamed up with other beastmen who can, the besthorns will charge the players head-on. This will allow the sneakier beastmen an opportunity to move around and attack from behind while the players are distracted.

##### Besthorn Manrippers
These beastmen prioritize attacking targets with low Strength so they can best utilize their Hewing Greataxe attacks. However, if the enemies they can reach all have high AC or abilities that make them hard to hit, the manrippers will change their strategy to attacking foes that are grouped up so they can attempt to make use of their Arcing Swing ability.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
