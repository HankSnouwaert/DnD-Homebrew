## Jabbersnarls
Repugnant Monstrosities of Fear & Madnessbr
Habitat Forest, Swamp, Underdark; Treasure Any br
Among the most ancient groves, tainted by the malevolent presence of chaos, countless nightmares have crawled forth from the undergrowth. Yet none are more revolting than the jabbersnarl. Its array of legs—a grotesque mingle of insect and amphibian—rival the thickness of pine trees, each tipped with lethal talons that dig into the ground, ushering the beast forward as it drags its misbegotten, bloated, toad-like frame. Its bulk is so immense that even the mightiest ox would be crushed beneath its girth. Trailing behind, a terrible serpentine tail sways, tipped with a mace-like appendage sporting spiky protrusions as long as a greatsword. Upon its back rest a pair of massive, leathery wings, folded until splayed and bent, inexplicably lifting its disjointed mass into the air.

Most grotesque of all is the creature’s amalgamated head. Large ram horns crown its bulbous skull, beneath which sit sets of slitted eyes, each independently searching for its next meal. When a victim strays into its sight, the jabbersnarl opens its toad-like maw, revealing rows of jagged, shark-like teeth lining the interior. Amidst them, a mass of twitching chelicerae writhes, and between these sits a proboscis-like tongue. This tongue can launch as swiftly as an arrow with deadly precision, ensnaring creatures as strong as a full-grown minotaur and dragging them back to its lethal assortment of teeth. There, they are shredded and swallowed into its cavernous gut—all before most prey even realize their terrible fate.

brbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbrbr

Even if a creature manages to strike back at this eclectic array of deadly limbs, the jabbersnarl does not bleed blood. Instead, an acidic slime courses through its veins, spurting from wounds to eat through nearby flesh, wood, and steel. Yet the true lethality of this abominable creature lies in its very presence—for its amalgamated body is a magnification of nature’s most horrifying aspects, and the mere sight of such a horrid miscreation causes madness to run rampant. Those who lay eyes upon the jabbersnarl find their sanity eroded. As their minds break, some drop to the ground, curling into a ball, feebly attempting to process the monstrosity before them. Others gut themselves to escape the odious display, while some sink into such deep denial that they refuse to acknowledge the creature’s existence, even as its corded tongue latches onto them and pulls them to their doom.

jabbersnarls are drawn to the commotions and cries of the beastmen who share their corrupted woods, knowing such sounds lead to bountiful prey upon which they may gorge. This attraction can prove hazardous to the beastmen, for even they, worshippers of chaos’s foul deities, are not immune to the delirium the jabbersnarl’s appearance inspires. If insufficient enemies are present to sate its ravenous hunger, it may turn to feed on the herd that beckoned it. However, powerful Bray-Speakers can direct its unearthly cravings, steering it toward foes while ensuring it keeps a wide berth from the rest of the war party. When such manipulations succeed, the warherd greets the occasion with joyful braying, watching the misshapen figure of the jabbersnarl tumble from the sky, crashing into the midst of a disciplined army. All order shatters, replaced by hysteria as the beast wreaks its havoc.

 Visage of Madness. The jabbersnarl emits an aura in a 60-foot emanation from itself. Wisdom Saving Throw DC 17, each enemy that starts its turn in the emanation and can see the jabbersnarl. Failure The creature can't take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a d6 to determine its actions during that turn. Fails By 5 or More The creature rolls 2d6 instead. Fails By 10 or More The creature rolls 3d6 instead. br Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it can't see the jabbersnarl until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the jabbersnarl in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. 
  
 Hissing Blood. When the jabbersnarl takes slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage, each other creature in a 10-foot emanation from the jabbersnarl is covered in acid until it or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. At the end of a creature’s turn, if it is covered in acid this way, it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage.  
  
 Land's Stride. Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs the jabbersnarl no extra movement.  

 Limited Flight. The jabbersnarl falls if it ends its turn in the air while nothing else is holding it aloft. It takes no fall damage from falling this way.

 ### Actions  
  
 Multiattack. The jabbersnarl makes three attacks one with its Tongue, one with its Claws, and one with its Tail.  
  
 Tongue. Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 30 ft., one creature. Hit 10 (3d6) poison damage. The target must make a Strength Saving Throw DC 18. Failure It is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the jabbersnarl.  
  
 Claws. Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 18) by one of the jabbersnarl’s three limbs.  
  
 Tail. Melee Weapon Attack +10 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit 32 (5d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must make a Strength Saving Throw DC 18. Failure It is knocked prone. If it fails by 5 or more, it can't stand up until the end of its next turn.  
  
 ### Bonus Actions  
  
 Swallow. Dexterity Saving Throw DC 18, one Large or smaller creature grappled by the jabbersnarl (it can have up to four creatures swallowed at a time).

The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the jabbersnarl, and takes 17 (5d6) acid damage at the start of each of the jabbersnarl's turns. Br If the jabbersnarl takes 30 or more damage in a single turn from a creature inside, it makes a Constitution Saving Throw DC 15. Failure The jabbersnarl regurgitates all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the jabbersnarl. If the jabbersnarl dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained and can escape from the corpse by using 10 feet of movement, exiting prone.

 ##### Lingering Madness
 If you wish for the jabbersnarls to have more potent effects beyond combat, you can have creatures that fail their Aura of Madness saving throw by 10 or more suffer from Indefinite Madness until dispel evil and good is cast on them.

columnbreak

 ##### Minions of Madness
 In the standard stat block for the jabbersnarls, only enemies are affected by its Aura of Madness. However, if you wish to emphasize the jabbersnarl as a true creature of madness, you can have its allies affected as well. Depraved allies (such as Beastmen) can be somewhat tolerant of the jabbersnarl's presence—forcing them to still make the saving throw, but granting them advantage on the roll.
Allies that have already completely lost their minds (such as Spawns of Chaos) remain unaffected.

### Broodmothers & Their Spawn
Due to their twisted appearance and the maddening effect they have on the mind when observed, little is known about the jabbersnarls beyond their capacity to kill and the insanity that springs from their grotesque nature. The question of how these creatures came to be—or how they reproduce—has never been truly answered. jabbersnarls have never been found living in pairs, nor has any kind of egg or newborn ever been discovered.

Some speak of creatures referred to as toadlets—smaller, stunted versions of the jabbersnarl whose underdeveloped wings cannot lift them into the air—claiming these to be juvenile specimens of the species. However, the most chilling accounts come from the scattered testimonies of hunters who, after venturing into remote wilderness, returned days later in a state of incurable delirium.
Committed to asylums, these lunatics share one disturbing commonality in their wild ravings a massive creature that spews forth writhing hordes of larvae from its porous skin—parasitic spawn that latch onto victims, feeding on their sanity. Yet, as with all things told by unhinged minds, such ghastly statements remain far from reliable, dismissed as mere delusions by most learned scholars.

columnbreak

 In a lonesome hill-side, shrouded in woodland untrodden by the steps of men for untold ages, there lieth a cavern. Fain doth it hide its maw, glimpsed only through the thick-leaved bower by eyes full keen beneath the moon’s argent sheen, for by some fell decree, its yawnéd gate doth wither in the sun’s golden gleam. Shouldst thou dare to tread within that shadowed cleft, the air waxeth hot and reeketh with damp, swirling as though it were the very breath of a ravenous fiend. Were this not enough to send back any wight of sound wit, then let the walls, hewn as from wax riven by jaggéd talons, serve as harbinger of doom.
 
 Yet, if these dread signs stir not thy heart to quail, and still thy feet do press onward into the bosom of the earth, a chamber shalt thou find, and therein folly’s lone guerdon. There doth crouch a misshapen bulk, its wretched limbs folded ‘neath its bulk. Eyes slit and yellow awake at thy trespass, and limbs spread wide whilst its vile flesh doth quiver and pulse like the fretful sea. From its hide burst forth foul maggots, armed with needle-rimméd maw, spilling as sweat from a plague-ridden wretch. These loathsome spawn creep nigh, gibbering as the kin of newborn horrors doth fall upon thee. If thought canst thou muster in the midst of such madness, it should be to loosen thy bow and let fly thy shafts into the maker of this accurséd brood, to dim those eyes slit and yellow that fix upon thee. Yet arrows that strike deep pierce but to wretched ends, for such wounds gape wide and vomit forth yet more of her slinking progeny.
 
 Then doth the loathly thing, with eyes slit and yellow, unfurl wings vast as a ship’s sail, spanning its lair, and shake its ungodly frame, flinging its young in all wise as a tempest of noisome rain. Its foul issue o’ertaketh thee, a gaping maw fastening to thy head, feasting upon such scraps of reason as yet linger, unclaimed by those eyes, slit and yellow, that have taken so much. What then betid, I cannot tell, for I wakened upon the floor of mine own cot, leagues yonder, my flesh fouled with the filth of far wayfaring and riven with woe. How I came hither, I know not, and though time may mend my frame, the scars of my soul shall not so lightly fade. No soft bed, nor gentle touch, nor potent draught shall grant me ease. I crave only that Death may wrest from me the memory of that Broodmother, her swarming get, and those eyes, slit and yellow, that still do burn in my mind from that cavern in the lonesome hill-side, veiled by woodland untrodden by men, and that shouldst yet remain untrodden for ages uncounted.
 
 -Last writing of the Huntsman Leopold Totleben before hanging himself.

 Avoidance. If the maddening larva is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.  
  
 Horrid Cradle. The maddening larva can spend 5 feet of movement to be swallowed by a jabbersnarl while they share a space. While swallowed in this way, it is not restrained and can escape from the jabbersnarl by using 5 feet of movement.  (NOTE Is this ability only useable with the broodmother)
  
 ### Actions  
  
 Bite. Melee Weapon Attack +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit The maddening larva attaches to the target and pulls itself into the target's space. While attached, the larva moves with the target, and at the end of that creature’s turn, it receives a level of delirium. For each level of delirium a creature has, it suffers a −1 penalty to Wisdom-based d20 tests. The creature loses one level of delirium every hour that passes. 
  
 A creature can use its action to try to detach the larva and force it into the nearest unoccupied space, doing so with a successful DC 15 Strength check. On its turn, the larva can detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement. When it dies, the larva detaches from any creature it is attached to.  
  
 Reabsorb. If the maddening larva is swallowed by a jabbersnarl, it allows itself to die. Then, if the jabbersnarl is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw or check as an action or at the beginning or end of her next turn, it may immediately make that save.  (NOTE Is this ability only useable with the broodmother)

### Jabbersnarl Tactics

All jabbersnarls tend to place themselves in the center of the largest horde of enemies, using their tongue to pull distant targets toward them. They prioritize attacking creatures with low Dexterity scores or those refusing to look at them.
If overwhelmed—or once they’ve gorged themselves—they may reposition, but they will never flee unless they already have a meal in tow.

#### Broodmother Tactics
The Broodmother’s larvae obey her every command instinctively. She will spread out her spaw to make sure that they are not hit by a single AOE spell and killed. Having them each go for different targets.

##### Jabbersnarl Adventure Hooks

 1d6   Plot Hook 
--------------
  1   The Screaming Fog A choking fog has settled on a trade route through the woods. Merchants speak of hallucinations, missing companions, and haunting screams in the mist. In truth, a jabbersnarl has made the fogbound glade its hunting ground, and its very presence twists the minds of those who enter. The players must either guide a caravan safely through or take on a bounty to clear the cursed pass.  
  2   The Beast That Ate the Cult A newly risen cult worshiping a chaos deity has vanished from their woodland altar. Their camp is now a gore-splattered crater. Strange claw marks and slime trails suggest they summoned something they couldn’t control. The players must piece together the ritual, learn what was brought into the world, and determine whether it can be banished—or if it’s already too late.  
  3   The Beastmen’s Bargain Beastmen warbands have been striking settlements with unprecedented coordination. Reports mention not just the usual braying hordes—but also something worse crashing down into the battlefield. A Bray-Speaker has learned to call down a jabbersnarl and direct it toward enemy forces. The players must break the pact or slay the speaker to stop the next town from falling into madness and ruin. 
  4   The Stolen Toadling A group of reckless cultists has stolen an unhatched jabbersnarl spawn from a beastmen warherd. The players are hired to retrieve it—either by the cult's enemies or by the desperate cultists themselves, who didn’t realize what they were dealing with. The egg is hatching fast, and the players may soon face a ravenous, jabbersnarl toadling that’s already oozing madness. 
  5    Ravings of the Returned A renowned ranger stumbles back into town, bloodied and broken after a solo expedition into the wilds. His mind is shattered, and he speaks only in gibberish—until he begins screaming about a mountainous toad-beast that bled madness and birthed horrors from its own flesh. The players are hired to retrace his steps and uncover the truth, leading them deep into uncharted woods... where the Broodmother waits, surrounded by swarms of writhing Toadlets and parasite-larvae.  
  6   The Carnival Cradle. A traveling freak show boasts a new “star attraction” a caged horror they claim to be a genuine chaos beast. In truth, it’s a juvenile Toadlet spawned by a Broodmother hiding in the dark woods nearby, drawn to the sounds and smells of the traveling carnival. As the players investigate the unnatural changes among the performers and guests, the Broodmother arrives to reclaim her spawn—with an army of wriggling horrors in tow.

### Jabbersnarl Loot
Valuable jabbersnarl loot typically comes from harvested materials and usually requires a Wisdom (Survival) or Intelligence (Arcana) check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools) check to gather Hide). 

Alternatively, you can roll for loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Optional Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide Example Names and Quality Descriptors for items worth half or twice the table's gp value.

For example, a 100gp Bone item from a jabbersnarl could be a Jabbersnarl Fang, a 50gp version might be a Cracked Jabbersnarl Fang, and a 20gp version could be a Superior Jabbersnarl Fang.

When To Use Descriptions. You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

#### Optional Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The Magic Theme column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the Example Descriptor suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Chaotic loot could be used to craft items that warp space or time or produce unpredictable effects.
 
Random Magic Ingredients.
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Jabbersnarl Magic Themes 
Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot 75%
1d4  Magic Theme  Example Descriptor  
----------------
 1-4 br   Chaotic (EldritchRealty-Warping) Warped 
 4    Primal (DruidicNature)   Primeval  

Magic Loot GP Values. The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.
