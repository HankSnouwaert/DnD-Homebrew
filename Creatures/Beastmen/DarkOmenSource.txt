## The Dark Omen

The Dark Omen is a figure of dread and awe within the annals of human legend and folklore, a bray shaman whose name is whispered in fearful tones. His physical form is a grotesque testament to his dark powers, marked distinctly by a pair of large, tattered crow wings sprouting from his back. These wings are often kept hidden under his hide cloak, but when outstretched, they are revealed to be black as the deepest night and as ominous as the shadows dancing at the firelight's edge. They are seen as a physical embodiment of his cursed connection to the dark gods.

The coming of The Dark Omen is always foretold by a series of dark portents and ominous signs. In woodland regions, locals speak of strange hoofprints leading up to their door, flocks of crows that blot out the sun, and a sense of dread that settles over the land like a suffocating blanket. These supernatural occurrences have elevated The Dark Omen to a figure of religious superstition and fearful reverence among those living near the forests. Some unfortunate souls may even catch a glimpse of the creature leering from the shadowy forest edge, an event which all but guarantees impending misfortune and doom.

When he emerges from the darkest depths of the ancient forests, The Dark Omen is more than just a leader among the beastmen; he is the harbinger of doom and a prophet of despair.

 His origins are shrouded in mystery, with rumors suggesting he was chosen by the dark gods themselves, transformed from a mere beastman into a being of immense mystical power. His eyes are said to blaze with an unholy light, piercing through the shadows of the forest, and his voice carries the weight of prophecy, his words twisting the minds of those who hear them.

The Dark Omen's ruinous reputation is built upon countless desecrated shrines and fallen enemies, his mere presence spreading fear and chaos. He is not only a master of dark sorcery but also a tactician of savage warfare, leading his herds in brutal raids against civilization. His command over the beastmen is absolute, his will enforced not just by strength but by the sheer terror he invokes. In battle, he wields his malevolent magic with devastating effect, cursing his foes and bolstering his followers with the primal fury of the wilds.

Legend has it that The Dark Omen seeks to fulfill a dire prophecy, one that foretells a great reckoning that will engulf the world in chaos and darkness. As he moves unseen through the forest, the beating of his crow wings is said to be an omen of the dark times to come, a reminder that the beastmen are ever waiting at the edge of the civilized lands, ready to reclaim the world in the name of their sinister deities.

### Epic Encounter
If you wish to make The Dark Omen into a threat for end-game players, you can make the following enhancements:

* Increase his hit points to 600
* Increase the AC granted by his natural armor to 17
* Give him proficiency in Strength and Dexterity saving throws (increasing his modifier to +8 for Strength and +7 for Dexterity)
* Increase his CR to 20


### The Dark Omen's Lair
The Dark Omen does not keep a traditional lair or even stay in one area for long. Instead, he roams the land before choosing a location to bring ruination upon. This is usually a relatively isolated village or farmland near woods where he can establish a temporary lair. From here, The Omen slowly begins to sow terror among everyone living nearby.

When fighting within his lair, The Dark Omen's CR increases by 1.

#### Lair Actions

When fighting inside his lair, The Dark Omen can invoke the ambient magic that has saturated his temporary abode to use his lair action. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), The Dark Omen can cause the following effects, even while incapacitated:

Creatures without the Primal Fury or Unholy Fury abilities in the layer must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is overwhelmed by a sense of abject defeat until initiative count 20 on the next round. While overwhelmed this way, a creature can't add their proficiency bonus to saving throws, checks, attack rolls, or their spell save DC for spells they cast. If three or more creatures fail the saving, The Dark Omen gains a level of power for his Unholy Fury trait if the ability is active.

#### Regional Effects
Any region where The Dark Omen dwells for a significant amount of time is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of his lair:

* Strange footprints appear across the area, going up vertical surfaces, solid objects, and sometimes mysteriously disappearing with no trace. These footprints prevent The Dark Omen from being tracked except by magical means while in the area.
* Clouds in the sky form into leering horned skulls and other twisted faces.
* Beasts within the area become highly aggressive and agitated, causing creatures other than The Dark Omen to have disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks while in the area.
* Crows and carrion birds become predominant in the area and can telepathically communicate with The Dark Omen while he is in the area.

If Dark Omen dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

##### Dark Omen Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Omen's Shadow:** Rumors spread across the region of unnatural phenomena – crops failing, wildlife behaving erratically, and dark visions plaguing the dreams of the villagers. These signs are believed to herald the arrival of The Dark Omen. The players must investigate these omens, protect the affected communities, and uncover the true intention of The Dark Omen's visitation.|
|  2  |**Pact of the Crow:** A village leader, desperate to protect his people from the beastmen's raids, has struck a dangerous bargain with The Dark Omen.

### Dark Omen Tactics
The Dark Omen is a formidable spellcaster who is also adept in melee combat. He specializes in casting spells that are most effective at close range. Thanks to his fly speed, The Dark Omen excels in repositioning himself for optimal attacks and spellcasting.

**Minion Interaction:** While The Dark Omen can be an effective solo encounter, he works best with minions.

#### Spells
The Dark Omen's primary ability is Unholy Frenzy, which enhances his spellcasting power as combat progresses. Creatures attempting to charm, frighten, or interfere with the Dark Omen's ability to make Wisdom checks become his primary targets. The Dark Omen is a tactical spellcaster and avoids using spells on targets likely to resist them.

##### Summon Flock
The Dark Omen can cast this spell at will and should always have it active so that he gains a +12 bonus to Perception, bringing his passive Perception up to 22. Attacks made with this spell also benefit from the Unholy Fury trait.

##### Withering Resolve
Cast this spell on creatures likely to interfere with The Dark Omen's Unholy Frenzy checks, particularly targets lacking proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

##### Bray Scream
* **Use Case 1:** Cast when it can affect more than two targets.
* **Use Case 2:** Cast if The Dark Omen is airborne and is confronted by another flying opponent with low Constitution.

##### Impending Doom 
Best cast on targets with low Charisma or on those already under the effects of Withering Resolve

##### Wind of Death
Effective when it can hit two or more targets

##### Horrifying Laughter vs. Pit of Shadows
* **Horrifying Laughter:** Preferable when targeting a creature whose saving throw has been lowered, especially if it's already affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*
* **Pit of Shadows:** Generally a better choice when it can affect two or more creatures with lower Dexterity, particularly if no target is affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*

##### Savage Dominion vs. Purple Sun
Both spells are extremely devastating, but their usage depends on specific conditions:

* **Purple Sun:** Cast this spell when Dark Omen has 100 or more hit points and is not suffering from any crippling conditions.

* **Savage Dominion:** Opt for this spell if Dark Omen's action economy is low or he anticipates defeat in the next round. The summoned creature persists even after Dark Omen's demise.

##### Creatures Summoned With Savage Dominion
The preferred creature can depend on the state of the battle:
* **Giant:** Ideal for situations where adversaries excel in avoiding melee combat or are engaged in long-range fighting
* **Jabberwocky:** Ideal for disrupting enemies with its Burble ability and other debilitating effects. Note that the Burble ability can affect anyone in proximity, including The Dark Omen
* **Behemoth:** A versatile choice suited for targeting and consuming individual targets as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

#### Legendary Actions
When The Dark Omen is not in debilitating terrain and is surrounded by less than two enemies, it primarily uses its legendary actions to cast spells. If The Dark Omen finds itself in debilitating terrain or surrounded by two or more enemies, it will prioritize using its actions to reposition itself. When moving, The Dark Omen aims to move from one target. This strategic movement is designed to maximize the benefits of its Charge ability for its Gore attack at the end of its movement.
