## The Dark Omen

The Dark Omen is a figure of dread and awe within the annals of human legend and folklore, a bray shaman whose name is whispered in fearful tones. His physical form is a grotesque testament to his dark powers, marked distinctly by a pair of large, tattered crow wings sprouting from his back. These wings are often kept hidden under his hide cloak, but when outstretched, they are revealed to be black as the deepest night and as ominous as the shadows dancing at the firelight's edge. They are seen as a physical embodiment of his cursed connection to the dark gods.

The coming of The Dark Omen is always foretold by a series of dark portents and ominous signs. In woodland regions, locals speak of strange hoofprints leading up to their door, flocks of crows that blot out the sun, and a sense of dread that settles over the land like a suffocating blanket. These supernatural occurrences have elevated The Dark Omen to a figure of religious superstition and fearful reverence among those living near the forests. Some unfortunate souls may even catch a glimpse of the creature leering from the shadowy forest edge, an event which all but guarantees impending misfortune and doom.

When he emerges from the darkest depths of the ancient forests, The Dark Omen is more than just a leader among the beastmen; he is the harbinger of doom and a prophet of despair.

 His origins are shrouded in mystery, with rumors suggesting he was chosen by the dark gods themselves, transformed from a mere beastman into a being of immense mystical power. His eyes are said to blaze with an unholy light, piercing through the shadows of the forest, and his voice carries the weight of prophecy, his words twisting the minds of those who hear them.

The Dark Omen's ruinous reputation is built upon countless desecrated shrines and fallen enemies, his mere presence spreading fear and chaos. He is not only a master of dark sorcery but also a tactician of savage warfare, leading his herds in brutal raids against civilization. His command over the beastmen is absolute, his will enforced not just by strength but by the sheer terror he invokes. In battle, he wields his malevolent magic with devastating effect, cursing his foes and bolstering his followers with the primal fury of the wilds.

Legend has it that The Dark Omen seeks to fulfill a dire prophecy, one that foretells a great reckoning that will engulf the world in chaos and darkness. As he moves unseen through the forest, the beating of his crow wings is said to be an omen of the dark times to come, a reminder that the beastmen are ever waiting at the edge of the civilized lands, ready to reclaim the world in the name of their sinister deities.

### Epic Encounter
If you wish to make The Dark Omen into a threat for end-game players, you can make the following enhancements:

* Increase his hit points to 600
* Increase the AC granted by his natural armor to 17
* Give him proficiency in Strength and Dexterity saving throws (increasing his modifier to +8 for Strength and +7 for Dexterity)
* Increase his CR to 20


### The Dark Omen's Lair
The Dark Omen does not keep a traditional lair or even stay in one area for long. Instead, he roams the land before choosing a location to bring ruination upon. This is usually a relatively isolated village or farmland near woods where he can establish a temporary lair. From here, The Omen slowly begins to sow terror among everyone living nearby.

When fighting within his lair, The Dark Omen's CR increases by 1.

#### Lair Actions

When fighting inside his lair, The Dark Omen can invoke the ambient magic that has saturated his temporary abode to use his lair action. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), The Dark Omen can cause the following effects, even while incapacitated:

Creatures without the Primal Fury or Unholy Fury abilities in the layer must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a creature is overwhelmed by a sense of abject defeat until initiative count 20 on the next round. While overwhelmed this way, a creature can't add their proficiency bonus to saving throws, checks, attack rolls, or their spell save DC for spells they cast. If three or more creatures fail the saving, The Dark Omen gains a level of power for his Unholy Fury trait if the ability is active.

#### Regional Effects
Any region where The Dark Omen dwells for a significant amount of time is warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of his lair:

* Strange footprints appear across the area, going up vertical surfaces, solid objects, and sometimes mysteriously disappearing with no trace. These footprints prevent The Dark Omen from being tracked except by magical means while in the area.
* Clouds in the sky form into leering horned skulls and other twisted faces.
* Beasts within the area become highly aggressive and agitated, causing creatures other than The Dark Omen to have disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks while in the area.
* Crows and carrion birds become predominant in the area and can telepathically communicate with The Dark Omen while he is in the area.

If Dark Omen dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

##### Dark Omen Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Omen's Shadow:** Rumors spread across the region of unnatural phenomena – crops failing, wildlife behaving erratically, and dark visions plaguing the dreams of the villagers. These signs are believed to herald the arrival of The Dark Omen. The players must investigate these omens, protect the affected communities, and uncover the true intention of The Dark Omen's visitation.|
|  2  |**Pact of the Crow:** A village leader, desperate to protect his people from the beastmen's raids, has struck a dangerous bargain with The Dark Omen. The players are drawn into a complex situation where they must deal with the consequences of the leader's actions and confront The Dark Omen to prevent a greater evil from unfolding. |
|  3  | **The Doomed Village:** A village on the forest’s edge is suffering from a mysterious curse since The Dark Omen was sighted nearby. Villagers are vanishing, and those remaining speak of terrifying nightmares. The players need to break the curse, rescue the missing villagers, and confront the source of this dark magic.   |
|  4  | **The Crow Feather’s Trail:** A series of occult crimes and strange events in a city are linked by a single clue – a crow's feather, a known symbol of The Dark Omen. The players must unravel this mystery, leading them on a trail that connects the city's dark underbelly to the ominous forests and ultimately to The Dark Omen himself.  |

### Dark Omen Tactics
The Dark Omen is a formidable spellcaster who is also adept in melee combat. He specializes in casting spells that are most effective at close range. Thanks to his fly speed, The Dark Omen excels in repositioning himself for optimal attacks and spellcasting.

**Minion Interaction:** While The Dark Omen can be an effective solo encounter, he works best with minions.

#### Spells
The Dark Omen's primary ability is Unholy Frenzy, which enhances his spellcasting power as combat progresses. Creatures attempting to charm, frighten, or interfere with the Dark Omen's ability to make Wisdom checks become his primary targets. The Dark Omen is a tactical spellcaster and avoids using spells on targets likely to resist them.

##### Summon Flock
The Dark Omen can cast this spell at will and should always have it active so that he gains a +12 bonus to Perception, bringing his passive Perception up to 22. Attacks made with this spell also benefit from the Unholy Fury trait.

##### Withering Resolve
Cast this spell on creatures likely to interfere with The Dark Omen's Unholy Frenzy checks, particularly targets lacking proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

##### Bray Scream
* **Use Case 1:** Cast when it can affect more than two targets.
* **Use Case 2:** Cast if The Dark Omen is airborne and is confronted by another flying opponent with low Constitution.

##### Impending Doom 
Best cast on targets with low Charisma or on those already under the effects of Withering Resolve

##### Wind of Death
Effective when it can hit two or more targets

##### Horrifying Laughter vs. Pit of Shadows
* **Horrifying Laughter:** Preferable when targeting a creature whose saving throw has been lowered, especially if it's already affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*
* **Pit of Shadows:** Generally a better choice when it can affect two or more creatures with lower Dexterity, particularly if no target is affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*

##### Savage Dominion vs. Purple Sun
Both spells are extremely devastating, but their usage depends on specific conditions:

* **Purple Sun:** Cast this spell when Dark Omen has 100 or more hit points and is not suffering from any crippling conditions.

* **Savage Dominion:** Opt for this spell if Dark Omen's action economy is low or he anticipates defeat in the next round. The summoned creature persists even after Dark Omen's demise.

##### Creatures Summoned With Savage Dominion
The preferred creature can depend on the state of the battle:
* **Giant:** Ideal for situations where adversaries excel in avoiding melee combat or are engaged in long-range fighting
* **Jabberwocky:** Ideal for disrupting enemies with its Burble ability and other debilitating effects. Note that the Burble ability can affect anyone in proximity, including The Dark Omen
* **Behemoth:** A versatile choice suited for targeting and consuming individual targets as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

#### Legendary Actions
When The Dark Omen is not in debilitating terrain and is surrounded by less than two enemies, he primarily uses his legendary actions to cast spells. If The Dark Omen finds himself in debilitating terrain or surrounded by two or more enemies, he will prioritize using his actions to reposition himself. When moving, The Dark Omen aims to move from one target. This strategic movement is designed to maximize the benefits of his Charge ability for his Gore attack at the end of his movement.

### New Spells 

#### Horrifying Laughter
*6th-level enchantment*

- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A tiny tarts and a feather that is waved in the air)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Wizard
___

You target a creature you can see within range, causing it to collapse into debilitating fits of deranged laughter. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand for the duration. Creatures with an Intelligence score of 4 or less aren't affected.

At the end of each of your turns for the duration, any creature within 30 feet of the laughing creature that can hear the laughter must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the laughing creature until the end of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

At the end of each of its turns, the laughing creature takes 3d10 force damage and can attempt another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the spell ends. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it stabilizes but remains laughing and can no longer attempt saving throws against the spell. If the spell ends while the creature has 0 hit points, it dies.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 6th.

#### Impending Doom 
*4th-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black feather)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

You target a creature within range, sapping its determination and resolve to go on. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is filled with a sense of impending doom, and for the duration, whenever it makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not triggered by this spell, it automatically misses or fails if the roll is 6 or lower, as the creature feels an overwhelming sense of defeat.

The affected creature can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the spell's effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\columnbreak

#### Mystic Signal

*5th-level transmutation (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Druid, Ranger, Wizard
___

This spell enables you to broadcast a brief message, no longer than four seconds in length, to each creature within 3 miles of your location. Recipients of the message hear it in their minds and, if they know you, recognize you as the sender. Additionally, they discern your distance and direction at the time of casting. The spell ensures that creatures with an Intelligence score of at least 1 can comprehend the message's meaning. 

A sleeping creature can hear the message and may choose to awaken upon hearing it.

You can tailor the spell to target specific types of creatures only, such as humans, giants, unicorns, etc.

The message cannot be received by any creature if there is any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocking a direct path between you and the creature.

___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A goat hair)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Bard
___

You or a willing creature of your choice within range is filled with primal vigor and releases a powerful howling roar in a 30-foot cone. If the target is prone, it can immediately stand up without using any movement. Each creature in the cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 3d8 thunder damage and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone.

Additionally, the creature releasing the roar regains 3d8 hit points. Constructs and undead cannot regain hit points from this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, both the damage and healing increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Purple Sun
*9th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A pinch of lime, water, and earth)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a grim sphere of purple light at a point you designate within range. The sphere has a maximum radius of 60 feet and illuminates its area with dim light.

Any creature that either enters the sphere's area for the first time on its turn or begins its turn inside the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is petrified for the duration. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell (including the initial failed save), it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

If a petrified creature is physically damaged or broken during this state, it will manifest the same damage upon being reverted to its original form.

#### Savage Dominion

*7th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 hour
- **Classes:**   Druid, Warlock
___

You call forth a formidable creature of your choice: a **Stone Hurling Giant**, a **Madding Jabberwocky**, or a **Hungering Behemoth** (descriptions found on next page). It materializes in an unoccupied space within range and vanishes when reduced to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

\columnbreak

This primitive creature is allied with you and your companions. It acts on your initiative count, taking its turn immediately after yours. You can telepathically communicate with the creature while you are on the same plane, and you are both aware of each other's locations. It follows your telepathic commands without requiring an action from you. If not given any commands, it automatically moves toward and attacks the nearest creature it detects.

If the creature moves more than 100 feet from you, your concentration on the spell is broken. Additionally, at the start of its turn, if the creature has taken damage since its last turn, you must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or lose concentration.

If your concentration is broken, the creature doesn't disappear but becomes stunned until the end of its next turn, and you lose control over it. The uncontrolled creature cannot be dismissed by you and will disappear 1 hour after it was summoned.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the summoned creature gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 7th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, the spell's duration extends to 8 hours.

Upon casting, you summon three crows that circle above you for the duration of the spell. As a bonus action, you can direct one of the crows to dive at a creature or object within 120 feet. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it takes 2d4 piercing damage. If the attack is a critical hit, the target is blinded until the start of your next turn. Regardless of the outcome, the directed crow is expended. The spell ends if all crows are expended. For each crow circling above you, you gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks.

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pushed up to 10 feet away and knocked prone.

> ***Rend.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 5) slashing damage. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points by the attack, the behemoth may make another Rend attack against a different creature within 10 feet of the original target and within range of this attack. The behemoth does not gain another attack if it reduces the new target to 0 hit points.

>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* your spell attack modifier to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (3d10 + 5) piercing, and the target is grappled (escape DC equal to your spell save). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the behemoth can't bite another target. If the target is a Large or smaller and already grappled by the behemoth, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behemoth, and it takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of the behemoth's turns. If the behemoth dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.

On a failed save, a creature is hit by the thrown creature, takes 21 (3d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it dodges out of the way, takes no damage, and is not knocked prone.
