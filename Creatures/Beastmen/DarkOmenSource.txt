> ***Beast Man.*** The Dark Omen is considered a beast in addition to his humanoid type when determining the effects of features, spells, and abilities such as the *dominate beast* spell.
>
> ***Forest Camouflage.*** The Dark Omen has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in forest terrain.
>
> ***Land's Stride.*** Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs The Dark Omen no extra movement.

>
> ***Unholy Fury (1/day).*** At the start of his turn, The Dark Omen can begin channeling his unholy fury. At the start of each of his turns for the next minute (including the turn he activates this ability), The Dark Omen gains a level of power. He gains the following cumulative benefits for each level of power:
>
> * Access to new spells, each of which he can cast once per use of this feature. These spells don't require material components or concentration.
> * He can maintain concentration on an additional spell per level, which can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

>
> If no creatures fail saving throws against any spell The Dark Omen cast this turn, or if he is charmed, frightened, or has taken 100 or more damage since his last turn, he must make a DC 15 Wisdom check. On a failure, he loses one level of power.

#### Epic Encounter
If you wish to make The Dark Omen into a threat for end-game players, you can make the following enhancements:

* Increase his hit points to 600
* Increase the AC granted by his natural armor to 17
* Give him proficiency in Strength and Dexterity saving throws (increasing his modifier to +8 for Strength and +7 for Dexterity)
* Increase his CR to 20


#### Regional Effects
Though The Dark Omen doesn't have lair actions, any region where he is dwelling for a significant amount of time is still warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

* Strange footprints appear across the area, going up vertical surfaces, solid objects, and sometimes mysteriously disappearing with no trace. These footprints prevent The Dark Omen from being tracked except by magical means while in the area.
* Clouds in the sky form into leering horned skulls and other twisted faces.
* Beasts within the area become highly aggressive and agitated, causing creatures other than The Dark Omen to have disadvantage on Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks while in the area.
* Crows and carrion birds become predominant in the area and can telepathically communicate with The Dark Omen while he is in the area.

If Dark Omen dies, these effects fade over the course of 1d10 days.

### Dark Omen Tactics
The Dark Omen is a formidable spellcaster who is also adept in melee combat. He specializes in casting spells that are most effective at close range. Thanks to his fly speed, The Dark Omen excels in repositioning himself for optimal attacks and spellcasting.

**Minion Interaction:** While The Dark Omen can be an effective solo encounter, he works best with minions.

#### Spells
The Dark Omen's primary ability is Unholy Frenzy, which enhances his spellcasting power as combat progresses. Creatures attempting to charm, frighten, or interfere with the Dark Omen's ability to make Wisdom checks become his primary targets. The Dark Omen is a tactical spellcaster and avoids using spells on targets likely to resist them.

##### Summon Flock
The Dark Omen can cast this spell at will and should always have it active so that he gains a +12 bonus to Perception, bringing his passive Perception up to 22. Attacks made with this spell also benefit from the Unholy Frenzy trait.

##### Withering Resolve
Cast this spell on creatures likely to interfere with The Dark Omen's Unholy Frenzy checks, particularly targets lacking proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.

\columnbreak

##### Bray Scream
* **Use Case 1:** Cast when it can affect more than two targets.
* **Use Case 2:** Cast if The Dark Omen is airborne and is confronted by another flying opponent with low Constitution.

##### Impending Doom 
Best cast on targets with low Charisma or on those already under the effects of Withering Resolve

##### Wind of Death
Effective when it can hit two or more targets

##### Horrifying Laughter vs. Pit of Shadows
* **Horrifying Laughter:** Preferable when targeting a creature whose saving throw has been lowered, especially if it's already affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*
* **Pit of Shadows:** Generally a better choice when it can affect two or more creatures with lower Dexterity, particularly if no target is affected by *Withering Resolve* or *Impending Doom*
* 

##### Savage Dominion vs. Purple Sun
Both spells are extremely devastating, but their usage depends on specific conditions:

* **Purple Sun:** Cast this spell when Dark Omen has 100 or more hit points and is not suffering from any crippling conditions.
* **Savage Dominion:** Opt for this spell if Dark Omen's action economy is low or he anticipates defeat in the next round. The summoned creature persists even after Dark Omen's demise.

##### Creatures Summoned With Savage Dominion
The preferred creature can depend on the state of the battle:
* **Giant:** Ideal for situations where adversaries excel in avoiding melee combat or are engaged in long-range fighting
* **Jabberwocky:** Ideal for disrupting enemies with its Burble ability and other debilitating effects. Note that the Burble ability can affect anyone in proximity, including The Dark Omen
* **Behemoth:** A versatile choice suited for targeting and consuming individual targets as well as attacking groups with its Rend ability

#### Legendary Actions
When The Dark Omen is not in debilitating terrain and is surrounded by less than two enemies, it primarily uses its legendary actions to cast spells. If The Dark Omen finds itself in debilitating terrain or surrounded by two or more enemies, it will prioritize using its actions to reposition itself. When moving, The Dark Omen aims to move from one target. This strategic movement is designed to maximize the benefits of its Charge ability for its Gore attack at the end of its movement.

### The Dark Omen Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Dark Omen come from what can be harvested from his horns and wings or from relics and blasphemous icons he carries. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or identified using an **Intelligence (Religion)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### The Dark Omen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.
