## Moonspite
*The Wandering Lunar Horror*<br>
**Habitat:** Any except Underwater & Urban; **Treasure:** Any <br>
### Of the Coming of Moonspite
In the runes of old, traced in a tongue no longer spoken, is writ the doom of the elder days, when a horror was wrought upon the world. For in that time, the moon waxed full with an eerie light, and the Ancient Forests were bathed in a glow of green, a hue not of this world nor of kindly stars. And deep in the crannies of the wood, old things stirred—things that men, in dread, had cast into the depths—and they shattered the silence of the night with the cries of the unbidden.

Then rose from the glades and the hollow places a clamor most vile, for the old things, long hushed yet filled with wickedness, set forth in madness upon the world, reveling in their profane rites. And their howls and chants rose up as a dirge unto the sickly moon, whose visage hung low, brooding as one who waits to devour. For in that night of ruin, the moon drew ever near, casting down its jade light, till the vile dancers in the wood were illuminated as by the light of day, and the darkness was driven from their revels.

Then, upon the stroke of the witching hour, a stone of green loosed itself from the sundered moon, and through the heavens it fell, its burning wake a scar upon the sky. And it smote the earth in the midst of the howling throng, and the forests shook, and the land groaned, for all within miles of the impact—be they mighty oaks or nameless horrors—had their forms unmade and their voices silenced. And where once the cacophony of wicked mirth had echoed, now only silence dwelled.

Yet it is told that something stirred within the ruin. For from the shattered stone that fell upon the earth, there crawled a thing most loathsome, slick with the ichors of its unnatural birth. And as it beheld the ruin that lay about it, the thing cried out, not as beast nor man, but as some blasphemous mingling of the two. Thus did Moonspite come into the world, and thus did it set forth upon its accursed path.

### Of the Wanderings of Moonspite
When the moon waxes full and terrible, and the sky is lit with a glow not of the sun, then may Moonspite be seen. Across the hills it strides, and by the rivers it treads, and through the old groves it passes, its form glimpsed—a shadow against the lambent sky. And as it moves, it sings, but its songs are not meant for man nor beast.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

For its voice is as a dirge sung backwards, a hymn of woe in the tongues of men, yet perverted, inverted, and twisted, so that none may comprehend and none may bear to listen. And between its verses rise its cries—like the screams of beasts in agony. All who hear this chant, whether man or beast, lament the coming of Moonspite.

And on these nights, when the stars look down in pity and the wind dares not breathe, it is said that Moonspite seeks out the altars of old, those places where once the elder races built shrines to hold back the things that were before the dawn. For Moonspite knows no longing greater than to cast down these stones, to break their sacred wards, and to call forth the forgotten terrors, that they may feed once more upon the trembling fears of men.

### Of the Shape of Moonspite
Few have beheld Moonspite and lived, and fewer still have kept their wits upon their return. From the mouths of madmen what is known is this: that Moonspite rides upon a beast of two heads—one that speaks only truth, and one that weaves only lies. And as it rides, it sways, its limbs slick and wretched, clothed in wetness like a thing newly birthed. A mane of matted filth hangs about its neck, and upon its leech-like head are horns as of jade, shaped by no earthly hand.

And in the center of its brow are many eyes, slitted and filled with fire, pale and green, as the light that once shone upon the fires of its conception. And when it sings its terrible chant, swaying before the great moon that cast it forth, then do the heavens answer, and the sky is riven, and the stars themselves retreat. And out of the void come stones, burning green and bright, falling as a tempest upon the world, bringing low all who stand before the Harbinger of Madness.

For Moonspite shall wander the land until the last shrine of old is toppled, and the elder terrors of the world walk again in the places of men. And the song, not meant for man nor beast, shall ring louder than ever before.

> ### Traits  
> ***Aura of Madness.*** Moonspite emits an aura in a 60‑foot emanation from itself. Each enemy that starts its turn within the emanation must make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 17. *Failure:* The creature can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and must roll a d6 to determine its actions for that turn using the Madness Effects Table (found on the next page) If the failure is by 5 or more, it rolls 2d6 instead; if by 10 or more, it rolls 3d6.
>
> ***Land's Stride.*** Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs Moonspite no extra movement.
>
> ***Lunar Cleansing.*** When Moonspite or a creature it is mounted on must make a saving throw against its Unholy Zenith ability, it can choose to fail. If it does, it takes only half damage. Additionally, if it is affected by an effect that allows it to make a saving throw or check as an action—or at the beginning or end of its next turn—it may immediately make that save or check and automatically succeed.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** Moonspite has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Primal Fury (Recharges after a short or long rest).*** When Moonspite enters combat, it may choose to be filled with Primal Fury for 10 minutes. At the end of its turn, if it missed with all its attacks this turn, or if it is charmed, frightened, or affected by the *Calm Emotions* spell, it loses its Primal Fury.
>
> ***Shielded Mind.*** Moonspite is immune to scrying and to any effect that would sense its emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its location.
> 
> ### Actions  
> ***Multiattack.*** Moonspite makes two attacks.
>
> ***Shadow Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) necrotic damage, or 23 (4d8 + 5) necrotic damage if Moonspite has Primal Fury. If Moonspite moved 20 or more feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) necrotic damage and must make a *Strength saving throw:* DC 17. *Failure:* The target is knocked prone.
>
> ***Tormenting Bolt.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +9 to hit, range 100/150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (3d8 + 5) psychic damage, or 27 (5d8 + 5) psychic damage if Moonspite has Primal Fury.
> 
> ### Unholy Zenith 
> **The Dark Powers.** When Moonspite rolls initiative under the night sky, it chooses a point and calls upon Dark Powers to summon a shower of comets onto its foes. For the next minute—or until Moonspite dies—the Dark Powers, which have an Intelligence of 16, act autonomously and always in Moonspite's best interest. While active, the Dark Powers become aware of the location of any creature within 120 feet of the chosen point.
>
> **Summoning Comets.** On initiative count 30 (losing ties), the Dark Powers select three points 300 feet above the chosen point (each within 120 feet of Moonspite), causing those points to glow with a dim green light.
>
> **Comets Arrival.** On initiative count 0 (losing ties), the Dark Powers roll a d6 for each glowing point. For each point that rolls a 1–3, nothing occurs. For each point that rolls a 4–6, the glow disappears and a 5‑foot‑radius comet materializes at the chosen point and immediately descends. The comet passes through any Large or smaller creature or object, exploding in a 15‑foot‑radius sphere when it hits a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. The explosion's effects spread around corners.
>
> **Being Hit By Comets.** Each creature or object that comes in contact with one or more comets, as well as those within any explosion's area, must make a *Dexterity saving throw:* DC 17. *Failure:* A creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage. *Success:* Half damage. A creature can't be affected by more than one comet at once.

### Epic Battle: The Two-Headed Beast
If you wish to turn the Moonspite into an endgame threat, have him accompanied by his mount Umbraloth. Together, they are the equivalent of a Challenge Rating (CR) 20 encounter. Additionally, Unholy Zenith does not end unit both Moonspite and Umbraloth are dead, and Umbraloth may use its action to take the attack action even if it is a control mount.

### Approach of The Lunatic King 

Moonspite does not maintain a traditional lair or remain in one location for an extended period. Instead, he appears several days before the full moon, usually to enact some mad scheme that culminates on the night of the full moon. He then disappears once again after his work is done.  

The presence of Moonspite drastically affects his surroundings, bringing insanity that warps the land within 10 miles of his location, creating the Moonspite's Madness and Rain of Doom effects, which last until Moonspite leaves or dies.
 


#### Moonspite's Madness  
Whenever a creature takes a long rest and sleeps, it rolls a d6 and experiences one of the following effects based on the result:  


##### Sleep Effects
| 1d6  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|
| 1-2 | The creature sleeps as normal. |
| 3-4  | The creature witnesses a vision of the last atrocity Moonspite committed. |
| 5-6  | The creature witnesses a vision of the next atrocity Moonspite plans to commit or his ultimate goal in the area. |

A creature that sees any vision this way must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or suffer from Moonspite’s Madness. A creature can be affected by multiple madness effects. A creature that finishes a long rest outside the area affected by Moonspite can repeat the saving throw, ending one madness of its choice effect on a success.  

Creatures under the sway of Moonspite cannot find respite, as their minds urge them to carry out strange acts. Whenever a creature suffers from Moonspite’s Madness, it rolls on the table below. The creature cannot take a short or long rest until it performs the required action within an hour of resting. If it has multiple madness effects, it must complete all required acts before it can rest.

##### Madness Effects
| 1d6  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|
| 1  | The creature must howl at the moon under the night sky for 10 minutes without interruption. |
| 2  | The creature must travel one mile in a single direction under the night sky. |
| 3  | The creature must create a crude image of Moonspite, either by carving it into a surface or drawing it on paper. When the creature does this, Moonspite becomes aware of the act and its location. |
| 4  | The creature must sing about another creature with an Intelligence of 7 or higher that it has killed or maimed since its last rest. |
| 5  | The creature must break a manufactured object worth at least 10 gold as a sacrifice to the moon. Objects broken this way cannot be affected by the mending spell for 1d4 years. |
| 6  | The creature must take a vow to speak only truths for before it rests that lasts until it takes another rest. If it breaks this vow, it immediately takes 33 (6d10) psychic damage the first time it does so. |
