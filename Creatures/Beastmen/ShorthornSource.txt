### Managing Primal Fury At Scale
 
If you're managing a lot of beastmen in combat and prefer not to roll each of the Primal Fury checks individually each time they come up, the following set of alternative rules can streamline this process.


At the beginning of combat, all beastmen enter combat with their Primal Fury active. On initiative count 20 each turn (losing all initiative ties), roll a d20. If the roll is 11 or higher, the Primal Fury of all beastmen remains active; if it is less, the Primal Fury ends for all beastmen until the next initiative count 20. Add a cumulative +1 bonus to the roll for each beastman in the encounter that is neither charmed nor frightened. Subtract 1 from the roll for each beastman that has been reduced to 0 hit points since the last roll.

Specific abilities of some of the beastmen modify these rules as follows:

**Crown of Horns, Will of the Dark Gods, and Apocalyptic Vision.** If there is a beastman in the battle with one of these abilities, add a +5 bonus to the roll rather than providing advantage, as long as the beastman providing the ability is not charmed or frightened. If there are multiple beastmen with these abilities, the effects are cumulative.

## Beastmen Mutations

The following is a list of mutations that can be applied to any beastman to represent the effects the constant mutating power of chaos can have on them.

Applying a mutation increases a creature's CR by 1 (fractional CRs are doubled, e.g., a CR 1/4 creature becomes CR 1/2.)

### Crown of Horns 
*This creature is gifted with especially large and grandiose twisting horns, granting it extreme confidence, for it knows it has been blessed by the dark gods.*

When the beastman makes a Wisdom check caused by its Primal Fury ability, it automatically succeeds unless it has disadvantage on the roll.

### Gnarled Hide

*The beastman's hide has toughed up to the point that it serves as a layer of living armor.*

The beastman gets +2 to its AC.

### Gouging Tusks 

*The beastman has a large pair of tusks sprouting from its lower jaw, granting it an even more devastating charge attack.*

Beastman's charge deals extra 16 (3d10) piercing damage in addition to it's normal damage.

### Many Limbed Monster

*The beastman sports an extra pair of clawed arms to tear at its enemies.*

When the beastman takes the attack action, it makes one additional attack as part of the action, which uses the attack modifier of its Gore attack. On hit, the target takes 2d4 slashing damage. (The attack also gains the benefits of Primal Fury.)

### Rune of the Beast

*The beastman has a large eldritch rune carved into its flesh. When it becomes enraged, the rune glows red hot and distorting the winds of magic around it.*

While the beastman's Primal Fury ability is active, it has resistance to damage from spells, and when it is affected by a spell that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

### Shadow Hide

*The beastman's black fur melds perfectly with the darkness around it, allowing it to stalk its prey from the shadows while completely unseen.*

While in darkness, the beastman is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness. Additionally, it does not suffer disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks from wearing Armor.
Finally, it gains the Bestial Ambush ability as described below. If it already has a Bestial Ambush ability, the damage bonus of its Bestial Ambush is increased by 10 (4d4).

***Bestial Ambush.*** When the beastman takes the Attack action for the first time each combat, its walking speed increases by 20 feet, which lasts until the end of that turn. If it hits with an attack during that turn that has advantage, it deals an extra 7 (3d4) damage.

### Slug-Skin

*This beastman's disgusting skin oozes thick, slippery, toxic slime.*

At the end of the beastman's turn, any ground within 5 feet of it is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain. Creatures standing in the area have disadvantage on saving throws against being knocked prone, and prone creatures in the area must spend all their movement to stand up instead of half. If a creature ends its turn in the area, it takes 10 (3d6) poison damage. 

Creatures with Primal Fury trait ignore the effects of the slime (regardless of whether their Primal Fury is active or not). A gallon or more of water moving more than 5 miles per hour will wash the slime away from a 5-foot square area.

### Uncanny Senses

*The beastman's primal senses have been heightened to new levels, allowing it to perceive even the most well-hidden prey and the stealthiest of threats.*
 
The beastman has advantage on initiative rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks and does not suffer disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks in areas that are lightly obscured. It also gains blindsight out to 120 feet.

> ##### Using Mutations To Create Urgency In Adventures
> If you're running an adventure that focuses heavily on encounters with beastmen and you want to create a sense of urgency, you can have the beastmen in the adventure gain mutations as time passes. This means the more slowly and carefully the players progress, the more dangerous the beastmen will become. This can help keep the players from playing too conservatively. 
> 
> If you want the mutations to be random, you can roll a d8 to determine what mutation they will gain (number each of the abilities in alphabetical order).
>
> The rate at which they gain mutations could be on the scale of hours or days, depending on the scope and pacing of your adventure.

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Shorthorn Tactics
These beastmen are weak and cowardly by nature and will usually only press an attack if they feel they have an advantage that tips the odds in their favor. This advantage could range from a surprise attack to overwhelming numbers or the use of forested terrain to launch hit-and-run attacks. Once they feel they're on the winning side, shorthorns will charge in with the same reckless ferocity common to most beastmen.

##### Shorthorn Tormentors
These beastmen typically move ahead of the rest of their warband, setting up ambushes that their allies can capitalize on. If they can pull off the ambush, they'll use their poisonous attacks to weaken players and leave them more susceptible to the charges of other beastmen. Once an enemy is prone, the tormentors will surround it and ensure it can't get back up. These tactics make tormentors ideal allies for stronger beastmen like longhorns and besthorns.

##### Shorthorn Raiders and Stalkers
These beastmen are unique in that they avoid rushing into battle to use their Charge ability. Instead, they specialize in targeting foes their allies can't reach in close combat. They are skillful and opportunistic archers and will take cover between their attacks whenever possible.

\columnbreak

### Shorthorn Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Shorthorn Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
