## Morghul
*Eternal Avatar of Corruption*<br>
**Habitat:** Any except Underwater & Urban; **Treasure:** Any <br>
When the Sun goeth down and hideth its face beneath the edge of the world, and only the small stars remain to watch the turning Earth, and the little fires of men flicker in scattered towns and villages—then is the hour when the Watch is kept. Soldiers and Guards stand upon the old walls and in the old towers, their eyes turned to the dark places, watching for that which moveth under cover of night and cometh not with invitation, bringing sorrow and fear in its wake.
And as they watch, they speak low among themselves, telling dark tales not to comfort, but to sharpen the soul with fear, that weariness may not close the eye, nor dreams lull the vigilant.

They speak of a creature that rose alone from the blackened marshes, and wandered the wide Earth, coming at last to the gates of the cities of men. There it stood and called for kings, wishing only to bestow its gifts. What those gifts were, none now dare say—but those kings who took them wailed horribly and fled into the wilderness, as their cities toppled and burned.
They speak also of the thing that climbeth the mountain slopes in the hours when the Moon hideth her face. It is not alone, for behind it go the malformed—things of twisted limb and broken shape, who cry out for others yet dwelling upon the mountain, those who found no refuge in the ancient halls carved into stone. And the malformed call to them, saying: Come, be as we are. Join the parade of hatred and of grief.

They speak, too, of a village that was swallowed by a malicious wood. If one enter into the heart of that place, they shall find rusted gates, and buildings distorted and bent. And at their base crawl men and women upon all fours, hoofed and clawed, snarling like beasts. And within the shattered homes walk creatures upon two legs, clad in the tatters of human garb, speaking in tongues unknown—barking and hissing in a language that may not be broken.

In the center of that accursèd place groweth a tree, and it thrashèth and writhes like a beast snared in iron. Beneath its roots lieth a cave, and the walls thereof are of glass that floweth like the sea in storm. And within—He who is master of torment and of chaos. His desires are caught in the glass and move upon its surface, unspoken and undying.
Yet the Watchers know not that all these things, and more besides, are but the workings of one and the same. A spirit vile, who went forth upon the land ere the world was given its names. Since that time it hath crept and stalked and slithered in manifold forms, each more loathsome than the last. Wherever it goeth, there spring up mutability and madness, and chaos bloometh in its wake.
Other terrible beasts seek out the Thing of Old, that they might be given bodies of dreadful might. Their forms are shaped by the churning Chaos that eternally followeth the One who hath worn so many guises.

It seeketh not dominion, nor worship. It seeketh only that Order shall be unmade and forgotten.

### Morghul's Lair
Wherever Morghul makes his lair, the world around him twists like clay in the hands of a mad sculptor. Stone flows like water, reshaping itself into horrid architecture; trees contort into impossible forms as their bark peels away to reveal skin beneath. All manner of misbegotten creatures circle his domain—drawn to this locus of chaos, hoping to be reborn in the presence of the Lord of Mutations.


When fighting within his lair, the Morghul's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 1.  

#### Lair Actions  

On initiative count 1 (losing initiative ties), the lair chooses two unoccupied spaces at the edge of its boundaries. A Wicked Beast (stat block on the page after next) appears in each space and remains until destroyed. They act on initiative count 0 (losing initiative ties).

#### Regional Effects  

The presence of Morghul has a drastic impact on his surroundings, spreading corruption within a 10-mile radius of his lair that causes the following effects:

* Any creature in the area that ends its turn with three or more mutations gains a random deformity from the Deformities Table below. A creature cannot gain another deformity this way for 1 minute.

* Any creature that finishes a long rest within the area must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or gain a random deformity from the Deformities Table below.

These deformities persist until the *greater restoration* or *heal* spell is cast on the affected creature. However, you may choose to make the removal of deformities more difficult—turning them into a long-term plot hook or quest. Below are example methods for removing them:

##### Removing Deformaties

| 1d4 |  Example     |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1  | **The Sculptor Witch.** Tales speak of a strange witch who is both young and old. She works with white clay that she shapes into perfect likenesses of those who visit her. Any who gaze upon their statue may transfer a deformity into the sculpture—forever trapped in hardened clay. |
|  2  | **The Spring of Silence.** Deep within a gloom-stricken forest overrun by the restless dead lies a sacred spring. Its waters remain untouched by decay, an oasis that the cursed creatures of the wood dare not enter. Any who are baptized in its pure, silver waters are cleansed of their deformities. |
|  3  | **The Feast Below.** In the ruins of an abandoned village lies a cellar leading to vast catacombs, warmly lit and filled with unspoiled wine and impossible feasts. Gold lines the walls, and silken drapes hang. Here dwell radiant and alruing demons (Mariliths) who offer to remove any deformity with a single touch. But they will not stop at peeling away your deformities.

|  |       |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  4  | **The Moonbound Procession.** A procession of deformed spirits walks the world in mourning, visible only by the full moon’s light. Those who can predict their path and walk beside them from dusk to dawn will find a new spirit joins their ranks by morning with thier deformations transfer upon it.

<Br>

##### Deformities Table

|1d20 |        |
|:---:|:-----------|
|  1  | One massive, goat-like eye sits in the center of your forehead. |
|  2  | A mane of thick, oily hair grows down your spine that stands on end when you are angry. |
|  3  | Malformed, asymmetrical horns jut from your skull at odd angles. |
|  4  | Your face resembles a twisted beast’s muzzle. |
|  5  | Your legs bend like a goat’s, ending in cracked, blackened hooves. |
|  6  | Your skin is thick, leathery, and covered in patches of dark scales. |
|  7  | A second mouth sits sideways across your throat. It opens when you're angry or excited. |
|  8  | Your fingers are overly long, with too many joints, ending in sharp nails. |
|  9  |  A useless third arm hangs limp and spasming every now and then. |
| 10  | Your mouth is filled with rows of mismatched teeth that slowly fall out and regrow over time. |
| 11  | Your facial skin sheds daily like a snake’s molting. |
| 12  | Thin spines grow along your limbs, twitching when touched. |
| 13  | Small, insectile wings sprout from your back, flapping ineffectively. |
| 13  | Two tails drag behind you—one forked, the other bristled like a bottlebrush.. |
| 14  | Your tongue is thick, forked, and moves independently, tasting the air like a serpent. |
| 15  | One side of your body is covered in feathers that shift colors rapidly. |
| 16  | Tiny branches with Small blood-red leaves cover your body. |
| 17  | Twitching antennae grow from your skull. |
| 18  | You sweat rainbow ichor, staining clothes and leaving a sickly sweet scent. . |
| 19  | Your flesh become trasnluents allowing your orgains and bones to be seen. |
| 20  | Strange runes are carved into your flesh, writhing and shifting across your body. |

> ### Traits
>
> ***Adaptive Morphing.*** When Morghul fails a saving throw that required his action to make or when he fails a saving throw at the beginning or end of a turn, he can choose to succeed instead and takes force damage equal to 2d10 + the amount by which he failed the save.
>
> ***Aura of Transmutation.*** Morghul emits an aura in a 30‑foot emanation from himself. Any ranged attack that travels 15 feet or more through the emanation automatically misses. Spells and other magical effects can't extend into or out of the emanation. Each creature that ends its turn in the aura must make a *Charisma saving throw:* DC 15. <br> *Failure:* The creature suffers a random mutation from the Mutation Table on the page after next (*Mutation Save DC 15*). On a failure of 5 or more, it gains two mutations; by 10 or more, it gains three mutations.
>
> ***Demonic Restoration.*** If Morghul dies, he returns to life in 4d4 × 10 years and regains all his hit points.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Writhing Attack.*** Morghul performs two of the following actions at random. He can take these actions at any point during his turn, in any order:
> - **1. Shredding Claw.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) slashing damage. If this attack scores a critical hit, it deals an extra 10 (3d6) slashing damage.
> - **2. Erupting Flames.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) fire damage. If the target is a creature or flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the end of each of its turns.
> - **3. Morbid Strike.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) necrotic damage, and the target can’t regain hit points until the start of Morghul’s next turn.
> - **4. Shadow Spear.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) cold damage, and the target can’t see more than 5 feet until the start of Morghul’s next turn.
> - **5. Slimy Tendril.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) poison damage, and the target is pulled 30 feet toward Morghul.
> - **6. Destabilizing Touch.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) force damage, and the target has disadvantage on its next saving throw against Morghul’s Aura of Transmutation.
>
> ### Essence of Chaos
>
> When Morghul rolls initiative, he calls upon the Dark Powers to warp the world around him. For 1 minute—or until Morghul dies—the Dark Powers (Intelligence 16) act in his best interest. On initiative count 20 (losing ties),  one of the following effects is selected at random, and the powers then choose a point within 60 feet of Morghul; the effect occurs in a 15‑foot cube centered on that point:
>
> - **1. Booming Roar.** *Constitution saving throw:* DC 18, each creature in the area. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is sheathed in booming energy until initiative count 20 on the next round. If it willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, it takes 13 (3d8) thunder damage and the effect ends. <br>*Success:* Half damage.
> - **2. Snaring Vines.** *Dexterity or Strength saving throw (target’s choice): DC 18,* each creature in the area. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and is restrained by vines until they are destroyed (AC 15; 30 HP; vulnerable to slashing). <Br> *Success:* Half damage.
> - **3. Distorted Space.** *Charisma saving throw: DC 18,* each creature in the area. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 18 (4d8) force damage and is teleported to an unoccupied space of the Dark Powers’ choice within the cube that it can see. The chosen space must support the creature without squeezing.
> - **4. Spreading Nightmares.** *Wisdom saving throw: DC 18,* each creature in the area. <br> *Failure:* The creature takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage and becomes frightened until initiative count 20 of the next round. <br> *Success:* Half damage. When the fear ends (even early), each other creature within 10 feet of the affected creature (excluding Morghul) takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage.

### Epic Battle: Unbound Abomination
If you wish to make Morghul into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 594 hit points, and give him the Unbound Abomination ability. This increases his CR to 21.

***Unbound Abomination (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).***  If Morghul is reduced to half his hit points (297 or less), he may end any effects incapacitating, and he chooses two unoccupied spaces within 15 feet, causing a thing of chaos (stat block on the previous page,) to appear in each space. They act on their own turns On initiative count 0 (losing initiative ties). 

Additionally, for the next hour, Morghul's size becomes Large, and when he uses his Writhing Attack action, he can now perform three attacks instead of two.

### Mutations
Whenever an effect calls for mutating a creature, choose one of the effects from the table below at random.

### Sealing the Spirit of Chaos

Morghul is an eternal spirit of chaos—death is merely a delay to his return. However, if you wish to give your players a way to end Morghul’s cycle of rebirth once and for all, consider using one of the following methods:

| Method  | Description | Outcome
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  The Tome of Final Binding  | A blank tome with ever-hungry pages can trap Morghul if a prophet of great power records his wicked deeds within.       |  Morghul is sealed inside the tome. If the book is destroyed or read aloud, he is released.   |
|  The Grove of Reckoning  | If defeated in a sacred grove blessed by archfey, Morghul’s power can be drained and consumed by these ancient beings.       | Morghul is prevented from returning. However, the consequences of the archfey absorbing his chaotic essence are unknown.      | 
|  The Mirror of Dread Reflection  | A legendary mirror reacts to Morghul’s reflection, becoming a portal to a nightmare realm shaped by his hatred.       | If Morghul is forced through the mirror and it is shattered, he is trapped in a prison of his own making.      |
|  The Shattered Name  | Morghul’s true name was shattered and scattered across the world, embedded in beasts, trees, and relics.      | If all fragments are gathered and his true name restored, Morghul assumes a final, nightmarish form—one that can be permanently destroyed.      |

### Morghul's Tactics
Morghul's attacks are determined randomly, but he applies a strategy based on the mutations of his targets. Each attack favors specific conditions or mutations.

#### Writhing Attacks
* **Shredding Claw.** Targets a creature with the Degeneration mutation.
* **Erupting Flames.** Targets a creature with the Wild Spasms mutation, or those not adjacent to any allies.
* **Morbid Strike.** Targets creatures with the Regeneration mutation.
* **Shadow Spear.** Targets ranged creatures.
* **Slimy Tendrils.** Targets ranged creatures or those with the Gelatinous Legs or Inverted Eyes mutations.
* **Destabilizing Touch.** Targets creatures with low Charisma, or those with Gelatinous Legs or Inverted Eyes.

#### Essence of Chaos
This ability always targets the largest group of creatures. If multiple groups have the same number of targets, the Dark Powers choose based on which mutations they can exploit:

* **Booming Roar.** Targets the group with the fewest mutations.
* **Snaring Vines.** Targets creatures with Twisted Arms and Wild Spasms.
* **Distorted Space.** Targets creatures with Gelatinous Legs.
* **Spreading Nightmares.** Also targets creatures with Gelatinous Legs.

#### Lair Effects
* Wicked Beasts created by the lair attack creatures they have advantage against.
* Once a Wicked Beast transforms into a Thing of Chaos, it uses the same targeting logic as Morghul to determine its attacks.

### Morghul's Loot
Valuable loot dropped by Morghul typically comes from harvested materials found amongst his deformed remains and usually requires a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a **Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools)** check to gather Hide). 

##### Morghul Loot (Avg. 1,800gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Items (500gp) |
|  10-14 | 1 1,000gp Item (1,000gp) | 
|  15-21 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items (2,000gp) |  
|  22-25 | 1 2,000gp Items (2,000gp)  |  
|  26+ |  1d4(2) 2,000gp Items (4,000gp) |

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 1,000gp Bone item from Morghul could be Morghul's Horn, a 500gp version might be a Morghul's Cracked Horn, and a 2,000gp version could be a Morghul's Prime Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.



##### Morghul Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d6 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|  Morghul's Horn (Cracked/Prime) | 
| 2   | Cloth | Morghul's Cowl (Tattered/Prime)|  
| 3   | Hide | Morghul's Hide (Tattered/Prime)|  
| 4   | Flesh |  Morghul's Flesh (Stringy/Prime) |  
| 5  | Fluid |Morghul's Blood (Diluted/Prime) | 
| 6  | Wood |Morghul's Totem Scraps (Damaged/Prime) | 

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting

If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In Morghul's case, Chaos effects would make the most sense. These would be magic item effects that warp reality or induce mutations or madness in their targets.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.
