## Spawns of Chaos
*Mutant Abominations Warped By The Power of Chaos*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** None <br>
Over untold ages, as chaotic realms have breached  <br> mortal plane, these incursions have birthed a plethora of abominations, their malign influence twisting all caught in their path. Some creatures, bathed in mutating energies, become beings that defy all logic and order. These nightmarish anomalies are broadly known as spawns of chaos.

These cosmic mockeries arise in myriad ways—perhaps a warrior of the Dark Gods is bestowed with too many "blessings" from their fickle patron, warping their body beyond recognition. Or a sorcerer foolishly channels raw power from the distant realms, their body and mind fracturing under the strain of such immense magic. Others undergo this cruel metamorphosis merely by standing in the presence of a virulent monument or a great herald of the Ruinous Gods.

Though the means of a spawn’s creation are countless, their forms and abilities are infinite. Some are grotesque amalgamations of limbs from men and beasts, fused into a disorienting and horrifying jumble. Others bear the heads of massive insects, cloaked in coarse, woolly hair, crowned with stag-like antlers or sharp beaks that part to reveal rows of human teeth. Some possess powerful equine limbs that end in fleshy, flowering patterns of fingers, each tipped with a wicked stinger.

Others are even more bizarre—composed almost entirely of raw, corded muscle, riddled with jagged bony protrusions and snapping jaws strewn haphazardly across their hulking figures. Some are little more than writhing masses of snake-like tendrils, their soft, silken skin crisscrossing as they release strange, intoxicating scents and sounds that enrapture those unfortunate enough to encounter them.

More grotesque still are those whose bloated forms are covered in shifting tumors and sores, rupturing under their own strain to release all manner of putrid mucus. Most bizarre of all, however, are those whose unstable forms are not composed of any organic material—lumps of flowing metal or wax, their ever-shifting surfaces revealing fleeting visages that scream, letting loose gouts of colorful flames and light before melting back into the mass.

Whatever monstrous configuration these epitomes of discord take, they all share an inherent instability in their existence. All spawns of chaos are erratic and violent, destroying anything their impulsive whims lead them to. Ultimately, all are doomed—either to die in conflict or to be torn apart by the very energies that birthed them.

##### Spawn of Chaos Adventure Hooks

| 1d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Mutating Ruins:** An ancient ruin, long sealed away, has begun to leak strange, reality-warping energy. Locals whisper of travelers who entered and emerged twisted beyond recognition, or worse, never returned at all. The players are sent to investigate and navigate a crumbling labyrinth where the walls pulse with unnatural life and spawns of chaos formed from the fused bodies of previous explorers lurk.  |
|  2  | **The Cursed Champion:** A mighty warrior devoted to the Dark Gods has been "blessed" too many times, their body grotesquely twisted into a monstrous Spawn of Chaos. However, their former warband refuses to let them die, instead worshiping them as a divine avatar. The players must infiltrate this zealous warband, fight through hordes of fanatics, and put down the rampaging spawn before its mutations spread further.
  |
|  3  | **The Flesh Hive:** A once-thriving town has become eerily silent, its streets overgrown with strange, pulsating growths. Those who enter are greeted by whispers in the walls, disjointed limbs sprouting from cobblestone, and flesh melding into wood and iron. The town’s people have been consumed, fused together into a colossal Spawn of Chaos, which now writhes beneath the town square, birthing lesser horrors that crawl through the ruins. |


\columnbreak

<br><br><br>

|  | |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  4  | **The Eldritch Caravan:** A traveling merchant caravan arrives in town, selling rare and exotic wares. However, strange occurrences begin—shadows stretch in the wrong direction, people wake up changed, and some disappear entirely. The caravan’s leader has unknowingly acquired a relic that is birthing Spawns of Chaos in the night, twisting both people and objects into abominations. The players must investigate before the town is lost to corruption. |
|  5  | **The Tower of Madness:** An abandoned wizard’s tower has become a beacon of chaos, warping the landscape around it. Inside, space folds in on itself, corridors loop endlessly, and doors lead to nowhere. The wizard, long since consumed by their own experiments, has transformed into a monstrous Spawn of Chaos, their body fusing with their spellbooks and laboratory equipment, turning the tower into a living nightmare.  |
|  6  | **The Living Battlefield:** A war long ago was fought on cursed ground, and now, the battlefield itself refuses to rest. The bodies of the dead have merged into a horrific Spawn of Chaos, a lumbering mass of bone, armor, and flesh that shifts unpredictably. The players must destroy it before it awakens fully, lest it rampage across the land, absorbing everything in its path. |

### Lesser Spawn of Chaos Alternative Writhing Attack Tables

The following are additional action sets for the spawn's Writhing Attack, which can be used instead of its normal set. Each set is organized thematically, but feel free to mix and match to create your own table of six.


##### Lesser Spawn of Rage Table  
| 1d6  | Actions | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|:-----------|
| 1 | **Mangling Talons** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 14 (4d6) slashing damage, and the target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 13. *Failure:* The target suffers a rending wound. While wounded, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution d20 Tests, and its speed is halved. The wound ends if the creature regains 15 or more hit points at once, or if the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to stanch the wound by succeeding on a Wisdom (Medicine) check: DC 13.|
| 2 | **Bone Spike** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 10 (3d6) piercing damage. If the spawn moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before this hit and the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the spike and becomes grappled (escape DC 13). While grappled, the target is restrained and takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage at the start of each of the spawn’s turns. |
| 3 | **War Stomp** | *Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw (target’s choice):* DC 13, each other creature in a 10-foot emanation from the spawn. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared. *Failure:* The creature takes 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. |
| 4 | **Flesh Feast** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 10 (3d6) piercing damage, and the spawn regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. |
| 5 | **Blood Disgorge** | *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 13 each creature in a 30-foot cone. *Failure:* The creature takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and can’t regain hit points until the start of the spawn’s next turn. *Success:* Half damage only |
| 6 | **Murderous Fit** | The spawn’s speed increases by 20 feet until the end of its turn, and it can make up to three attacks. Each attack must be against a different target. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage. |

| 2 | **Warping Breath** | *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 13, each creature in a 30-foot cone. *Failure:* A creature takes 7 (2d6) force damage and is teleported to an unoccupied space of the spawn’s choice that it can see within the cone’s area. The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without it having to squeeze. *Success:* Half damage only. |
| 3 | **Molten Liquids** | *Ranged or Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., *Hit:* 17 (5d6) fire damage. |
| 4 | **Burning Limbs** | *Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 15 ft., *Hit:* 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is a creature or a flammable object, it ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire, the target takes 7 (2d6) fire damage at the end of each of its turns. |
| 5 | **Unstable Field** | The spawn gains 15 temporary hit points until the start of its next turn. If a creature damages the spawn with an attack while within 30 feet of it and the spawn still has these temporary hit points, the attacker takes 3 (1d6) lightning damage. |
| 6 | **Disruptive Slam** | *Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage, and the target is sheathed in chaotic energy until the start of the spawn’s next turn. If the target casts a spell before then, it takes 14 (4d6) force damage, and the effect ends. |

| 6 | **Gift of Infestation** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 7 (2d6) piercing damage, and insects burrow into the target’s flesh, infesting it. While infested, the target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. Any creature within reach can use an action to make a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check to remove the insects using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, causing 1d6 damage of the same type to the target on a success (the effect then ends). A creature can choose to make the check more aggressively, gaining advantage, but if it does, the target instead takes 2d6 damage. |

The following are additional action sets for the spawn's Writhing Attack, which can be used instead of its normal set. Each set is organized thematically, but feel free to mix and match to create your own table of six.


##### Chaos Spawn of Rage Table
| 1d6  | Actions | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|:-----------|
| 1 | **Mangling Talons** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 22 (4d10) slashing damage, and the target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 13. *Failure:* The target suffers a rending wound. While wounded, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution d20 Tests, and its speed is halved. The wound ends if the creature regains 15 or more hit points at once, or if the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to stanch the wound by succeeding on a Wisdom (Medicine) check: DC 15.|
| 2 | **Bone Spike** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage. If the spawn moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before this hit and the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the spike and becomes grappled (escape DC 15). While grappled, the target is restrained and takes 5 (1d10) piercing damage at the start of each of the Chaos Spawn’s turns. |
| 3 | **War Stomp** | *Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw (target’s choice):* DC 15, each other creature in a 10-foot emanation from the spawn. If the ground in that area is loose earth or stone, it becomes difficult terrain until cleared. *Failure:* A creature takes 11 (2d10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone. |
| 4 | **Flesh Feast** | *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 16 (3d10) piercing damage, and the spawn regains hit points equal to the damage dealt. |
| 5 | **Blood Disgorge** | *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 15, each creature in a 30-foot cone. *Failure:* 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and the creature can't regain hit points until the start of the spawn’s next turn. *Success:* Half damage only. |
| 6 | **Murderous Fit** | The spawn’s speed increases by 20 feet until the end of its turn, and it may make up to three attacks. Each attack must be against a different target. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 16 (3d10) bludgeoning damage. |

| 5 | **Unstable Field** | The spawn gains 20 temporary hit points until the start of its next turn. If a creature damages the spawn with an attack while within 30 feet of it and the spawn still has these temporary hit points, the attacker takes 5 (1d10) lightning damage. |

> ***Adaptive Morphing.*** When the spawn fails a saving throw that required its action to make or fails a saving throw at the beginning or end of a turn, it can choose to succeed instead. If it does so, it takes force damage equal to 2d10 plus the amount by which it failed the save.

>
> ***Shambling Horror.*** At the start of the spawn's turn, its walking speed increases by 2d6 × 10 feet until the start of its next turn.  
>
> ### Actions
> ***Writhing Attack.*** The spawn performs two of the following actions at random. It can take these actions at any point during its turn, in any order:

If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 18. *Failure:* The target is swallowed by the spawn (up to four creatures can be swallowed at a time). While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and effects outside the spawn, and takes 11 (2d10) acid damage at the start of each of the spawn’s turns. 
> If the spawn takes 30 or more damage on a single turn from a creature inside it, the spawn must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 18) at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone within 10 feet of it. If the spawn dies, any swallowed creature is no longer restrained and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement, exiting prone.
> - **4. Ram.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 38 (7d10) bludgeoning damage.

|  22-25 | 2d12(13) 100gp Items (1,300gp)  |  
|  26+ |  2d12(13) 200gp Items (2,600gp) |  

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Bone item from a spawn could be a Twisted Claw, a 5gp version might be a Cracked Twisted Claw, and a 20gp version could be a Superior Twisted Claw.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The **Magic Theme** column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the **Example Descriptor** suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Chaotic loot could be used to craft items that warp space or time or produce unpredictable effects.
 
***Random Magic Ingredients.***
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Spawn of Chaos Magic Themes 
**Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot: 80%**
|1d4 | Magic Theme | Example Descriptor | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-2 <br>  | Chaotic (Eldritch/Realty-Warping)| Chaos-Infused| 
| 3-4   | Fiendish  | Demonic|  

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

### New Conditions

#### Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

#### Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
