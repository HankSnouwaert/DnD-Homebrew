## Beastman Longhorns

Longhorns are the primary representation of a beastman, forming the backbone of their savage herds. They are a fearsome blend of animal and human. Their lower bodies boast powerful, goat-like, bipedal legs, adept for traversing rough, forested terrains with ease. Their human-like torsos and arms showcase grotesque but powerful muscles. Above this, their heads are akin to that of a fanged goat, complete with menacing horns. However, within their ranks, many variations of beastman can exist, exhibiting a mix of traits from different wild animals. This diversity adds to their terrifying presence, as each longhorn presents a unique yet uniformly intimidating appearance.

The longhorns make up the majority of the beastmen herds. Their numbers are vast, and they form the core of the beastmen's marauding forces. Characterized by their rowdy and impulsive nature, longhorns are creatures of instinct and aggression. They are quick to anger, and once provoked, their fury is relentless and brutal.

This temperament, while often chaotic, is a significant asset in the heat of battle, as it fuels their ferocity and resilience. However, once they lose their momentum and their fury burns out, they can become less confident and unreliable fighters.

Longhorns are primarily melee combatants, relying on their natural speed and brute strength to overpower their foes. They typically lack discipline, and their equipment is often crudely made and poorly maintained, but what they lack in finesse, they more than make up for with sheer rage-fueled power. Their approach to battle is straightforward and savage: they charge headlong into enemy ranks, using their horns, teeth, and any weapon at hand to wreak havoc. This makes them excellent shock troops, capable of breaking enemy lines through sheer force and the intimidating might of their charge. Foes knocked prone by the charge of their horns are quickly dogpiled by other beastmen who relish the opportunity to prey on a newly vulnerable victim.

#### Longhorn Ravagers

Longhorn ravagers, a notorious subgroup within the beastman ranks, are as feared for their chaotic behavior as they are for their combat prowess. Known for their love of potent, rank brews, these ravagers are seldom seen without their signature flasks or containers of alcohol. This drink, foul to any but their own kind, serves as a source of inebriation and a form of battle stimulant. In the midst of combat, the intoxicating effects of their brew do more than impair; they invigorate the ravagers, fueling their already formidable aggression and bolstering their confidence. This alcohol-induced bravado often turns the tide of battle, as the ravagers, lost in their drunken fury, become even more fearsome and unpredictable adversaries.

The longhorn ravagers have also developed a unique fighting style that incorporates their drinking vessels. Whether it's a crude mug, a battered flask, or even an entire keg, these containers are not just for holding their brew but are also cleverly used as improvised shields. This unconventional approach to defense is surprisingly effective, allowing the ravagers to absorb blows that would fell lesser beastmen. 

Despite their drunken demeanor, the destructive power of the longhorn ravagers should not be underestimated. Their alcohol-induced courage often leads them to hold their ground in the face of overwhelming odds, where other beastmen might break and flee. This tenacity, coupled with their wild, unpredictable nature, makes them unlikely elite warriors. In battle, the ravagers are the embodiment of chaotic strength, a whirlwind of fury and resilience, their roars of inebriated rage echoing as both a battle cry and a warning to all who face them.

### Beastmen Infantry Tactics
The beastmen are hard-hitting ambushers. They aren't as effective if they can't catch their foes by surprise or are stuck in a prolonged fight. Nonetheless, their recklessly aggressive nature and intense disdain for civilization will often drive them into fights where they may not have the best tactical advantages. 

There are a few abilities common to all beastmen infantry.

**Bestial Ambush.** This ability's primary purpose is to give beastmen an offensive edge when they first engage with players. However, it doesn't always need to be used in the first round of combat. Some stealthier beastmen can wait until they've snuck up on a better target before making their first attack and triggering the ability.

**Charge & Gore.** While every beastman can use their Charge ability to knock a foe prone, most can't capitalize on the advantage it grants them due to not having multiattack. Therefore, it works best to have multiple beastmen gang up on a single target so others can make follow-up attacks on prone targets.

**Primal Fury.** Beastmen will never flee while this ability is active. This ability underscores the importance of ensuring beastmen do whatever they can to help their attacks hit. This most commonly includes attacking surprised or prone enemies.

#### Longhorn Tactics
Longhorns make up the bulk of most beastmen warherds. When fighting together, they form a rowdy mob drunk on their confidence and recklessly charging into enemies. If the fight doesn't quickly go in their favor, sobering reality may set in, causing them to break and flee if they don't have a leader keeping them in line.

##### Longhorn Ravagers
These beastmen's signature ability is Swig. They will typically expend a use of the ability just before combat, letting the poisoned condition clear while retaining the temporary hit points. 

In the heat of battle, they will use the Swig ability again if they lose their Primal Fury or they drop below half health. It's important that they use Swig after they've made their attacks for the turn so they can minimize the disadvantage from being poisoned.

Because of their drunken nature, these beastmen will be even more wild and reckless than the rest of their kin, and you can reflect this by having them take more foolhardy actions in combat.

### Beastmen Loot
Because beastmen are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying, though it is common to harvest horns from their fallen. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Beastmen Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Longhorn Loot Table

|  18-21 | 1d4(2) 1gp Items |
