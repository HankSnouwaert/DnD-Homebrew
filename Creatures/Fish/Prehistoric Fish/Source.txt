# Prehistoric Fish




## Dunkleosteus

These massive, armored fish were among the first monstrous apex predators to roam the primeval oceans of the world. The dunkleosteus could reach between 20 to 30 feet in length and weigh over a ton. They possessed boney armor across the front of their body, and though they didn't have teeth in the traditional sense, their armor formed into a beak-like structure made of two razor-sharp boney plates. Combined with the massive bite force, these sheering jaws could cut through the armor of its equally boney prey with ease. 

Though their heavy armor made them slower swimmers than most modern sea creatures, their methods of suction feeding allowed them to draw in prey before delivering their devastating bite.

Though they are believed to be extinct, some dunkleosteus may still lurk in lost seas cut off from the march of time. Through powerful magic, others may be brought back to life to terrorize the oceans once more. Should a dunkleosteus be brought into the service of a druid or other powerful being, it can be utilized as a devastating nautical tank, able to shred through heavily armored foes and ships alike with its sundering jaws.

## Megalodon
These titanic beasts are not only the greatest of all sharks but among the largest predators to have ever lived. The megalodon reached lengths of 50 to 60 feet, weighed over 60 tons, and had the most powerful bite of any beast to have ever lived. Their primary prey were whales and other large sea creatures, which they could kill with a single bite. 

Though they are no longer commonplace, there are scattered reports that some megalodons still rule deep, remote ocean locals. Some even claim that megalodons occasionally venture into waters populated with humanoids where they terrorize sailors and local sea life alike. Others believe megalodons aren't a natural species of shark but divine punishment sent by wrathful sea gods to devour ocean-going mortals.

Regardless of a megalodon's origin, sahuagin always see its arrival as the coming of a divine avatar sent by their shark god. A sahuagin king will take charge of the mighty megalodon and use it to rally a conquering army. The presence of a megalodon inspires terror in enemies and near unbreakable ferocity in sahuagin warriors. Such a force can spell doom for entire undersea kingdoms and take control of a whole sea's worth of ship trade.
