# Prehistoric Fish
The following creatures have forms and traits associated with rats found in nature, but nothing is natural about any of these monstrosities.  They may  have once been wild creatures twisted into abominations, or they may have entirely magical origins.  They may be isolated cases of monstrous rats or associated with a larger force of rat-like creatures.  In any case,  they are certain to terrorize any would-be adventures unfortunate enough to cross their path.

## Dunkleosteus
These monstrous rodents are thought to have once been giant rats subjected to twisted, mutating forces shortly after birth.  Their mutations grant them regenerative powers and rapid growth, which drives a ravenous hunger, leading the brood horror to devour all its litter mates and quickly grow beyond the size of a typical giant rat.  

A fully grown brood horror is a ravenous monster whose bloated body belies its incredible speed, which it uses to run down prey before snatching them up with its whip-like tail.  Subterranean races prize brood horrors as deadly mounts.  But, riding one is a dangerous proposition, for even if the brood horror doesn't devour its rider, should it be slain in combat, it will explode in a mass of poisonous filth deadly <br> to enemy and ally alike.
