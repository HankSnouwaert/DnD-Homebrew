>___
> ***Abyssal Hunter.*** The anglerfish has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide while in darkness and is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in darkness.
>
> ***Lure.*** The anglerfish has a lure attached to its head which it can extend up to 30 feet from itself as object interaction. The lure sheds dim light within a 20-foot radius. The lure follows the relative position of the anglerfish as it moves.
>
> ***Water Breathing.*** The anglerfish can breathe only underwater.
>
> ### Actions
>
>  ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage.
>
>  ***Vacuum Gulp*** The anglerfish sucks up the water in a 30-foot cone in front of it. Each creature in that area that is in the same body of water as the anglerfish must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled to the anglerfish. A creature pulled to the anglerfish takes 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage and is swallowed by the anglerfish if it is huge or smaller and the anglerfish has room in its stomach. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the anglerfish, and it takes 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage at the start of each of the anglerfish's turns. 
>
>If the anglerfish takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the anglerfish must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the anglerfish. The anglerfish can have up to 9 creatures swallowed at a time. Large creatures count as 4 creatures, and huge creatures count as 9. If the angler fish dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Flashing Lure (Recharge 5-6)*** Each creature within the light radius of the anglerfish's lure must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of the anglerfish's next turn. While blinded this way, a creature moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws and ability checks.
