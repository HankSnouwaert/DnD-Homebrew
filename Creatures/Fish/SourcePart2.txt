# Sea Fish: Part 2

## Anglerfish

Deep in the ocean's midnight depths, beyond the reach of any daylight, the sea life takes on a nightmarish aspect. No creature exemplifies this more than the anglerfish. Its demonic visage is made up of two beady black eyes sitting above a vast gaping maw filled with long, barbed teeth. Atop its bulbous body is its iconic lure, tipped with glowing light, which it uses to draw prey to itself in the otherwise lightless deep. 

***Sinister Beacon in the Dark.*** Luckily, ordinary anglerfish rarely reach more than a foot in length and are harmless to humanoid-sized creatures. They prey on sea creatures their size or smaller, using their light lure to attract these potential meals. The anglerfish appears as a beacon in the dark, with its shadowy form hidden from view. Once prey comes close enough, it opens its mouth wide, creating a powerful vacuum to pull in anything within range. After the victim is swallowed, the anglerfish's long interlocking teeth serve to bar any potential escape.

<br><br><br>

***Huge Appetites.*** Due to the scarcity of food in the deep, anglerfish move slowly to conserve energy and rarely pass up a meal. Even if the anglerfish has recently fed or the prospective meal is larger than them, it will make use of its ever-expanding gut to make room for the new meal. Anglerfish will gluttonously gulp up huge amounts of prey this way to provide nourishment over long periods of scarcity in the vast depths.

***Giant Anglerfish.*** While ordinary anglerfish are no threat to humanoids, their giant kin are a nightmarish danger to any who venture into the deep. They hunt larger creatures such as humanoids using the same tactics as ordinary anglerfish, and their lures can blind and disorient their prey, making escape even more difficult. These monstrous fish are one of the many reasons other sea-dwelling races fear venturing into the lightless depths, and many a would-be sea elf or triton explorer has met their end in the gullet of these abyssal horrors.

>___
> ***Abyssal Hunter.*** The anglerfish has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide while in darkness and is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in darkness.
>
> ***Lure.*** The anglerfish has a lure attached to its head which it can extend up to 30 feet from itself as object interaction. The lure sheds dim light within a 20-foot radius. The lure follows the relative position of the anglerfish as it moves.
>
> ***Water Breathing.*** The anglerfish can breathe only underwater.
>
> ### Actions
>
>  ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage.
>
>  ***Vacuum Gulp*** The anglerfish sucks up the water in a 30-foot cone in front of it. Each creature in that area that is in the same body of water as the anglerfish must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled to the anglerfish. A creature pulled to the anglerfish takes 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage and is swallowed by the anglerfish if it is huge or smaller and the anglerfish has room in its stomach. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the anglerfish, and it takes 24 (7d6) acid damage at the start of each of the anglerfish's turns. 
>
>If the anglerfish takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the anglerfish must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the anglerfish. The anglerfish can have up to 9 creatures swallowed at a time. Large creatures count as 4 creatures, and huge creatures count as 9. If the angler fish dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Flashing Lure (Recharge 5-6)*** Each creature within the light radius of the anglerfish's lure must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of the anglerfish's next turn. While blinded this way, a creature moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws and ability checks.

## Sawfish

These bizarre fish are easily recognized by their massive sawtoothed nose extensions, which usually make up between one-quarter to one-third of the animal's total length. Sawtooth fish come in a range of different sizes depending on the species, but they all use their sawtoothed extensions in the same ways.

***Bizzare Weaponry.*** The most obvious use of the sawfish's massive toothed nose is as a weapon. Sawfish will slice through their prey with rapid slashing motions of their saw. This tactic can be used in the open water and on the ocean floor, where they use the saw to pin and manipulate their targets. While sawfish don't actively hunt anything too large to fit into their relatively small mouths, when threatened, they can use their saws to inflict massive damage on would-be attackers and can even fend off shark attacks this way. Should a sea druid or other powerful being gain control of several sawfish, they can be used as a powerful aquatic strike force, slashing at foes from a distance while staying out of striking range.

\columnbreak

&emsp; ***Electroreceptive Antenna.*** The second, more subtle use of the saw appendage is as an electroreceptive tool. This saw contains thousands of sensory organs allowing the sawfish to detect the electrical fields of nearby creatures, enabling them to spot prey hidden beneath the sea floor and in murky water. This tool makes them difficult to sneak up on, and sea folk able to control sawtooth fish will often use them to scan the sea floor for hidden creatures when hunting.

## Stargazer

These bizarre fish reach lengths between one to two feet and possess large bulging eyes and a perpetually frowning mouth filled with interlocking needle-like teeth, which come together to form a disturbing face that perpetually points upwards, hence their name. Stargazers are capable diggers and hide by burrowing into the sandy ocean floor until only their upward pointing face is flush with the sandy surface. Here, they lie and wait until an unsuspecting creature comes within range. At that moment, the stargazer strikes in less time than it takes to blink an eye. The prey is snagged before it can react, pulled into the stargazer's gullet via powerful suction.

***Vicious Defences.*** Stargazers possess an array of natural weapons that make them unpleasant to contend with even when their hiding spots have been exposed. They have fines tipped with venomous spines, which they can use to threaten creatures that attack them from different angles. But, most bizarrely of all, stargazers can unleash a powerful electrical shock capable of deterring most would-be predators that touch them.

***Giant Stargazers.*** These horrifyingly huge fish prey on any creature smaller than themselves that ventures too close to their hiding spot, including humanoids. To make matters worse, they possess all the vicious defenses of ordinary stargazers but at a much larger scale, giving them a multitude of methods for slaying any foolish swimmers that tangle with this nightmarish fish. Someone traversing the sea floor may suddenly find themselves staring down at the creature's grizzly visage for a split second before being devoured in the blink of an eye, never to be heard from again.

## Stonefish

These fish derive their name from their penchant for camouflaging as rocks or coral on the sea floor, and they generally grow to just over two feet. Their camouflage can be quite elaborate, with a variety of colors and features that allow them to blend into their given environment. These environments tend to be reefs and rocky tide pools, and these disguises enable a stonefish to be nearly undetectable while it sits motionless on the sea floor. When prey draws close, it attacks at lightning speed, using suction to gulp down its meal almost instantaneously.  

***Deadliest of Fish.*** Stonefish hold the title of most venomous fish in the world. This venom is contained in dorsal spines hard enough to pierce the soul of a boot. 

Combine this with their excellent camouflage, and stonefish quickly becomes one of the creatures most hazardous to humanoids walking through shallow sea waters. If not treated quickly, wounds from this venom can prove fatal to those of weak constitution.

***Giant Stonefish.*** These fish disguise as large rocks and expanses of coral on the sea floor and prey on a huge range of creatures. Fishermen and divers are a favorite meal of the giant stonefish, and many such individuals may mysteriously go missing before people begin to suspect the presence of such a fish in nearby waters. Even those who initially survive their encounter with this monstrous creature may be inflicted with its horrific venom and later succumb to its agonizing effects.

## Swordfish

These strange yet elegant fish are easily recognized by their trademark noses which extend out like a long rapier. The aptly named swordfish is among the fastest swimmers in the world, and it combines this speed with tight maneuverability and its slashing bill to become one of the most effective hunters of the open ocean. The swordfish hunts other fish in open waters where there is nowhere to hide and no hope of outswimming such a high-speed attacker. Even swimming in schools does a fish little good, as the swordfish's slashing bill attacks allow it to cut through swaths of fish at a time.

\columnbreak

Swordfish generally reach 10 feet in length, though the largest specimens can reach 15 feet. Their size, speed, and deadly weapon make them formidable foes, though they generally have little interest in fighting other large creatures unless threatened. Swordfish are highly sought after by those with the ability to call upon the aid of sea creatures. When directed to attack foes this way, the swordfish can utilize its speed and reach to perform devastating hit-and-run attacks against their targets, and even those who flee to a rowboat may not be safe from the reach of their piercing swords.
