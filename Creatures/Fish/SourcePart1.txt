# Sea Fish: Part 1

## Barracuda
These fearsome creatures are among the most effective predatory fish in all the seas. The barracuda's long, stream-lined body can reach over 5 feet in length and is covered in silvery scales that make it difficult to spot in the water. Once it's gotten close enough to its prey without being spotted, it quickly closes the distance in a burst of speed. The barracuda's ambush tactics rarely give its targets the chance to react before being captured in its fanged jaws. Its barbed jaws make escape unlikely, and the trapped prey is quickly ripped apart.

**Aggressive Hunters.** Barracuda are voracious predators and will hunt most other sea creatures their size or smaller. They rarely attack humanoids without provocation unless visibility is poor, and they mistake glittering jewelry for a fish. However, if an unnatural influence is disturbing their home waters, the barracuda's natural aggression can lead it to attack anything and everything in sight. It may indiscriminately slaughter every fish it sees and even attack larger creatures in its confused state until the corrupting influence is cleared. Some barracuda may become permanently warped by these influences, taking on a supernatural appearance and dedicating their every moment to mad ocean slaughter.

**Giant Barracuda.** While most barracuda are little threat to humanoids, these massive fish are large enough to consider humanoids prey. Giant barracuda hunt using the same ambush tactics as their smaller kin and will often hunt divers and aquatic humanoids. Those able to control sea creatures will often use giant barracuda as the marine equivalent of hunting dogs and call upon them to slay or retrieve creatures of interest attempting to flee underwater.

**Giant Barracuda.** While most barracuda are little threat to humanoids, these massive fish are large enough to consider humanoids prey. Giant barracuda hunt using the same ambush tactics as their smaller kin and will often hunt divers and aquatic humanoids. Those able to control sea creatures will often use giant barracuda as the marine equivalent of hunting dogs and call upon them to slay or retrieve creatures of interest attempting to flee underwater.

**Schools of Barracuda.** While most barracuda become solitary hunters as they grow older, younger barracuda commonly form schools for protection and to more effectively hunt other schools of fish. These schools of barracuda generally ignore larger creatures unless subjected to unusual external influences, such as corrupted waters or the direct control of powerful druidic magic. Such schools can become highly aggressive and formidable foes, able to shred larger sea creatures and even groups of humanoids within a few bloody moments.

> ***Poisonous Barbs.*** Any creature that grapples the lionfish, starts its turn grappling it, or misses it with a weapon attack while within 5 feet of it takes 3 (1d6) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage. If the target is a medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the lionfish. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lionfish, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the lionfish's turns. The lionfish can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the lionfish dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 hour.

A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success or taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failure.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 24 hours. A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success or taking 7 (2d6) poison damage on a failure.

>
> ### Reactions
> ***Inflate***  When a creature attacks, attempts to shove, or successfully grapples the puffer fish while it is not inflated, it inflates itself, imposing disadvantage on the triggering attack or ability check. It then makes a sting attack against each creature within 5 feet of it. While inflated, its movement is reduced by 5 feet. It can use an action to end to deflate back to its normal state.

> ***Inflate***  When a creature attacks, attempts to shove, or successfully grapples the pufferfish while it is not inflated, it inflates itself, imposing disadvantage on the triggering attack or ability check. When it inflates, it attempts to grow its size to huge. If another creature occupies the space it would grow into, it makes a sting attack against that creature. If the attack hits, it pushes that creature 10 feet away. If it misses, it does not push the creature, and the pufferfish does not grow any larger. While inflated, its movement is reduced by 10 feet. It can use an action to end to deflate back to its normal state.
