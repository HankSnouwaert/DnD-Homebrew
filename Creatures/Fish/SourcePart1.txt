# Sea Fish: Part 1

## Barracuda
These fearsome creatures are among the most effective predatory fish in all the seas. The barracuda's long, stream-lined body can reach over 5 feet in length and is covered in silvery scales that make it difficult to spot in the water. Once it's gotten close enough to its prey without being spotted, it quickly closes the distance in a burst of speed. The barracuda's ambush tactics rarely give its targets the chance to react before being captured in its fanged jaws. Its barbed jaws make escape unlikely, and the trapped prey is quickly ripped apart.

**Aggressive Hunters.** Barracuda are voracious predators and will hunt most other sea creatures their size or smaller. They rarely attack humanoids without provocation unless visibility is poor, and they mistake glittering jewelry for a fish. However, if an unnatural influence is disturbing their home waters, the barracuda's natural aggression can lead it to attack anything and everything in sight. It may indiscriminately slaughter every fish it sees and even attack larger creatures in its confused state until the corrupting influence is cleared. Some barracuda may become permanently warped by these influences, taking on a supernatural appearance and dedicating their every moment to mad ocean slaughter.

**Giant Barracuda.** While most barracuda are little threat to humanoids, these massive fish are large enough to consider humanoids prey. Giant barracuda hunt using the same ambush tactics as their smaller kin and will often hunt divers and aquatic humanoids. Those able to control sea creatures will often use giant barracuda as the marine equivalent of hunting dogs and call upon them to slay or retrieve creatures of interest attempting to flee underwater.

**Giant Barracuda.** While most barracuda are little threat to humanoids, these massive fish are large enough to consider humanoids prey. Giant barracuda hunt using the same ambush tactics as their smaller kin and will often hunt divers and aquatic humanoids. Those able to control sea creatures will often use giant barracuda as the marine equivalent of hunting dogs and call upon them to slay or retrieve creatures of interest attempting to flee underwater.

**Schools of Barracuda.** While most barracuda become solitary hunters as they grow older, younger barracuda commonly form schools for protection and to more effectively hunt other schools of fish. These schools of barracuda generally ignore larger creatures unless subjected to unusual external influences, such as corrupted waters or the direct control of powerful druidic magic. Such schools can become highly aggressive and formidable foes, able to shred larger sea creatures and even groups of humanoids within a few bloody moments.

## Lionfish
These fish derive their name from their fearsome appearance and ferocious predatory behavior. Lionfish are voracious hunters and will devour nearly any creature smaller than them, even other lionfish. When approaching its prey, the lionfish launches a jet of water at the target, leaving it floundering. The lionfish quickly closes on its disoriented prey, gulping it down in one bite. Their effectiveness as hunters often leads them to dominate whatever ecosystem they find themselves in, and fishermen often make a habit of focusing their hunts on lionfish in an effort to keep their population under control.

The fact that so few predators are willing to trifle with a lionfish also makes their numbers difficult to control. Their large, brightly colored fins warn of their venomous nature, and they back this threat up with their long poisonous spines. These spines make them hazardous prey for most creatures, and humanoids jabbed by a lionfish can be left sickened for an extended period, though the poison is rarely fatal.

**Giant Lionfish.** Lionfish pose little threat to creatures larger than themselves, and so they are rarely of any concern to humanoids. Unless, of course, they find themselves facing a lionfish larger than themselves. Giant lionfish readily group most humanoids into the broad catagory of things to be preyed upon and hunt them the same way they hunt other fish. At their size, giant lionfish can deliver lethal doses of poison through their spines, shoot jets of water large enough to leave most humanoids floundering, and swallow said humanoids whole. Masses of giant lionfish can wreak havoc on a marine ecosystem, devouring not only all the wildlife but also all the aquatic humanoids and fisherman who traverse those waters.

The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lionfish, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the lionfish's turns. The lionfish can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the lionfish dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

(A creature knocked prone underwater is subjected to the effects of the prone condition as normal.)

## Pufferfish
These small, slow, awkward-looking fish are quite unassuming at first glance. Their beak-like mounts allow them to feed on hard-shelled mollusks, and they mostly keep to themselves, using their keen sight to spot and avoid predators. Should the pufferfish be unable to avoid a confrontation, it will deploy its unusual method of defense in which it inflates itself, ballooning to several times its normal size and projecting many needle-like spins outwards. This defense alone often prevents predators from closing their jaws around the pufferfish. Should the tactic succeed, the now spherical pufferfish can slowly bob away to safety before deflating back to its normal size.

While the pufferfish's unique and even comical inflationary ability is its most iconic trait, it is far from its only form of defense. Many pufferfish contain potent neurotoxins, which coat their skin and spines. A single pufferfish can have enough poison to kill 30 adult humans, and contact with its spines can be lethal. The poison can paralyze muscles and slow the heart, and even those that survive may be comatose for an extended time. Despite the lethality of these fish, some consider them a delicacy, and specially trained chefs will prepare pufferfish in a way that (hopefully) doesn't kill patrons.

**Giant Pufferfish.** All of the inherent dangers of an ordinary pufferfish are exponentially enhanced by its giant cousin. In their deflated state, they are already the size of most humanoids, and once they inflate, they can dwarf an ogre. A threatened giant pufferfish can quickly spell doom for any creatures that come too close and few sea creatures dare to hunt them.
Some cunning sea folk will keep them near their homes to ward off intruders. Particularly influential sea folk will even send them out to meet attacking warbands. Should the warriors be foolish enough to close in on the pufferfish, they will quickly be scattered and poisoned as it unleashes its explosive growth.
