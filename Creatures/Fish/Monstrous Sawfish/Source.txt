  ### Isonade Adventures
The following table provides some ways to introduce isonades into your games:


##### Isonade Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The players are journeying on a crowded ship to their next destination when they begin to notice that people are disappearing each night. |
|  2  |The players find a small fishing boat, apparently abandoned in stormy waters.  |
|  3  | An isonade uses a fisherman's floating body as bait to lure sailors within range of its hook.   |
|  4  |  A school of isonades has become adept at rapidly dismantling small boats, turning the crews into helpless meals. |
|  5  | Sailors and fishermen must pay tribute to a local sahuagin baron or become the target of his isonade.|
|  6  | A storm wash tides of sea water containing isonades into a port city's sewers. Now the isonades stalk under the city's streets, snatching lone pedestrians down sewer drains. |
