# Monstrous Sawfish
While ordinary sawfish can be dangerous when provoked, they rarely threaten humanoids and generally use their massive sawtoothed nose extension for hunting smaller fish. However, some sailors swear they've seen these creatures saw right through entire ships before devouring the helpless passengers. These sailors encountered no ordinary sea creature but a monstrous sawfish that specializes in cutting apart sea vessels and dismembering their crew.

***Ship Wrecker.*** When a monstrous sawfish attacks a ship, its highest priority is destroying enough portions of the vessel that it begins to sink. It can do this with terrifying efficiency, often sinking mighty vessels within seconds. The sawfish will only interrupt its ship destruction to attack other individuals actively posing a threat and reachable with its saw. Otherwise, the sawfish will wait until the ship is sinking before it begins preying on those aboard.

***Stuck Saws.*** When attacking particularly sturdy ship sections, the monstrous sawfish risks getting its saw stuck. While it can usually wrench itself free, it is left vulnerable while stuck this way, and brazen sailors may seize the opportunity to attack the sea monster while they can. However, those heedless of the danger it still poses may find themselves quickly dismembered as the sawfish pulls itself free and saws its attacker in half with one swift but brutal motion.

> ### Actions
>
> ***Saw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 24 (3d12 + 5) slashing damage. The target takes an additional 6 (1d12) slashing damage for each size above Medium it is. If it rolls a 1 on any of its damage dice and the target is a Huge or larger object, the saw embeds itself in the object, and the sawfish becomes restrained by it and unable to attack until it uses an action to free itself.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Arcing Swing.*** When the sawfish misses with its saw attack against a target creature or uses an action to break free of the restrained condition caused by a target object, it can immediately make a saw attack against a different target within 15 feet of the original target and within range of the attack.

&emsp;***Wrath of the Seas.*** Sailors debate the origin of these sea monsters. Many believe a vengeful ocean god created them to punish humanoids for possessing the hubris to think they could dominate the seas using puny marine vessels. Others believe they were bred by aquatic races resentful of the intrusion of land-dwellers in their domain. 

Whatever their origin, monstrous sawfish are often controlled by ocean deities and aquatic races who wish to unleash the wrath of the seas upon enemy ships. Once they are set upon by monstrous sawfish, whatever illusion of navel superiority the land-dwellers think they have is shattered as quickly as their ships. Should a full school of monstrous sawfish be brought to bear, it can spell doom for an entire fleet.
