# Angler Mimics
These bizarre monstrosities are a terrifying combination of shapeshifting mimics and deep-sea anglerfish. Though the only part of the angler mimic that can shapeshift is its lure, it can burrow to hide the rest of its massive body out of sight. The mimic then transforms its lure to appear as an object likely to attract attention. This object is commonly the form of a dead creature, but it could take a variety of appearances, such as a crate or chest. Once potential prey touches the lure, it becomes adhered to it, and the angler mimic reveals itself as it moves in for the kill.

In combat, the angler mimic can swing its lure into new victims to adhere them and prevent escape. The lure can even flash disorienting colors, making it difficult for victims to struggle free or even swim away. Once the angler mimic has prey ripe for devouring, it will open its mouth wide and create a massive vacuum, inhaling all creatures before it. The mimic is highly aggressive in its pursuit of fleeing prey and will charge creatures while inhaling, ensuring none escape its massive appetite.

>___
> ***Adhesive Lure***. The angler mimicâ€™s lure adheres to anything that it touches. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the lure is also grappled by the angle mimic (escape DC 18 ). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
>
> ***Aquatic Burrowing.*** The angler mimic can only burrow underwater.
>
> ***Burrowed Ambusher.*** While the angler mimic is buried at least 5 feet underground, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and while it is no more than 20 feet underground, it has unobscured vision above the surface.
>
> ***Keen Sight.*** The angler mimic has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> **Shifting Lure** The angler mimic has a lure attached to its head which it can move anywhere within 30 feet of itself as an object interaction. It can polymorph the lure into a medium object which may shed dim light out to 20 feet as part of this object interaction. The lure can't be extended through a space too small to fit a medium object. The lure follows the relative position of the angler mimic as it moves. The lure immediately returns to the angler mimic's location if there is no opening at least 1 foot wide between its body and the lure. 
>
>For all practical purposes, the lure is the angler mimic, meaning that the angler mimic occupies its space and the lure's space simultaneously. However, the lure has its own AC of 16 and a HP pool of 200 hit points. The lure is destroyed if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if the angler mimic dies. If an effect targets only a single creature, any damage it deals is only dealt to the angler mimic or its lure (whichever was targeted.)
>
> ***Water Breathing.*** The angler mimic can breathe only underwater.
>
> ### Action
>
>  ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage.
>
> ***Lure Grab.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target within 5 feet of its lure. *Hit:* 11 (1d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
>
>  ***Vortex Vacuum.*** Until the start of the angler mimic's next turn, it sucks up the water in a 15-foot cone in front of it. During this time, the cone moves with the angler mimic, the angler mimic can't change the direction it's facing, and the angler mimic can only move forward in that direction. The cone is suppressed while the angler mimic is incapacitated.
> 
> The first time each turn the cone overlaps with a creature in the same body of water as the angler mimic, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled to the angler mimic. A creature pulled to the angler mimic takes 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage and is swallowed by the anglerfish if it is Huge or smaller and the angler mimic has room in its stomach. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the angler mimic, and takes 24 (7d6) acid damage at the start of each angler mimic's turns.
> 
> If the angler mimic takes 30 damage or more on a single turn, and none of it is dealt to its lure, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or end the effects of its cone and regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of it. The angler mimic can have up to 9 creatures swallowed at a time. Large creatures count as 4 creatures, and Huge creatures count as 9. If the angler mimic dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The angler mimic can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The angler mimic regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Check.** The angler mimic makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Redirect Vacuum** The angler mimic changes the direction of its vortex vacuum.
>
> **Rush.** The angler mimic moves up to half its movement. During this movement, its speed can't be reduced, and it can't be knocked prone.
>
>  **Tenacious Will.** If the angler mimic is suffering an effect that requires it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage, ending the effect on a success. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Flashing Lure (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within the light of the angler mimic's lure must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of the angler mimic's next turn. While blinded this way, the creature moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws and checks.
>
> **Lure Swing (Costs 2 Actions).** The angler mimic moves its lure without provoking opportunity attacks. It can make a Lure Grab attack before or after this movement.
