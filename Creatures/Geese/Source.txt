# Geese
Small, elegant, and unassuming, these waterfowl are a common sight at parks, ponds, and even small town squares. Geese congregate in large, migratory flocks and generally don't reach sizes much longer than 3 feet or weigh much more than 10 pounds. But, despite their small stature and lack of obvious natural weapons, these fearsome fowl are known to terrorize creatures many times their size.

***Terror of the Ponds.***  While geese lack the true combat abilities of many deadlier creatures, they are often able to make up for it through sheer stubborn confidence. A goose is not easily frightened and will even stand its ground against adversaries as menacing as rhinos.  

When they combine this stubbornness with a fearsome display of honking and flapping, geese can often send huge creatures running in fear. This can lead to geese taking over entire parks and driving townsfolk out of their own village squares.

***Goose Attacks.***  While geese don't possess the most deadly of natural weapons, a furious goose makes the most of what it has at its disposal. Small nips from their beaks are common and generally more annoying than anything else. But a goose unleashing a full assault combines bites with furious strikes from their wings and raking claws attacks to their target's face. Even if the onslaught does minor damage, it is often enough to break the resolve of the creature, sending the goose's victim fleeing in terror.

&emsp;***Gaggles of Geese.***  While an individual goose <br> is generally not dangerous, a group of geese, <br> known as a gaggle, can be a terrifying and <br> formidable threat. A gaggle that has identified <br> one or more creatures as an enemy will <br> relentlessly swarm its victims, bombarding <br> them with a never-ending slew of nips, wing <br> attacks, and claws to the face. A gaggle of <br> geese that has been driven to view all <br> humanoids as threats could easily conquer a <br> small park and terrorize a whole village, <br> sending all its residents fleeing to their homes <br> for safety from the fowl assault.

***Low Tier Druidic Guardians.***  Sometimes, a <br> druidic apprentice will be tasked with watching <br> over a minor natural feature, such as a pond, <br> park, or stream. Druids often receive aid from <br> local animals in carrying out their guardianship, <br> with more powerful druids able to call on the <br> aid of more powerful creatures. However, these <br> druids in training must rely on more modest <br> animals and often turn to geese to aid them in the <br> protection of their charges. These geese will fiercely <br> defend the druid and their charge, ruthlessly driving  <br>out intruders on sight.  

If there is a humanoid settlement nearby and the druid feels spiteful, malicious, or perhaps just bored, the geese may be sent to harass and attack the settlement's inhabitants. These incidents are more common than most will admit, and an embarrassing number of adventuring careers have been ended prematurely by malevolent gaggles of geese.

***Paragons of Halfling Bravery.*** Halflings feel a special kinship with geese. Both enjoy quiet pastoral lives and are small and unassuming. But both can also call upon their innate stubborn bravery to overcome seemingly impossible odds. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Halflings view geese in much the same way humans view lions, and they often incorporate goose iconography into icons associated with combat and courage.  Halflings encourage geese to stay in and around their villages, believing them to bring good luck. This belief is not entirely unfounded, as there are many tales of attacks on halfling villages being foiled by a sudden uprising of the local goose population.

## Giant Flightless Goose

Thought lost to the mists of time, these ancient <br> creatures are distant relatives to the modern goose <br> and can be found terrorizing the world's primeval <br> ponds and rivers. Standing 5 feet tall, these geese <br> lack the ability to fly but make up for it with their size <br> and fierce wing attacks. While they are thought to be <br> long extinct, travelers visiting remote rivers and time <br> lost islands may stumble across long-lost colonies of <br> these bizarre creatures.

***Flightless Pugilists.*** These geese have given up <br> the ability to fly, but in return, they've gained a more formidable size advantage and more devastating <br> natural weapons. Not only are their bites more <br> powerful, but their wings have transformed from a <br> means of flying into pure weapons intended for <br> delivering bone-breaking punches. Each wing ends <br> in a large bony knob, which the goose uses to deliver powerful strikes to rival geese, would-be predators, <br> and anyone else intruding on its territory. A united <br> gaggle of these beasts is usually more than enough <br> to send other creatures fleeing in terror, and those <br> who stand their ground will be subjected to an <br> unrelenting flurry of punches and bites.

***Amphibious Mounts.*** Some small, remote <br> woodland folk who live around sources of fresh <br> water will make use of giant geese as riding <br> animals. Though they lack the land speed of other <br> creatures,  their amphibious nature makes them <br> useful for quickly traversing various types of terrain. <br> Remote halfling villages, forest gnomes, and even <br> some fey will befriend these creatures, thereby  <br> gaining useful mounts and fierce guardians.  


Halflings, in particular, hold a special reverence <br> for these creatures, believing giant geese to be heroic <br> steeds sent by their gods to aid them in times of dire <br> need. There are many halfling folk tales which tell of <br> mighty heroes accomplishing great deeds upon their <br> brave and noble goose steed.

## Golden Goose

This enigmatic fey creature would appear to be a normal goose if not for the golden coloration radiating a faint magical glow, giving away its supernatural nature. These creatures can be wonderful gifts and companions to those who've won the favor of fey lords and the bane of those who would greedily attempt to snatch the goose for themselves.

**Selective Fey.**  Golden geese may be given as gifts by fey lords or simply choose companions of their own accord. In either case, if someone who hasn't earned the favor of the goose attempts to steal it, they may find the enchanted bird impossible to move. Worse yet, they may find themselves magically adhered to their would-be prize, helplessly dragged where ever to goose goes.  

**Prized Eggs.** The most prized attribute of the golden goose is its ability to lay magical golden eggs. Each of these eggs is made of enchanted gold and fetches a handsome price on the market. Most valuable are the supernatural eggs they can produce once per year. It is said that anyone who swallows one of these eggs will be cured of any aliment they are suffering from, supernatural or otherwise. As such, the retrieval of these eggs is often the focus of entire quests.

<br>

> ##### Golden Eggs
> The golden goose can lay a golden egg worth 100g once every 2d4+1 days. Once a year, the goose can lay a special egg which is a magic item worth 500g that can be consumed to cure one disease, poison or curse.

## Mischievous Goose
Though geese excel at disrupting the daily lives of humanoids, they are simple creatures.  Their disruptions are limited to chasing, honking, and sometimes attacking those who draw their ire.  But occasionally, a goose of extraordinary intelligence and guile will visit a village and bring with it a slew of mischievous disruptions, thefts, and sabotages.

**Random Acts of Mischief.** Though these geese have no official title, they all share a common aptitude for causing disruptions in the lives of others.  Their intelligence is far and above that of a typical goose, and they are known for their ability to sneak, steal, and escape from most humanoids with surprising ease.  Mischievous geese use these abilities to achieve a seemingly random variety of arbitrary tasks.  These tasks may involve something as simple as stealing and hoarding matching sets of items to elaborate tasks resulting in people injuring themselves in embarrassing ways, becoming trapped in buildings, or seeing their belonging destroyed.  These disruptions usually aren't dangerous, and the greatest injuries the goose's victims receive are to their pride.

**Agents of Chaos.**  Sometimes, a fey creature, druid, or even a god of trickery will develop a grudge against a particular village that they feel has wronged them.  As a petty means of enacting revenge, a mischievous goose will be summoned and unleashed upon the unsuspecting townsfolk, ruining all of their day plans.  Particularly unfortunate villages might be infiltrated by multiple mischievous geese, leaving the whole town in chaos.
