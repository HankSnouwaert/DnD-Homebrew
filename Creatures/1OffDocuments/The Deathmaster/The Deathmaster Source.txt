## The Deathmaster

Only the most skilled, cunning, and ruthlessly determined ninja ratfolk can obtain the title of deathmaster. This ratfolk is the paragon of its art, possessed of unbreakable discipline and unrivaled deadliness. Only one ratfolk holds the title of deathmaster at any given time, and the position is highly sought after by master assassins. 

The deathmaster is tasked with only the most vital missions whose success has grand strategic implications for the ratfolk clans at large. No mortal is safe from the deathmaster's reach, whether they be a mighty warlord, paranoid wizard, or powerful monarch secure in a supposedly impregnable fortress. 

In combat, the deathmaster flies in and out of the fray, dispatching foes before disappearing into the shadows, only to launch another attack from an unexpected angle. It wields a deadly weeping blade in each hand and a third with its tail, turning it into a whirlwind of death. Foes who try to pin down the deathmaster find that it can escape from any restraints before disappearing into the darkness using its cloak of shadows. The last thing most pursuers see is the glint of acid-coated blades as the deathmaster unleashes a fatal counterattack.

> ##### Optional Rule: Smoke Bombs
>In place of an attack as part of an Attack action, the deathmaster can throw a smoke grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. The grenade emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area within a 20-foot radius of where it lands. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.
>
> The deathmaster can use its action to throw a smoke grenade while frightened by its Scurry Away feature.
