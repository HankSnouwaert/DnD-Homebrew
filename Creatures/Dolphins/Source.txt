# Dolphins
Intelligent, agile, and playful; what dolphins lack in physical power, they make up for with their cunning, agility, and teamwork.  Add to this their unerring echolocation, and they become extremely difficult to outmaneuver or avoid.  

Though they lack the natural weapons of other sea creatures, when pressed into combat, dolphins are capable of delivering ramming attacks that can disorient their opponents.  When combined with their speed and extreme senses, these attacks make dolphins excellent at hit-and-run attacks.
