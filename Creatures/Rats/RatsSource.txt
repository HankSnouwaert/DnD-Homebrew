# Rats
These verminous rodents are the most well-known and infamous of their kind.  Though rats are not inherently evil and can even be kept as pets, they are strongly associated with disease and ruin.  In urban environments, they are notorious for spreading plagues and devouring food stores.  Cities that fail to keep the rat population in check will soon be overwhelmed with rats scurrying through sewers and between houses.  Fiends, fey, and wielders of dark magic will often utilize rats as familiars and spies and may even use them to start deadly epidemics.


**Strength in Numbers.**
Rats are not known for their strength or ferocity, and individually they pose little threat.  Under most circumstances, threatened rats will quickly become frightened and scurry away from danger into the safety of small nooks and crannies.  Rats are more likely to become emboldened when working in large numbers, and a hungry group of rats may become desperate enough to attack larger creatures who appear vulnerable.  When they attack en mass this way, rats can quickly overwhelm their prey, allowing them to tear apart creatures many times their size.

**Rats of Unusual Size.** Occasionally, rats can reach sizes far beyond that of a typical specimen.  These rodents may be members of entirely different species or the result of magical mutations, but the end result is the same.  Their larger size increases their boldness in the face of humanoids and other larger creatures, whom they are more likely to see as food than their smaller kin.  Though they still possess the same cowardice and need to congregate in large numbers as normal rats, these larger rodents are much more likely to be aggressive towards humanoids, and they may even take to hunting villagers and travelers.

These enormous rodents can be found stalking caverns, lurking in abandoned buildings, or scurrying deep through city sewers.  They may also be found in service of hags or subterranean races such as kobolds or goblins.  The most common variety is the giant rat, which can reach the size of coyotes.  However, some monstrous rats are as size as timber wolfs and can easily hunt prey their size and larger.  These rodents can serve as disturbing war beasts for unsavory masters.

**Vermin Tide.** Rats operate most effectively in large numbers.  Nothing demonstrates this more clearly than the formation of a rat swarm.  This congregation of rodents behaves as a single entity, allowing many individually weak rats to suddenly become a serious threat.  Rat swarms may occur naturally if enough rats gather in one concentrated space, or they may result from magical manipulation.  Druids or witches may exert their influence over colonies of rats, whipping them into frenzied swarms to overwhelm their enemies.

If enough rats come together, they may form a dreaded rat tide.  These massive swarms can overwhelm groups of armed soldiers and strip them to the bone in moments.  They may arise in cities overrun with hungry rats, or they might be summoned by powerful dark magic, or they could be unleashed as a form of divine wrath upon a doomed town.

If there are no swarms of rats within 10 feet of the rat queen below full health, it instead creates a **rat swarm** in an unoccupied space within 10 feet with a number of hit points equal to half the number rolled.  The new swarm has its own initiative and goes right before the rat queen.

> ### Reactions

> ***Rally Screech.*** When rat queen takes damage, it lets out a screech, causing all allied rats within 100 feet of it to be cured of all effects causing the charmed or frightened conditions.
