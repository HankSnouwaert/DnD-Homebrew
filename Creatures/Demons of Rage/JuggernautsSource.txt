If the juggernaut moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before hitting, the target takes an extra 9 (2d8) piercing damage, and, if the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the juggernaut can make one Pulverizing Stomp attack against it as a bonus action. NOTE: Does knocking the target prone require the charge?

### Juggernaut Tactics
Juggernauts serve as shock cavalry, often mounted by bloodletters. In combat, a juggernaut charges targets to knock them prone and stomp them. It will then stay in melee range to keep its prey from fleeing without risking an opportunity attack. At the start of its next turn, if the juggernaut has 30 or more hit points, it will back up and charge the target again.

#### Searing Juggernauts
Searing juggernauts prefer to engage groups of enemies, maximizing the impact of their Mantle of Immolation. They are most effective when paired with creatures that deal fire damage. Since the Mantle of Immolation can be triggered once per turn, a searing juggernaut can activate this ability on its own turn with its Gore or Pulverizing Stomp attacks (Note: Gore doesn't do fire damage). 


### Juggernaut Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Juggernaught Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
