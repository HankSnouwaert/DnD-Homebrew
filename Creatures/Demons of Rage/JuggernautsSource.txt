## Juggernauts

These infernal constructs are not born of flesh but are forged in the hellish fires of their fiendish realm, their bodies a horrific blend of demon spirit and enchanted metal. Encased in armor that is as much a part of them as their sinew and bone, these juggernauts bear the unholy symbols of their patrons, radiating malevolence and the promise of doom. Their eyes, ablaze with the fires of chaos, seek out the souls of the living with a hunger that is as eternal as the gods they serve. On the battlefield, these demonic engines serve as mounts for the mightiest of demonic warriors, their combined fury an unstoppable force of destruction.

In the throes of battle, juggernauts are a horrifying sight to behold. Their armored forms are impervious to all but the most powerful blows, making them virtually invincible to the common soldier. With each thunderous step, they cause the earth itself to tremble, sowing fear and chaos in the hearts of their foes. These beasts do not simply fight; they obliterate, crushing enemy lines under their massive hooves and goring the survivors with their razor-sharp horns. The bond between a juggernaut and its rider is forged in the crucible of war and chaos, creating a synergy of violence and rage that few can withstand.

Only the mightiest of warriors and demons are deemed worthy to mount these colossal beasts as steeds. To earn the right to ride a juggernaut is to be recognized as a champion of the demonic forces of rage, a living symbol of their favor, and a vessel of their destructive will. The bloody path to earning such a devastating steed is fraught with peril, for it requires a warrior or demon of exceptional strength, will, and devotion to the dark powers. Those who succeed are granted unparalleled power on the battlefield, their names feared and revered in equal measure. The sight of these fearsome riders atop their juggernaut steeds is a portent of doom , heralding an unstoppable onslaught of demonic rage.

***Searing Juggernauts.*** These infernal constructs radiate an aura of intense, searing heat, which causes the air around them to shimmer with the heat of a thousand flames. This aura not only incinerates the flesh of their foes but also makes everything in their vicinity far more susceptible to fire. This unique ability synergizes devastatingly with the fiery attacks of their allies, allowing even the smallest spark to erupt into a raging inferno. In the midst of battle, searing juggernauts are akin to moving epicenters of firestorms, where their mere presence ensures that the battlefield becomes a fiery hellscape.

##### Juggernaut Adventures

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Juggernaut of War:** The players find a keep besieged by a force of demonic rage led by a fearsome warlord atop a juggernaut. The adventurers are part of a desperate mission to infiltrate the army and eliminate the warlord and his steed in hopes of breaking the siege.|
|  2  |**The Juggernaut Blade:** Rumors have surfaced of a weapon capable of controlling or destroying juggernauts, last seen in the hands of a notorious demon-worshiping cult. The adventurers are tasked with finding and resting the weapon from their grip before they can muster a juggernaut attack force.    |
|  3  |**Juggernaut Hunt:** A powerful warlord has announced a juggernaut hunt where champions from across the harsh badlands seek to prove their worth by capturing or slaying a juggernaut in the nearby demonic wastes. The adventurers, drawn by the promise of glory and riches, must not only face the demonic beasts of the wastes but also rival hunters. |
|  4  | **Forest in Flames:** Within a remote forest, several searing juggernauts being ridden by bloodrenders rampage through the woods, setting the trees ablaze and hunting the forest elves within who are desperate for help in stopping the demons before their home is reduced to ash. |

### Juggernaut Tactics
Juggernauts serve as shock cavalry, often mounted by bloodletters. In combat, a juggernaut charges targets to knock them prone and stomp them. It will then stay in melee range to keep its prey from fleeing without risking an opportunity attack. At the start of its next turn, if the juggernaut has 30 or more hit points, it will back up and charge the target again.

#### Searing Juggernauts
Searing juggernauts prefer to engage groups of enemies, maximizing the impact of their Mantle of Immolation. They are most effective when paired with creatures that deal fire damage. Since the Mantle of Immolation can be triggered once per turn, a searing juggernaut can activate this ability on its own turn with its Gore or Pulverizing Stomp attacks and on the enemies turn if the creature ends it's in the juggernaut aura. 


### Juggernaut Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check.

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Juggernaut Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
