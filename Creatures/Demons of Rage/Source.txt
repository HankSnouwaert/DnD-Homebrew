# Demons of Rage
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness, but none are so brutal as the demons of rage.  These demons are born from the innate aggression of mortals, and thrive in times of war.  They are the living embodiments of rage, bloodlust, and warmongering.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently, rampaging across existence in their endless desire for battle and bloodshed.  On others, they serve as soldiers to one or more mighty demon lords or demonic gods who preside over the domains of rage, blood, and conquest.     

***Call to War.*** While most demons are known for brutality and murder, demons of rage embody these aspects in their purest form.  War and aggression are their succor, and these fiends incite mortals into bloody conflict wherever they roam.  While demons of rage are more than eager enough to wage war directly, their presence alone drives mortals to greater levels of aggression and brutality.  Under the influence of these demons, armies lose all restraint, once peaceful villages are consumed in bloody riots, and people across the land rally for war.

<br>

&emsp;***Brutal and Direct.***  Demons of rage eschew indirect tactics such as guile, deception, or sorcery.  They view these methods as a sign of weakness and despise all who employ them.  Demons of rage engage their enemies head-on, relying on overwhelming aggression and superior strength at arms to crush their foes.  While these fiends are not stupid and possess masterful skills in combat, they rarely allow the niceties of complex battlefield tactics to interfere with their need for brutal slaughter.

***Hatred of Magic.***  While many demons utilize innate arcane abilities to achieve their depraved ends, demons of rage condemn the use of magic.  To them, spellcraft is a cowardly and despicable substitute for martial prowess, and these demons only utilize magic in the form of enchanted arms and armor.  The disdain for magic these demons hold is reflected in how easily they can shrug off any sorcery that would attempt to subdue them.  Demons of rage have an innate resistance to magical effects, and they often forge armaments that help them negate any spells that would deny them glorious, unimpeded combat.

***Bloodletters.***  These demonic warriors sport massive horns, blood-red hides, and a skull-like visage whose eyes burn with endless rage.  Bloodletters wield mighty hellblades with brutal skill and often serve as demonic footsoldiers.  They attack with unrestrained brutality, feeding off the aggression and violence of combat.  Bloodletters fighting together will drive each other to greater heights of hatred, cutting through enemies in a maddened frenzy

Bloodletters often make up the bulk of demonic armies in service to demon lords of war and hatred.  In some worlds, they slaughter in the name of a specific master, while in others, they serve as demonic footsoldiers utilized by multiple demon lords.  

Bloodletters are often encountered in small roving warbands but can sometimes form the backbone of world-ending demonic armies.   While they are deadly and unrelenting warriors, their single-minded need for slaughter usually prohibits them from performing complex long-term strategies.  For bloodletters, combat is an end unto itself.

***Blood Thirsters.*** 
These greater demons are the <br> mightiest embodiments of war and hatred in <br> existence.  They tower over the battlefield, <br> snarling hound-like faces striking terror in the <br> enemy as their mighty wings carry them into melee <br> range. When blood thirsters move across land, they <br> devastate the earth itself with their presence, each <br> step rending the ground and leaving a burning trail <br> of hellfire.  Once in striking distance, they cut a swath  <br>through their foes with massive demonic blades, <br> slaughtering entire regiments of enemies in a few <br> bloody moments.

Blood thirsters act as fiendish warlords, often <br> leading demonic armies in search of glory and <br> slaughter.  They may serve more powerful demonic <br> entities or act independently, but in either case, they <br> often command lesser demons of rage.  While the <br> chaotic nature of demons usually prevents them <br> from organizing in sophisticated ways, blood <br> thirsters possess a brutal authority and instinct for <br> battle tactics, allowing them to direct their murderous <br> hordes to execute sophisticated tactics beyond their typical capabilities.  Once battle is joined, the presence of the blood thirster alone is enough to drive all combatants into a frenzy.  Once orderly soldiers quickly succumb to chaotic bloodlust, and all restraint is swept away in the whirlwind of war.

> ***Magic Resistance.*** The blood thirster has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Spell Breaker*** At the start of each of the blood thirster's turns, it can end one spell of 6th level or lower of its choice affecting it or a creature within 10 feet of it that it can see. It can do this even while incapacitated.
>
> ***The Land Rebels.*** The blood thirster ignores difficult terrain.  Additionally, any ground the blood thirster moves through becomes difficult terrain and is set ablaze with fire for the next minute.  Any non-demon creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, takes the 10(3d6) fire damage.
>
> ***Weapons of Fury.*** Any weapon the bloodthirster is wielding becomes magical for long as it wields it, and blood thirster can't be disarmed of the weapon.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Aggressive.*** The blood thirster moves up to its speed toward a hostile creature it can see.
>
> ***Cleave.***  When the blood thirster reduces a creature to 0 hit points with its Greataxe of Fury on its turn, it can make another attack with this weapon.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The blood thirster makes three attacks.
>
> ***Greataxe of Fury.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) slashing damage. If the target is concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain concentration resulting from this attack.
>
> ***War Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage. The target must make a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet towards the blood thirster.
>
> ***Whirlwind of Rage.*** The blood thirster makes a Greataxe of Fury attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target. The area within 10 feet of the bloodthirster is then affected by its The Land Rebels feature.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Vengeful Charge.*** When the blood thirster is hit by an attack or a creature cast a spell that forces it to make a saving throw to resist its effects, the blood thirster can move up to half its speed towards the creature without provoking opportunity attacks. The blood thirster can then make a melee weapon attack against that creature with advantage if it is within 10 feet of it.

***Flesh Hounds.*** These fiends are literal dogs of war.  They have the appearance of blood-red canines with demonic features whose fanged maws glow with infernal heat.  They charge across the field of battle in bloodthirsty hunting packs, constantly searching for their next victims.  The demonic howl of a flesh hound boils the air, cooking entire regiments of foes in an instant.  Wounded survivors are then set upon with claws and teeth capable of crushing through armor, and any who attempt to flee are quickly hunted down and ripped to bloody shreds.

Flesh hounds are often used as beasts of war and hunting dogs by demonic masters.  Unfortunate souls who have earned the ire of such a demon may find themselves pursued by these tireless hunters.  For once a flesh hound gets the scent of its prey, it does not rest until its quarry's mangled body is delivered to its master.

To ensure no magic interferes with the flesh hound's hunt, each fiend is fitted with a runic collar that wards off spellcraft.  Flesh hounds have a special hatred for magic users and are trained to prioritize the slaughter of such individuals.  In battle, demonic commanders often use flesh hounds as anti-magic minions, utilizing their mobility and magic resistance to quickly run down and shred enemy mages before they can interfere with combat.
