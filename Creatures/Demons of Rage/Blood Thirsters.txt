### Arsenal of Rage

The blood thirster can be equipped with any of the following two weapons:

 ***Greataxe of Fury.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or take 13 (3d8) force damage. If it fails by 10 or more, it takes 27 (6d8) force damage instead. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this force damage dies.

**Skull Mace.*** Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. When the blood thirster damages a creature concentrating on a spell, the DC for the saving throw to maintain its concentration is 21 instead of the normal 10 or half the damage received.

 **Slaughter Blade. (1/turn)** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage. Once per turn, when the blood thirster makes this attack, it may then make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature within 10 feet of the original target and within range of the weapon as part of the same action.

***War Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage. The target must make a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet toward the blood thirster. If the creature fails the save by 10 or more, it is knocked prone.

#### Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

### Blood Thirster Tactics
Blood thirsters excel as melee brutes and possess formidable resistance to magic thanks to their Magic Resistance and Spell Breaker traits. Their ability to fly, coupled with their aggressive nature, allows them to easily reach their desired targets. Although they can fly, blood thirsters usually prefer ground combat so that they can make use of their Land Rebels trait.

#### Blood Thirster Weapons
Blood thirsters can choose from four different weapons, each tailored to overcome specific types of opponents:

**Greataxe of Fury:** This weapon is the highest damage-dealing option for blood thirsters and is particularly effective against foes with lower Strength.

**Skull Mace:** This weapon is best for dealing with spellcasters.

**Slaughter Blade:** This is the best option for dealing with enemies that tend to group up.

**War Whip:** This is a versatile weapon. It can pull in enemies who attempt to avoid melee combat, position creatures for a Slaughter Blade strike, or pull in a spellcaster for a Skull Mace attack.

#### Blood Thirster Reactions
Blood thirsters have two available reactions:

**Vengeful Strike:** This reaction is generally the preferred choice for blood thirsters as it carries less risk.

**Wrathful Counter:** Blood thirstiers opt for this reaction when they have received disadvantage on attack rolls, are unable to move, or have strong reason to believe an enemy spellcaster is about to cast a 6th-level or higher spell. Note that the blood thirstiers lack advanced knowledge of the specific spell being cast, and it's up to the Dungeon Master to determine whether this reaction is used at the start of the player's turn. (NOTE: I'm not sure what this last sentence means.)

#### Exalted Blood Thirsters
The primary difference with exalted blood thirsters is that they possess legendary actions, with their two primary legendary actions used as follows:

**Hellfire Breath:** The exalted blood thirster uses this action whenever it can hit three or more opponents at once.

**Head Bash:** This action is used when there aren't enough targets for Hellfire Breath or when there's an opponent causing a significant amount of trouble for the Blood Thirster. A strategic combination is for the Blood Thirster to use Vengeful Strike to close the distance to the desired target and then utilize Head Bash on the same turn.

\columnbreak

### The Bloody Fist
The Bloody Fist's most unique trait is its ability to inflict bloody wounds on its targets, which is complimented by its Goreshell reaction. Its main goal is to whittle down foes with wounds while sustaining itself with Goreshell. 

The following tactics can maximize The Bloody Fist's effectiveness:

**Stacking Wounds.** Stack as many wounds on a single target as possible.

**Enemy Healers.** Prioratize taking down anyone capable of casting healing spells at 5th-level or higher.

**Serrated Whip.** This can pull enemies across the blood spikes, causing a massive number of wounds on a target. The Bloody Fist should take any opportunity to use this combo, even if the pulled creature isn't its primary target.

**Switching Targets.** If the Bloody Fist's primary target becomes heavily protected by its allies, who expend significant resources to prevent further wounds, it should switch targets. The Bloody Fist will start inflicting wounds on a new foe, aiming to divert the party's attention.

**Hemorrhaging Roar.** This should be used if it can hit a group of targets who have a total of 9 wounds among them.

### Blood Thirster Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Blood Thirster Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
