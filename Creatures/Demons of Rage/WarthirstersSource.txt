## Warthirsters
These greater demons are the mightiest embodiments of war and hatred in existence. They tower over the battlefield, snarling fiendish faces striking terror in the enemy as their mighty wings carry them into melee range. When warthirsters move across land, they devastate the earth itself with their presence, each step rending the ground and leaving a burning trail of hellfire.  Once in striking distance, they cut a swath through their foes with massive demonic blades, slaughtering entire regiments of enemies in a few bloody moments.

Despite their savage appearance, warthirsters are paragons of martial skill able to wield any melee weapon with unparalleled mastery. They can bring a variety of weapons to bear against their enemies. The most common of these weapons are their mighty great axes, capable of felling mighty foes in a single strike, and their burning war whips, which can pull in any craven enemies who attempt to flee the warthirster's fury. 

Spellcasters are usually the first to draw the warthirster's ire, and warthirsters have an innate ability to cut through any magic that would interfere with "honorable" hand-to-hand combat. Most spellcasters find their magic rendered ineffective before becoming a bloodstain smeared across the battlefield.

Warthirsters act as fiendish warlords, often leading demonic armies in search of glory and slaughter. They may serve more powerful demonic entities or act independently, but in either case, they often command lesser demons of rage.  While the chaotic nature of demons usually prevents them from organizing in sophisticated ways, warthirsters possess a brutal authority and instinct for battle tactics, allowing them to direct their murderous hordes to execute sophisticated tactics beyond their typical capabilities.  Once battle is joined, the presence of the warthirster alone is enough to drive all combatants into a frenzy.  Once orderly soldiers quickly succumb to chaotic bloodlust, and all restraint is swept away in the whirlwind of war.

The mightiest of warthirsters who achieve the greatest levels of conquest and bloodshed are sometimes elevated to the status of exalted warthirsters. This is a rare occurrence for the warthirster must prove itself as a paragon of combat and a brutal warlord able to lead warmongering hordes to untold levels of victory and glorious bloodshed. Those who prove worthy become the most powerful demons of rage in existence, leading even greater legions of their bloodthirsty brethren on mighty campaigns of war and slaughter across the cosmos.

### Arsenal of Rage

The warthirster can be equipped with any of the following two weapons:

 ***Greataxe of Fury.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or take 13 (3d8) force damage. If it fails by 10 or more, it takes 27 (6d8) force damage instead. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this force damage dies.

***Skull Mace.*** Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. When the warthirster damages a creature concentrating on a spell, the DC for the saving throw to maintain its concentration is 21 instead of the normal 10 or half the damage received.

 ***Slaughter Blade. (1/turn)*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 23 (3d10 + 7) slashing damage. Once per turn, when the warthirster makes this attack, it may then make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature within 10 feet of the original target and within range of the weapon as part of the same action.

***War Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage. The target must make a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet toward the warthirster. If the creature fails the save by 10 or more, it is knocked prone.

### The Bloody Fist
This warthirster has gained legendary notoriety not just for his brutal capabilities but his cruel cunning and unusually high levels of patience. Unlike other demons of rage who recklessly charge headlong into enemies with the intention of slaughtering them all as quickly as possible, The Bloody Fist prefers cunning surgical strikes to cripple foes before wearing them down through prolonged combat. Forces led by The Bloody Fist are likely to cut off an enemy's supply lines, burn any land they could live off of, and then whittle them down through attrition.

Though The Bloody Fist is patient, he is no less bloodthirsty than the rest of his kin. He simply sates his bloodlust by bleeding his enemies dry rather than slaughtering them all at once. His rage always boils at an intense but controlled simmer, and as such, he's enjoyed many victories where a more reckless warthirster would have charged headlong into defeat.

The Bloody Fist earned his name from the war mace he wields in combat, which resembles a massive brass fist that's perpetually dripping with blood. Beyond this, The Bloody Fist wears a set of spiked brass knuckles and carries a wicked serrated whip. All of these weapons are capable of inflicting horrible wounds on their victims who quickly begin bleeding out. As befits his style of warfare, The Bloody Fist uses these weapons to wear down his foes, all while drawing vitality from the blood pouring out of their wounds. The Bloody Fist carries with him many skulls of champions who believed they could goad him into fast and reckless combat, only to find themselves slowly broken and bled dry by this cruel fiend.

### New Condition:  Wounds
While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:

 * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
 * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
 * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

##### Warthirster Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |Villages have descended into a warmongering frenzy, with riots and civil wars breaking out across the land, all heralding the arrival of a warthirster.|
|  2  |On another plane of existence, brutal gladiatorial games are held in which contestants must fend off one demonic horror after another, with the final challenge being a face-off against a warthirster.    |
|  3  |A once proud nation has been reduced to a smoldering warzone, the futureless inhabitants fighting for fighting's sake, as a warthirster rampages from one battle to the next.    |
|  4  | Barbarian tribes and roving demons, including bloodrenders and rage hounds, have begun amassing under the leadership of a warthirster, who may soon command a neigh unstoppable conquering hoard. |
|  5  |A wasteland outpost desperate for help has been cut off from supplies and reinforcements by The Bloody Fist, and its defenses are being whittled away by his forces in preparation for a final attack.|
|  6  | Two nations at war both report seeing warthirsters cutting a swath through major battles. Both nations believe this to be part of a plot by the other side.|

### Warthirster Tactics
Warthirsters excel as melee brutes and possess formidable resistance to magic thanks to their Magic Resistance and Spell Breaker traits. Their ability to fly, coupled with their aggressive nature, allows them to easily reach their desired targets. Although they can fly, warthirsters usually prefer ground combat so that they can make use of their Land Rebels trait.

#### Warthirster Weapons
Warthirsters can choose from four different weapons, each tailored to overcome specific types of opponents:

**Greataxe of Fury:** This weapon is the highest damage-dealing option for warthirsters and is particularly effective against foes with lower Strength.

**Skull Mace:** This weapon is best for dealing with spellcasters.

**Slaughter Blade:** This is the best option for dealing with enemies that tend to group up.

**War Whip:** This is a versatile weapon. It can pull in enemies who attempt to avoid melee combat, position creatures for a Slaughter Blade strike, or pull in a spellcaster for a Skull Mace attack.

\columnbreak

<Br>

#### Warthirster Reactions
Warthirsters have two available reactions:

**Vengeful Strike:** This reaction is generally the preferred choice for warthirsters as it carries less risk.

**Wrathful Counter:** Warthirsters opt for this reaction when they have received disadvantage on attack rolls, are unable to move, or have strong reason to believe an enemy spellcaster is about to cast a 6th-level or higher spell.

#### Exalted Warthirsters
The primary difference with exalted warthirsters is that they possess legendary actions, with their two primary legendary actions used as follows:

**Hellfire Breath:** The exalted warthirster uses this action whenever it can hit three or more opponents at once.

**Head Bash:** This action is used when there aren't enough targets for Hellfire Breath or when there's an opponent causing a significant amount of trouble for the warthirster. A strategic combination is for the warthirster to use Vengeful Strike to close the distance to the desired target and then utilize Head Bash on the same turn.



#### The Bloody Fist
The Bloody Fist's most unique trait is its ability to inflict bloody wounds on its targets, which is complimented by its Goreshell reaction. His main goal is to whittle down foes with wounds while sustaining itself with Goreshell. 

The following tactics can maximize The Bloody Fist's effectiveness:

**Stacking Wounds.** Stack as many wounds on a single target as possible.

**Enemy Healers.** Prioratize taking down anyone capable of casting healing spells at 5th-level or higher.

**Serrated Whip.** This can pull enemies across the blood spikes, causing a massive number of wounds on a target. The Bloody Fist should take any opportunity to use this combo, even if the pulled creature isn't his primary target.

**Switching Targets.** If the Bloody Fist's primary target becomes heavily protected by its allies, who expend significant resources to prevent further wounds, he should switch targets. The Bloody Fist will start inflicting wounds on a new foe, aiming to divert the party's attention.

**Hemorrhaging Roar.** This should be used if he can hit a group of targets who have a total of 9 wounds among them. 

<br>

> ##### Countering Spells
> Remember that a creature countering a spell must commit to doing so before knowing what spell is being cast. As a DM, this is easiest to accomplish by deciding at the start of a player's turn whether you will counter any spell that the player attempts to cast; that way, you can avoid meta-gaming with the warthirster.

### Warthirster Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didnâ€™t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you donâ€™t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Warthirster Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Warthirster Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 | Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
