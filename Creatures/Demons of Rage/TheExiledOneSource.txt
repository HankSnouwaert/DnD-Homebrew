> ***Fury Incarnate.*** On initiative count 1 (losing initiative ties), The Exiled One gains a level of fury if he has attacked a hostile creature since his last turn or taken damage since then. He can gain up to 5 levels of fury. The Exiled One gets a bonus to his AC and saving throws equal to his fury. If The Exiled One goes a minute without gaining a level of fury, he loses all of his fury.
>
> ***Rage Embodied.*** Each non-demon of rage creature that starts its turn within 300 feet of The Exiled One must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or become berserk. While berserk this way, it must use all of its movement on each of its turns to move towards The Exiled One. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns. On a successful saving throw, the creature is no longer berserk and is immune to the effect for the next hour.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The Exiled One has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Spell Breaker.*** At the start of each of The Exiled One's turns, he can end one spell of 6th level or lower of his choice affecting him or a creature within 10 feet of him that he can see. He can do this even while incapacitated.
>
> ***Standing Leap.*** The Exiled One's long jump is up to 50 feet and his high jump is up to 30 feet, with or without a running start.
>
> ***Weapons of Fury.*** Any weapon The Exiled One wields becomes magical for as long as he wields it, and The Exiled One can't be disarmed of the weapon.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The Exiled One makes a number of attacks with his Axe of Butchery equal to his Fury.
>
> ***Axe of Annihilation.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (1d12 + 9) slashing damage. This damage is increased by 6 (1d12) for each level of Fury The Exiled One has.
>
> ***Axe of Butchery.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +16 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (3d12 + 9) slashing damage.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Inescapable Wrath.*** The Exiled One moves up to his speed toward a hostile creature he can see or hear. This movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, spells, and other magical effects, and does not provoke opportunity attacks.
> 
> ### Reactions
> ***Vengeful Strike.*** When The Exiled One is hit by an attack, he can move up to half his speed towards the attacker without provoking opportunity attacks and then make a melee weapon attack against that creature if he is within reach.
>
> ***Furious Counter.*** The Exiled One attempts to interrupt a creature he can see within 300 feet casting a spell. The caster must make a DC Constitution saving throw equal to 10 + the spell's level + the amount of fury The Exiled One has. On a failed save, the caster takes 6 (1d12) fire damage per spell level, and if the save fails by 5 or more, the spell has no effect and is wasted.
> 
> ### Legendary Actions
> The Exiled One can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Exiled One regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
>
> **Axe of Annihilation.** The Exiled One makes an Axe of Annihilation attack.
>
> **Check.** The Exiled One makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> ***Inescapable Wrath.*** The Exiled One moves up to his speed toward a hostile creature he can see or hear. This movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, spells, and other magical effects, and does not provoke opportunity attacks.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If The Exiled One is suffering from an effect that allows him to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of his next turn, he may immediately make that save with advantage. He can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Bellow of Endless Fury (Costs 3 Actions).** The Exiled One lets out a roar that burns the air in a 120-foot cone in front of him, ignoring cover and magical barriers. Each creature in that area must make a DC 24 Constitution saving throw, taking 6 (1d12) fire damage plus 6 (1d12) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the save is failed by 10 or more, the creature is also stunned (NOTE: For how long?). Both the fire and thunder damage increase by 6 (1d12) for each level of Fury The Exiled One has.

#### Epic Exiled One Battle
If you wish to make The Exiled One into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 840 hit points. This increases his CR to 28.

### The Exiled One Tactics
The Exiled One uses most of the same tactics as other blood thirsters, and he never backs down from combat. The primary mechanical difference is the levels of fury he gains through a fight from his Fury Incarnate trait. Below are some tips to keep in mind.

* The Exiled One's primary objective is to engage the opponents dealing the most damage to him, as he seeks to prolong the conflict as much as possible to gain more fury.

* Use Bellow of Fury whenever it can strike three or more targets or if he is unable to reach any opponents.

 * Use his reactions the same way you would with a normal Blood Thirster

### Exiled One Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
