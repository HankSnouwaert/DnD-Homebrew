## The Exiled One

No warthirster is more feared and infamous than the berserk and unpredictable demon known as The Exiled One. This title is a mark of his great shame among his kind, for long ago, he dared strike as his master. This was a futile attack, for his master was a mighty god of rage and war, and as punishment, the demon was viciously throttled by his master before being violently hurled through the cosmos. The Exiled One fell through existence before impacting The Material Plane with the force of a meteor.

The ordeal has left The Exiled One's wings permanently mangled and broken and his face scared and disfigured. But the damage goes deeper than his immortal body. The Exiled One's mind was shattered by the intensity of his master's fury. Even compared to other warthirsters, The Exiled One is uncontrolled in his rage and bloodlust. He wanders across planes of existence from one bloody massacre to the next, always drawn to places rife with war. 

When possible, The Exiled One gathers armies of other demons of rage or demon-worshipping barbarians and leads them on bloody crusades. Though The Exiled One is seen as an outcast by most demonic forces of rage, his power cannot be denied, and many flock to him for the chance to revel in the bloody havoc he wreaks wherever he goes. Though his experiences have driven him half mad, The Exiled One still carries the wartime instincts innate to all warthirsters, and leading his forces into battle is second nature to him.

In battle, The Exiled One's rage-addled mind infects those around, causing their minds to swirl with thoughts of violence and bloodshed. As he fights, his unhinged fury grows, quickly turning him into an unstoppable engine of violence and death. Axes cleave through one foe after another as enemy and ally alike succumb to senseless rage all around him, leaving The Exiled One at the center of a swirling mealstrom of mad slaughter.

Through all this, The Exiled One hopes to someday redeem himself in the eyes of his godly master. But for all the blood he spills and all the skulls he collects, there shall be no redemption for The Exiled One, only an endless quest for one brutal battle after another.

### The Exiled One's Lair
The Exiled One is a wanderer by nature and rarely makes his lair in one location for long. These temporary abodes range from caves to rocky crags, ravaged castles, and blood-soaked battlefields. Wherever he settles, it doesn't take long for the intensity of The Exiled One's presence to twist his new surroundings. 

While in his lair, The Exiled One's challenge rating increases by 5.

#### Lair Actions

When The Exiled One rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or The Exiled One dies, the lair has an Intelligence 8 and can act of its own accord but always acts in The Exiled One's best interest. While active this way, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

**Axe of Wrath.** A brass axe slices through reality at a point within the lair and flies in a straight line in a direction the lair chooses before disappearing after it moves 100 feet or strikes a solid surface. If the axe would strike a creature, that creature must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the axe strikes the target and disappears. Anything struck by the axe takes 45 (10d8) slashing damage.

**Burning Skull Meteor.** The lair chooses a point within itself which lights up with an ominous red glow. On initiative count 20 of the next round, a 10-foot-radius burning skull falls from the sky to the chosen point. The skull passes through any Large or smaller creatures and objects, halting upon contact with a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. Any creature or object that comes into contact with the skull must make a Dexterity saving throw., taking 22 (5d8) fire damage and 22 (5d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save and half as much on a success. The area where the skull lands becomes difficult terrain until initiative count 20 of the following round. Creatures ending their turn in this area take 22 (5d8) fire damage.

**Binding Chain.** The lair manifests a chain that emerges from the ground in an unoccupied space on a solid surface of its choice within itself. The chain targets a creature selected by the lair within 100 feet of where it emerged. The targeted creature must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the creature's choice) or be pulled toward the chain and restrained by it for 1 minute. Creatures immune to the grappled condition are unaffected by this effect.

While restrained by the chain, a creature cannot move more than 10 feet away from the chain's origin point and is unable to teleport or travel between planes. The creature can use its action to attempt a DC 19 Strength check, ending the restraint on a success.

The chain has an Armor Class (AC) of 19, 30 hit points, and immunity to fire, psychic, and poison damage. If the chain is reduced to 0 hit points, it is destroyed, and the creature is no longer restrained.

> ##### Indoor Lairs
> If The Exiled One's lair is inside a structure such as a ruined keep or cave, you can change the Burning Skull Meteor lair action to be a fiery cave-in instead.

All this heralds the coming of The Exiled One, whose arrival would cause an untold escalation in bloodshed and threaten any hope of ending the war. |
|  4  | **Forsaken Redemption:** Frustrated with his inability to regain his master's favor, The Exiled One has made war on his former god and all the god's worshippers, choosing vengeance over redemption.

### The Exiled One Tactics
The Exiled One uses most of the same tactics as other blood thirsters, and he never backs down from combat. The primary mechanical difference is the levels of fury he gains through a fight from his Fury Incarnate trait. Below are some tips to keep in mind.

* The Exiled One's primary objective is to engage the opponents dealing the most damage to him, as he seeks to prolong the conflict as much as possible to gain more fury.

* Use Bellow of Fury whenever it can strike three or more targets or if he is unable to reach any opponents.

 * Use his reactions the same way you would with a normal Blood Thirster

### Exiled One Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
