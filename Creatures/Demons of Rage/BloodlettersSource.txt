#### Alternate Locus Abilities
You can replace the Locus of Wrath trait of Blood Reapers or Heralds of Rage with one of the following alternative abilities to customize your bloodletter and the demonic force it's leading:

***Locus of Warding.*** The bloodletter and each demon of rage within 30 feet of it has resistance to damage from spells.
 
 ***Locus of Fury.*** All demons of rage within 30 feet of the bloodletter count as being within 10 feet of each other for the purposes of the Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide abilities.

> ##### Rage Riders
> If you wish to have any bloodletter you're using ride a controlled mount, you can give it the following trait:<br> ***Rage Rider.*** If the bloodletter has a controlled mount that is also a demon of rage, the mount can take the Attack action once on each of the bloodletter's turns and use its bonus action on its turn. If it takes this action, the mount cannot take Dash, Disengage, and Dodge on that turn.

### Bloodletter Tactics
Bloodletters are nimble melee shock troops. Below are some tips for using them most effectively:
* Keep them in groups to maximize the effectiveness of their Murderous Tide ability. 
* They are fragile, so strike hard and fast. 
* They have high attack bonuses, so you can use them to bring down tanky targets with high AC.

#### Exalted and Hellforged Bloodletters
* Try to trigger Hungering Blade by attacking whoever is the closest to 0 hit points.
* Have the bloodthirsters work together to trigger Hungering Blade with their Merciless Tide ability.

#### Blood Reapers & Heralds of Rage
These bloodletters serve as commanders and should take up central positions among other demons of rage to make the most use of Merciless Tide. They have two new abilities to consider:

**Bloodmark:** This ability should be activated when two or more demons have engaged in melee combat with an opponent. Don't use it early; otherwise, the marked enemy will have the chance to retreat.

**Revel In Slaughter:** Use this ability early in the fight once most of the bloodletter's allies are within attack range. Don't save this for everyone to get hit by debilitating effects, as that is too hard to predict. 

##### Locus of Rage Abilities
&emsp;**Locus of Fury.** This ability allows the bloodletters to spread out while still reaping the benefits of Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide. It is useful when the enemy attempts to slow down or separate the bloodletters or when a bloodletter needs to engage a spellcaster or ranged attacker.

**Locus of Warding.** This ability is designed to protect the bloodletters from area-of-effect damaging spells. It greatly benefits the bloodletters since they need to be close to each other to make the most of their Murderous Tide ability.

**Locus of Wrath.** With this ability, the bloodletter's minions can adopt an even more reckless attack strategy. However, if the leader is destroyed early, the minions will never reap the benefits of this ability.

#### Rage Riders
Bloodletters typically ride juggernauts, which can knock their prey prone. As such, the juggernaut should attack first so the bloodletter can gain advantage against the prone target. Additionally, remember that the juggernaut is a demon of rage, allowing it to contribute to the Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide abilities.

### Bloodletter Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Bloodletter Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
