## Skull Cannons
Forged in the infernal forges that burn eternally in the heart of the netherworld, these wheeled engines of destruction are the product of demonic smiths who imbue their creations with a blend of dark magic and twisted metal. Armed with cannons that belch forth flaming skulls, these engines of war are designed for both terror and obliteration. Ridden into battle by demons who revel in carnage, skull cannons are as much a symbol of demonic might as they are instruments of war, their approach heralding a storm of fire and death.

The construction of a skull cannon is a vile alchemy of flesh and metal, with its structure housing a gaping maw capable of devouring those unfortunate enough to be caught in its path. This horrific feature serves a purpose beyond mere intimidation; the souls and bones of the devoured are transmuted within the bowels of the cannon, their essence fueling the dark sorceries that allow the cannon to unleash its deadly projectiles. Each skull fired from its depths carries with it the anguish and fury of the damned, seeking out the enemies of its masters with a malevolent intent, exploding in hellfire upon impact.

The use of skull cannons in the vanguard of demonic armies serves a dual purpose. Not only do they soften enemy lines with their relentless barrage, but the very act of their feeding and firing sows terror among those who witness it. The skulls of the devoured victims, now ammunition for the cannon, are a grim reminder of the fate that awaits those who fall before these demonic engines

***Blood Shrines.*** Blood shrines serve as alternative demonic engines to skull cannons, distinguished by their lack of artillery and the presence of demonic altars from which blood ceaselessly flows. These altars are capable of instilling a surge of bloodlust in allies, empowering them with a relentless desire for battle. Unlike their skull cannon counterparts, blood shrines utilize the devoured victims not as ammunition, but as a source of unholy power, fueling the shrine's ability to enhance the ferocity of its demonic adherents. This gruesome synergy between sacrifice and empowerment makes the blood shrine a terrifying presence on any battlefield, bolstering the forces of rage with supernatural vigor.

##### Skull Cannon Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Siege of Skulls:** A city is under siege by a cult that has constructed a skull cannon outside its walls. The adventurers must sneak out of the city, navigate through enemy lines, and find a way to destroy or sabotage the skull cannon before it breaches the city's defenses and unleashes chaos within its walls.|
|  2  |**The Forbidden Forge:** Rumors have surfaced of a hidden forge where skull cannons are being constructed. The adventurers are tasked with locating this forge, which is said to be guarded by a cabal of dark sorcerers and their demonic minions. Infiltrating the forge presents an opportunity not only to halt the production of these terrifying engines but also to uncover ancient secrets of demonic engineering. |
|  3  | **The Skull Harvest:** A village is plagued by raids from a cult seeking skulls to fuel their skull cannon. The adventurers are hired to protect the village and put an end to these raids. However, they soon discover that the cult's true target is an ancient burial ground said to contain the skulls of legendary warriors. Preventing the desecration of this sacred site and stopping the cult requires cunning, bravery, and perhaps the aid of the spirits resting there.|
|  4  | **The Blood March:** A warlord has harnessed the power of a blood shrine to imbue his army with unnatural strength and ferocity, threatening to overrun neighboring territories. The adventurers must find a way to infiltrate his heavily guarded encampment, destroy the shrine, and break the spell over his soldiers before his campaign of terror can go any further. |

> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The skull cannon can use its Burning Skull, then makes an attack.
>
> ***Burning Skull (2/day).*** The skull cannon targets a point 30 to 300 feet away from it that it or a creature mounted on it can see, and fires a burning skull. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) fire damage plus 10 (3d6) piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success.
>
> If the Skull Cannon uses this action, creatures outside the Skull Cannon can use their reaction to make opportunity attacks against it as though it moved out of their reach.
>
> ***Ram.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the skull cannon moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, it can make a Bite attack against the same target as a bonus action, whether it hit or missed.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage plus 7 (2d6) fire damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be swallowed by the skull cannon. A swallowed creature is Blinded and Restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the skull cannon, and takes 7 (2d6) fire damage plus 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage at the start of each of the skull cannon's turns. The skull cannon regains hit points equal to the damage dealt to creatures inside it this way. If the creature is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and is turned to ash, and the skull cannon regains a use of its Burning Skull ability if the creature was Small or larger and had a skull.
>
> The skull cannon can have up to three targets swallowed at a time. A creature trapped inside the skull cannon can make a DC 17 Strength check as an action. On a success, one swallowed creature of their choice is freed, which falls prone in a space within 5 feet of the skull cannon. If the skull cannon dies, a swallowed creature is no longer Restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

### Blood Shrine Variant
You can use an alternate version of this monster known as a blood shrine. To do so, make the following changes to the skull cannon's stat block.
* Replace the Burning Skull feature with Surge of Bloodletting, described below: <br>
***Surge of Bloodletting (2/Day).*** The blood shrine targets up to three other allied demons of rage it can see within 60 feet of it. Each of those targets that can see the blood shrine can use its reaction to move up to half its speed and make one melee attack with advantage.
* Replace the skull catapult's Multiattack action with the following:<br>
***Multiattack.*** The blood shrine makes an attack or uses Reckless Drift, then may use Surge of Bloodletting.

* Change the skull Cannon's Bite attack so that creatures that die while swallowed by it recharge a use of its Surge of Bloodletting rather than Burning Skull. 


### Skull Cannon Tactics
Below are the general attack sequences the skull cannon will follow. It is extremely unintelligent and will not deviate from this attack pattern much unless guided by other creatures. Additionally, without the guidance of other creatures, it may not be able to identify ideal targets for some of its attacks as specified in the strategies below.

**While the skull cannon has Burning Skull available:**
1. Fire Burning Skull at the largest group of opponents; if there are no opponents grouped together, fire at the opponent that appears the least dexterous.
2. Charge at a nearby enemy that appears to have low Strength and Dexterity and attempt to swallow it.
3. Repeat the above steps until Burning Skull is no longer available, at which point repeat step 2.

#### Creatures Mounted on the Skull Cannon
Most skull cannons are guided by two or more bloodrenders, which do not use it as a controlled mount but rather ready their attacks for when it charges into a target. At that point, they can make an attack against it before it is swallowed. 


### Blood Shrine Tactics

Unlike the skull cannon, blood shrines rush straight at enemies alongside other demons of rage. Have it charge groups of enemies before using Surge of Bloodletting to help other demons reach their foes. Like the skull cannon, the blood shrine should try to swallow enemies that have low Strength and Dexterity.

### Skull Cannon & Blood Shrine Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didnâ€™t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you donâ€™t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skull Cannon & Blood Shrine Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
