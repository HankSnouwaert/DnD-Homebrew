## Flesh Hounds

These fiends are literal dogs of war. They <br> have the appearance of blood-red canines with <br> demonic features whose fanged maws glow with <br> infernal heat.  They charge across the field of battle in bloodthirsty hunting packs, constantly searching for their next victims.  The demonic howl of a flesh hound boils the air, cooking entire regiments of foes in an instant.  Wounded survivors are then set upon with claws and teeth capable of crushing through armor, and any who attempt to flee are quickly hunted down and ripped to bloody shreds.

Flesh hounds are often used as beasts of war and hunting dogs by demonic masters.  Unfortunate souls who have earned the ire of such a demon may find themselves pursued by these tireless hunters.  For once a flesh hound gets the scent of its prey, it does not rest until its quarry's mangled body is delivered to its master.

To ensure no magic interferes with the flesh hound's hunt, each fiend is fitted with a runic collar that wards off spellcraft.  Flesh hounds have a special hatred for magic users and are trained to prioritize the slaughter of such individuals.  In battle, demonic commanders often use flesh hounds as anti-magic minions, utilizing their mobility and magic resistance to quickly run down and shred enemy mages before they can interfere with combat.

### Flesh Hounds of the Blood Hunt

These fiends are the reincarnated souls of history's most ruthless hunters, whose insatiable bloodlust and savagery in life cursed them to live their demonic afterlives as murder-crazed canines. These creatures stand apart from their kin as more recklessly brutal and bloodthirsty with an even more powerful runic collar, which makes it all but impossible for spellcasters to impede their advance. 
These hounds are unleashed for the most formidable of pursuits, their presence signifying a relentless and deadly hunt that spares no one. Legends of their exploits recount the destruction of mighty forces, the demise of powerful wielders of magic, and the downfall of creatures thought invincible. Their prowess is unmatched, especially against those who harness magic, making them a deadly force against all who stand in their way.

The tale of these flesh hounds serves as a dire warning about the price of indulging in the primal thrill of the hunt. They are the embodiment of the predator's spirit, both revered and feared for their unmatched ferocity. 
To be targeted by the Blood Hunt is to confront an inescapable truth: their hunt knows no bounds, no mercy, and no end.

##### Flesh Hound Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |One or more party members have earned the ire of a demonic hunt master who has unleashed a pack of flesh hounds to pursue the party.|
|  2  |A half-mad wizard begs the party for safety from a pack of unrelenting flesh hounds.  |
|  3  |A demon-worshipping noble keeps a pack of flesh hounds to guard his manor grounds.    |
|  4  |A wizard crime lord has lost control of the flesh hounds he summoned to dispatch a spell-casting rival. |
|  5  | A demonic researcher wants the party to capture a flesh hound to study its anti-magic properties.|
|  6  | A cruel warlord releases prisoners of war only to have them hunted down by bloodthirsty flesh hounds of the blood hunt.|

### Flesh Hound Tactics
Flesh hounds are specifically designed to target backline spellcasters. Below are some tips for using them most effectively:
* Have them make a beeline for any spellcaster they see; their spell resistance and Sorcerer Stalker traits will keep magic from slowing them down.
* If they can't reach a target concentrating on a spell, try to hit the said target with Burning Howl.
* Try to surround spellcasters with multiple flesh hounds to prevent escape.

#### Hounds of the Blood Hunt
* Their Collar of Nullification means they are even better at preventing themselves from being impeded by spells than normal flesh hounds.
* Spell casters that deal high damage are still a major threat and should be the highest priority targets.
* Remember that Gore Feast can be triggered twice per round, once on the flesh hound's turn and again when it makes an attack of opportunity or uses its Mage Slayer reaction.
* The extra damage potential from Gore Feast and Mage Slayer means these flesh hounds will risk taking significant damage to reach enemy spell casters.

###  Flesh Hound Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.


Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
 
####  Flesh Hound Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
