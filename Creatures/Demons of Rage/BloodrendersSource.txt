## Bloodrenders

These demonic warriors sport massive horns, blood-red hides, and a skull-like visage whose eyes burn with endless rage. Bloodrenders wield mighty hellblades with brutal skill and often serve as demonic footsoldiers. They attack with unrestrained brutality, feeding off the aggression and violence of combat. Bloodrenders fighting together will drive each other to greater heights of hatred, cutting through enemies in a maddened frenzy.

Bloodrenders often make up the bulk of demonic armies in service to demon lords of war and hatred. In some worlds, they slaughter in the name of a specific master, while in others, they serve as demonic footsoldiers utilized by multiple demon lords.  

Bloodrenders are often encountered in small roving warbands but can sometimes form the backbone of world-ending demonic armies.   While they are deadly and unrelenting warriors, their single-minded need for slaughter usually prohibits them from performing complex long-term strategies. For bloodrenders, combat is an end unto itself.

If it takes this action, the mount cannot take Dash, Disengage, and Dodge on that turn.

These demons may <br> have been particularly formidable and <br> brutal mortal warriors whose souls were <br> forged into especially powerful demonic <br> forms upon death, or they may have been <br> "ordinary" blood renders whose bloody deeds <br> earned them  their master's blessing, allowing them <br> to ascend in rank. These "exalted" bloodrenders are fueled  by a hatred that makes them harder to kill and drives them into a berserk frenzy whenever they spill the blood of their foes.

***The Hellforged.*** Some bloodrenders carry such levels of hate that it threatens to tear their bodies apart from within. The most strongwilled of these bloodrenders refuse to die such an ignominious death, and some have held themselves together by having bands of demonic iron welded across their body by fiendish smiths. These searing metal scraps are bolted onto the demon's flesh through a torturous process that ensures its form will continue to house the burning rancor within.

Known as the Hellforged, these bloodrenders keep themselves held together only so they may continue to spite the world. With their every action, they seek to inflict as much damage as possible, their attacks striking at their foes' vulnerabilities with frightening ease. The Hellforged constantly move from one battle to the next, pausing only to weld their forms back together so they may continue to punish the world for the excruciating malice they must bear.

***Bloodrender Commanders.*** The most powerful among the bloodrenders become warlords commanding entire armies of bloodthirsty demons. Their superior martial skills are matched only by their rage, which drives them into an insane fury on the battlefield, and they serve as burning beacons to other demonic followers of rage who eagerly follow them into battle. The bloodreavers are the lesser commanders who lead small roving warbands, while the heralds of rage are mighty warlords who can command entire legions of demonic warriors.

These commanders draw power from violence and so inspire their followers to ever greater acts of carnage and mayhem. For many, even violence inflicted against them and their followers only serves to bolster their fury, thus perpetuating their cycle of violence. These fiends even possess the ability to curse foes with their hatred, causing every blow dealt to the marked victim to spill gratuitous amounts of blood, ensuring even the mightiest warriors will eventually succumb to the endless rage.

#### Alternate Locus Abilities
You can replace the Locus of Wrath trait of Bloodreavers or Heralds of Rage with one of the following alternative abilities to customize your bloodrender and the demonic force it's leading:

***Locus of Warding.*** The bloodrender and each demon of rage within 30 feet of it has resistance to damage from spells.
 
 ***Locus of Fury.*** All demons of rage within 30 feet of the bloodrender count as being within 10 feet of each other for the purposes of the Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide abilities.

### Bloodrender Tactics
Bloodrenders are nimble melee shock troops. Below are some tips for using them most effectively:
* Keep them in groups to maximize the effectiveness of their Murderous Tide ability. 
* They are fragile, so strike hard and fast. 
* They have high attack bonuses, so you can use them to bring down tanky targets with high AC.

#### Exalted and Hellforged Bloodrenders
* Try to trigger Hungering Blade by attacking whoever is the closest to 0 hit points.
* Have the bloodthirsters work together to trigger Hungering Blade with their Merciless Tide ability.

#### Bloodreavers & Heralds of Rage
These bloodrenders serve as commanders and should take up central positions among other demons of rage to make the most use of Merciless Tide. They have two new abilities to consider:

**Bloodmark:** This ability should be activated when two or more demons have engaged in melee combat with an opponent. Don't use it early; otherwise, the marked enemy will have the chance to retreat.

**Revel In Slaughter:** Use this ability early in the fight once most of the bloodrender's allies are within attack range. Don't save this for everyone to get hit by debilitating effects, as that is too hard to predict. 

##### Locus of Rage Abilities
&emsp;**Locus of Fury.** This ability allows the bloodrenders to spread out while still reaping the benefits of Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide. It is useful when the enemy attempts to slow down or separate the bloodrenders or when a bloodrender needs to engage a spellcaster or ranged attacker.

**Locus of Warding.** This ability is designed to protect the bloodrenders from area-of-effect damaging spells. It greatly benefits the bloodrenders since they need to be close to each other to make the most of their Murderous Tide ability.

**Locus of Wrath.** With this ability, the bloodrender's minions can adopt an even more reckless attack strategy. However, if the leader is destroyed early, the minions will never reap the benefits of this ability.

#### Rage Riders
Bloodrenders typically ride juggernauts, which can knock their prey prone. As such, the juggernaut should attack first so the bloodrender can gain advantage against the prone target. Additionally, remember that the juggernaut is a demon of rage, allowing it to contribute to the Murderous Tide and Merciless Tide abilities.

### Bloodrender Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Bloodrender Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
