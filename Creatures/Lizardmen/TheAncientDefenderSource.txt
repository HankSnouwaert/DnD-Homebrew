## The Last Defender

In the annals of lizardmen history, few heroes are revered as fervently as The Last Defender and his ferocious carnosaur steed, Grimlokk. The two are forever linked by their valor, their triumphs, and their unwavering commitment to their people.

The title of "The Last Defender" is not simply a moniker but a testament to this saurus general's valor and determination. As waves of ravenous demons beset a key lizardmen city, it was The Last Defender who rallied the last battalion of saurus warriors. Against overwhelming odds, they held their ground, ensuring the city's crucial artifacts were safeguarded and its legacy preserved.

Physically, The Last Defender is an imposing figure. Towering over other saurus, his scales bear the hues of deep azure mixed with streaks of golden yellow, symbolizing his celestial blessings. His age is marked by countless scars, each narrating tales of brutal confrontations, and his eyes shimmer with a wisdom and determination few can match.

A master tactician, The Last Defender is renowned for his skill in jungle warfare. He employs the dense foliage and treacherous terrain to stage deadly ambushes, leveraging the element of surprise to decimate his enemies. An aura of mystical defense surrounds him, granting divine protection to him and those nearby. In his hand, he wields a revered magical spear, said to be a gift from the gods.

 Those unfortunate enough to be struck by it are tormented by nightmarish visions that fracture their very psyche. Complementing this is a gauntlet, worn on his left arm, capable of harnessing the sun's fury and releasing it in searing blasts upon his foes.

Grimlokk, The Last Defender’s loyal carnosaur, is a beast of nightmares. Larger and more ferocious than his kin, his dark scales are perfect for moving unseen through the dense jungles. While he possesses the raw power to tear enemies apart, he shows remarkable finesse in stalking and ambushing his prey, particularly targeting those already wounded to ensure their swift demise.

The bond between The Last Defender and Grimlokk transcends that of warrior and mount. Grimlokk obeys every command, every nuance, making their combat dance a seamless blend of precision and brutality. They function as extensions of one another, coordinating their attacks to maximize their impact on the battlefield.

Together, The Last Defender and Grimlokk symbolize the undying spirit of the lizardmen civilization. Their tales, spoken in hushed reverence by the skinks, serve as reminders of the sacrifices made and the relentless fight to ensure their race's survival in a world rife with threats. Their legacy is not just of victory, but of duty, resilience, and undying determination.

### Epic Encounter: <Br> The Defender  & The Beast
If you wish to combine The Last Defender and Grimlokk in one encounter, you can grant them the following shared abilities. When using these abilities, you can treat them as a single CR 25 creature for the purposes of determining XP and encounter difficulty for players.

***Attuned to the Beast:*** When Grimlokk serves as The Last Defender's mount, The Last Defender can direct Grimlokk to take the Attack action once during each of The Last Defender's turns. If either Grimlokk or The Last Defender is reduced to 0 hit points, the other enters a Rampage state that lasts for one minute. While in this Rampage, they have advantage on attack rolls and deal an additional 11 (2d10) damage on successful hits.


#### Shared Legendary Actions
Grimlokk and The Last Defender possess a joint pool of 3 legendary actions when they are engaged in combat together, choosing from the options detailed below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time between both of them and only at the end of another creature's turn. They regain their expended legendary actions at the start of The Last Defender's turn. Should one of them fall, the other retains the ability to use these actions for the subsequent hour.

**Check.** Either Grimlokk or The Last Defender can perform a skill check that would ordinarily require an action.

**Movement.** Grimlokk or The Last Defender can move up to 30 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity. Should Grimlokk or The Last Defender come within 5 feet of each other during this movement, The Last Defender can instantly mount Grimlokk, provided he has a movement speed of 5ft or more. Additionally, he can opt to dismount Grimlokk at any time during this movement.

**Claw.** Grimlokk makes a claw attack.

**Spear.** The Last Defender makes an attack with the Spear of Dread Visions. If the attack hits a creature, that creature is afflicted with a vision (described in the attack description).

**Tenacious Will.** If either Grimlokk or The Last Defender is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. This legendary action can be used while incapacitated.

**Deadly Onslaught. (Costs 2 Actions)** Both Grimlokk and The Last Defender launch a wild barrage of attacks. Every creature within 5 feet of either of them must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 13 (3d8) slashing damage and is inflicted with a carnosaur wound (as described in Grimlokk's Bite attack). However, if a creature that fails the save is within 5 feet of both The Last Defender and Grimlokk, it sustains two wounds.

**Roar of Reckoning. (Costs 2 Actions)** Grimlokk and The Last Defender simultaneously emit powerful, divine roars in twin 120-foot cones. Any creature other than Grimlokk and The Last Defender in the area of either cone must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it loses concentration, is knocked prone, and is inflicted with a vision (as described in The Last Defender's Spear of Dread Visions attack). If a creature is in the area of both cones, it receives two visions on a failed save.

### New Magic Items
The following are new lizardmen-themed magic items you can add to your adventures. They are both used by The Last Defender and if players defeat him, you could give them the opportunity to loot these items for themselves.


#### Spear of Dread Visions
*Weapon (spear), rare (requires attunement), 4,000gp*

This spear was said to have been wielded by the Old Ones themselves. Those struck by it are inflicted with visions of doom that sap them of their will to carry on. The spear grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

**Returning Throw:** If the spear is thrown, it immediately flies back to your hand after the attack.

**Visionary Assault:** Once during your turn, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can inflict upon it a mystical vision. At the end of each of the affected creature's turns, it takes 2 (1d4) psychic damage for each vision it has been inflicted with.

A creature can have multiple visions simultaneously, and if it is suffering from three or more visions, it is blinded and has disadvantage on Intelligence, Charisma, and Wisdom saving throws and checks until the visions are removed.


Visions can be removed by the *remove curse* spell or any effect that can remove the blinded condition. A creature with visions or another creature within 5 feet can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Insight) check as an action, ending all visions on a success (NOTE: What does this check represent?).

A creature with Truesight cannot gain these <Br> visions, and all visions are removed if a creature <Br> gains Truesight. 

\columnbreak

#### Hand of Gods
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement), 5000gp*

This divine relic appears to be a golden gauntlet with an extended arm piece. While wearing it, its user can create blazing balls of sunlight in the gauntlet's palm, which can then be blasted at enemies.

To attune to this item, you must affix it to your arm, either at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder. Upon doing so, the prosthetic magically transforms, replicating the appearance and function of the limb it's replacing. Once attached, it becomes an integral part of your body.

**Radiant Assault:** Once per turn, when you would normally make an unarmed strike, you can instead opt to make a ranged spell attack with a range of 100ft. using this item. For this attack, add your Wisdom modifier and proficiency bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the target suffers 4d10 radiant damage.

### Grimlokk & <br>The Last Defender Loot
Valuable items looted from Grimlokk will generally come from whatever can be harvested from it. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a carnosaur. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Because saurus are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Last Defender are the remains of the equipment he was using or valuables he was carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. 

If you are combining Grimlokk and The Last Defender for a single epic boss battle, you can have them drop some truly valuable artifacts. These artifacts can be harvested or found the same way you find loot from The Last Defender. Though, you may change the checks to Intelligence (Religion) or Intelligence (Arcana) depending on the nature of the artifacts.

As an alternative to making any checks, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Grimlokk & <br>The Last Defender Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Last Defender <br> & Grimlokk Tactics

The Last Defender is a masterful warrior known for his strategic prowess. He often waits for the opportune moment to ambush foes and unleash his unique abilities. His loyal companion Grimlokk, follows his every command, creating potent synergy between their capabilities. 

**Wounds and Visions:** Both The Last Defender and Grimlokk have abilities that can stack damaging effects on enemies. These effects become highly debilitating at three stacks. In combat, prioritize stacking these effects.

**Sacred Wrath:** The Last Defender's Sacred Wrath reaction is reserved for adversaries with low Charisma, who will likely fail the saving throw.

**Blood Tracking:** This aids The Last Defender and Grimlokk in relentlessly pursuing wounded enemies. 

**Starting Turn:** Begin by stealthily approaching targets with The Last Defender mounted on Grimlokk. Once in position, Grimlokk should use its Frightful Presence and the defender should use his Sacred Aura. Focus the initial attacks on the most vulnerable enemy. If needed, leverage Grimlokk's ability to move with legendary actions to close distance. <Br><br>

**The Last Defender's Multiattack Sequence:**
* Initiate with a Tail Trip attack, followed by a Bite attack on the same target.
* Make the spear attack against the enemy with the most visions, even if the target is at a distance.
* For foes beyond Grimlokk's reach, such as flying enemies, use the Hand of Gods attack.



**Grimlokk's Multiattack Sequence:**
* Begin with a bite attack to grapple and restrain a target.
* Take advantage of the grappled foe by using a claw attack against it.
* After a bite and claw, it may make sense to carry a grappled target away from allies who could help it. Either way, Grimlokk should make a tail attack against another target if able.



**The Last Defender & Grimlokk's Legendary Actions:**
* **Movement:** The Last Defender can mount/dismount Grimlokk. Beyond closing this to close in on foes, they can also coordinate their movement to strategically split opponents. For example, Grimlokk could grapple a paladin with a protective aura and carry him away from the party, leaving them with The Last Defender.
* **Claw or Spear:** Choose which of these attacks to use based on which debuff stack (wounds or visions) is closer to 3 on the target.
* **Roar of Recking & Deadly Onslaught:** Use either of these abilities if you can affect four or more targets. These abilities are important ways to quickly stack wounds and visions on targets.
