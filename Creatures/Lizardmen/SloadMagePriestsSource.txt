## Sload Mage-Priests
*Ancient Arcane Masters & Stewards of The Great Plan*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual <br>
Deep within the primeval jungles lie hidden temples from a bygone age, their enigmatic structures standing as relics of a lost era. At the heart of these strange edifices are vast chambers, where the air is thick with humidity and hums with sorcerous power. In the center of each chamber floats a massive, bloated creature of immense mystic might—surpassed only by the gods themselves. These spellcasters are the sload mage-priests: ancient, amphibian beings who manipulate magic as effortlessly as mortals breathe.

Seated upon golden palanquins that hover gently above the ground, sustained solely by their esoteric thoughts, these beings wield unparalleled arcane power. Their bulbous eyes perceive the strands of magic weaving through the world, and with elegant gestures of their multi-jointed fingers, they draw arcane energy to themselves like rivers rushing to the sea. With such vast magical reserves, a sload mage-priest can unleash spells of devastating magnitude—storms of fire that consume cities, entire armies turned to stone in a flash of light, or thoughts amplified into overwhelming cacophonies that shatter the minds of even the most astute wizards.

The powers of the sload mage-priests vary among their kind. Some wield terrifying defenses, ignoring blades and arrows as if they were illusions, while others are nearly unkillable, regenerating severed limbs and knitting gaping wounds within seconds. Certain mage-priests can silence enemy spellcasters with a mere gesture, unraveling incantations and rendering their magic impotent.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

The sload are said to have been created by a race of godlike beings who sought to reshape the world according to their grand design. The sload were crafted to aid in this monumental undertaking. Guided by their divine makers, they shifted continents, altered planetary orbits, and nurtured species deemed worthy while purging those found unfit. But this great plan was never completed. A cataclysm—unwittingly triggered by the very designs of their creators—plunged the world into chaos. When the dust settled, the gods were gone, and the mightiest sload mage-priests—those with the deepest knowledge of the plan—had perished.

Those who remain are the last of their kind. Most dwell in their humid chambers in deep meditation, so profound that they might be mistaken for dead. In truth, their minds are anything but idle—they traverse time and space, contemplating the fragmented instructions left by their vanished masters. These trances can last lifetimes without interruption. When a sload mage-priest finally stirs, it is often because they believe they have uncovered a fragment of the great plan and now intend to act upon it.

Guarded by vast cohorts of lizardmen who revere them as living saints of the Old Gods, mage-priests command unwavering loyalty. When they proclaim what must be done to fulfill the divine vision, their cold-blooded followers act without hesitation. Whether these actions stem from true divine insight or a desperate search for purpose is irrelevant—when a sload mage-priest acts with conviction, few forces in the world can stand in their way.

### Disciplines of The Old Ones
A sload mage-priest can be granted any of the following traits to reflect its age and power. Younger mage-priests typically have one trait, while the eldest mage-priests may have as many as four. Each trait granted increases its CR by 2. 

#### Becalming Cogitation
The mage-priest can cast *Dampen Magic* at will.

#### Harrowing Scrutiny
At the start of the mage-priest’s turn, it unleashes an aura of otherworldly authority. Each hostile creature within 120 feet of it must succeed on a *DC 20 Wisdom Saving Throw.* <br>
*Failure.* The creature is Frightened until the start of the mage-priest’s next turn. While Frightened this way, the creature can cast only cantrips. <br>
*Failure by 10 or More.* The creature is Paralyzed while Frightened. <br>
*Success.* The creature becomes immune to Harrowing Scrutiny for 24 hours.

#### Harmonic Convergence
At the end of its turn, the mage-priest may begin a ritual drawing on the winds of magic. While the ritual is active, it has advantage on spell attack rolls, and creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against its spells. A creature within 15 feet can use an action or bonus action to make a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check to disrupt the ritual.

*Failure.* The creature takes 22 (4d10) Force damage. <br>
*Failure by 5 or More.* The creature takes 33 (6d10) Force damage. <br>
*Success.* The ritual ends. <br>
*Success by 5 or More.* The ritual ends, and the creature channels some of the energy. The next spell of 1st level or higher it casts before the end of its next turn is cast as if using a slot 1 level higher.

#### Higher State of Consciousness
The mage-priest can move through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) Force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It has resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage. If the mage-priest takes 30 or more damage from spells on a turn, it loses this trait until the start of its next turn.

#### Focus on Mystery
On initiative count 30 of the first round of combat (losing initiative ties), the mage-priest casts *storm of magic*. This casting doesn’t require concentration and ends only if the mage-priest chooses to end it or dies.


#### Soul of Stone
The mage-priest’s concentration on spells can’t be broken as a result of taking damage.


\columnbreak

#### Transcendent Healing
Choose one damage type other than Force. The mage-priest regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn. If the mage-priest takes 20 or more damage of the chosen damage type before its next turn, this regeneration doesn’t function on its next turn. The mage-priest only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.

#### Unfathomable Presence
The mage-priest has resistance to damage from spells. If it takes 30 or more Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage on a turn, it loses this trait until the start of its next turn.

### Sload Mage-Priest Tactics
Sload mage-priests are powerful spellcasters who excel when supported by minions, allowing them to maintain distance while unleashing devastating spells or providing support to their allies.

If their enemies remain undefeated—or are not close to defeat—after expending these spells, mage-priests should retreat.

### Sload Mage-Priest Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from sload mage-priests are the ancient relics they carry with them. However, some more macabre looters may harvest their remains for materials that hold some lingering power. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** checks. At the DM's discretion, harvesting their bodies can be done using an **Intelligence (Medicine)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 Radiant damage and become Blinded until the end of your next turn. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t Blinded.
 
***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.

#### Divine Judgment
*9th-level Divination (Cleric)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous

You call down divine judgment upon those around you. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. You gain insight into each creature's thoughts (if it has any), emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind—such as a fear, love, or hatred. You then choose for each creature to be subjected to one of the following effects:

**Guilty.**  The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 Radiant damage, falls Prone, and is Stunned until the start of your next turn. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing or carrying, except magic items, is reduced to a pile of fine salt.

If the creature is a celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend, it is instead banished to its plane of origin (if it is not already there) and cannot return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *Wish* spell.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

**Innocent.** The creature regains 8d6 hit points. In addition, it is cured of all diseases and any conditions causing it to be Blinded, Deafened, or Poisoned.

#### Final Transmutation
*9th-level Transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bar of lead)
- **Duration:**  1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You speak a word of power that transforms a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails. On a failed save, it is Petrified, turning to gold until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature is Restrained until the end of your next turn.

**Ending The Effect.** A Petrified target can make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of your turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell, it remains Petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Obsessed* with the Petrified creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

**Damaging A Petrified Creature.** If a Petrified creature is physically damaged or broken during this state, it will manifest the same damage upon being reverted to its original form.

**New condition described at end of document*

#### Plague of Rust
*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of gold thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small magnet)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You conjure three spinning blades of returning and launch them outwards. Each blade appears in an unoccupied 5-foot cube adjacent to you and immediately flies up to 100 feet in a straight line in a direction of your choice. The blades hover at their destinations until the start of your next turn, at which point they move back toward you in straight lines. A blade disappears when it reaches you or after it has traveled a total of 100 feet.

The first time a blade enters a creature’s space (other than yours) during its initial flight or return, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d10 Slashing damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 2d10 for every slot level above 8.

___

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure an animated weapon infused with magical power. Choose Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage when you cast the spell. The weapon appears in an unoccupied space within range and lasts for the duration.

When the weapon appears, you may immediately make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 damage of the chosen type and suffers an additional effect based on the type selected:

* **Bludgeoning:** You can move the target up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space.

* **Piercing:** Treat any 1 or 2 rolled on the damage dice as a 3.

* **Slashing:** The target’s speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the weapon up to 20 feet to a space you can see and repeat the attack against the same or a different target within 5 feet.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 1d10 for every slot level above 7.

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil. On a failed save, for the duration of the spell, the target has disadvantage on all checks and saving throws not triggered by this spell, and attack rolls against it have advantage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet

You summon swirling shadows to whisk away up to six willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range. Each creature is teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you, and must appear within 15 feet of at least one other teleported creature.

Upon arriving, each creature becomes Invisible until the end of your next turn and may immediately take the Hide action (no action required).

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

*9th-level Illusion (Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___

You summon a sphere of pure nightmares that warps the minds of those caught within. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it.

A 20-foot-radius sphere of nightmares appears, centered on a point of your choice within range. When a creature enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. 

On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes Frightened of the sphere for the duration. While Frightened in this way, it can’t take reactions and must use the Dash action to move away from the sphere by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. At the end of each of its turns, the Frightened creature takes 5d10 Psychic damage and can then repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature that succeeds on its initial saving throw is immune to this spell for the rest of its duration.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet to a point you can see.

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.


\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Obsessed 
> The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.
