## The Wanderer

In the expansive lore of the lizardmen, a figure of myth and legend emerges from the mists of time, known only as "The Wanderer." This ancient crox is a living testament to battles past and a beacon of hope for the lizardmen in their darkest hours. He roams the lands, appearing where he is needed most and leaving countless legends in his wake.

Among the Crox, The Wanderer stands unparalleled â€” taller, broader, and evidently older than any of his kin. His body is a canvas of ancient scars, each narrating a saga of valor and struggle. Rather than typical armors, he's adorned with ceremonial artifacts, tokens from grateful tribes and tributes to the gods. Some of these tokens are so deeply embedded that they seem hammered into his very scales, becoming a part of him.

In battle, The Wanderer is a force of nature. He wields a massive maul, its weight and power enough to cleave through multiple adversaries in a single swing. His primal roar, a testament to his age and vigor, has the power to send enemies scrambling in fear and uplift the spirits of allies. But it's not just his weapon that foes should fear; with jaws capable of crushing bone, claws sharp enough to rend armor, and a tail adept at tripping those who venture too close, he's the embodiment of natural ferocity.

With every victory, The Wanderer doesn't just triumph over his adversaries, but he also wins the favor of the lizardmen deities. Each god values different facets of combat and nature, and through his myriad victories, The Wanderer touches upon each of their domains. Be it a fierce battle that pleases the god of storms, the hunt of a mighty monster that wins the respect of the god of beasts, or a saved lizardmen city that earns the smile of the goddess of protection, his actions resonate in the divine realms, cementing his status as their chosen champion.

Mysterious in his ways, The Wanderer has a knack for appearing when the lizardmen need him the most. At the brink of desolation, when all hope seems lost, his sudden emergence has turned the tide of many pivotal battles. With a natural instinct for leadership and strategy, he doesn't just fight; he leads the lizardmen, ensuring their survival and victory against overwhelming odds.

To the lizardmen, The Wanderer isn't just a warrior; he's a living legend, a spirit of the jungle, and an avatar of the gods. Every time he appears, they shower him with sacred relics, adding to his already vast collection of ceremonial adornments. These aren't mere gifts; they are tokens of reverence and sacrifice, symbolizing their deep devotion and dependence on the divine forces The Wanderer embodies.

Every creature of the wanderer's choice within 120 feet of it that can hear the roar must succeed a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for one minute. Creatures frightened this way that end their turn 10 feet or more away from the wanderer can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Additionally, the wanderer and allies of its choice within 120 feet of it enter a rampage for one minute. While rampaging this way, their weapon attacks deal an additional 5 (1d10) damage.

>
> ### Legendary Actions

### Mythic Battle:<Br> Favor of the Old Ones
For a mythic encounter with The Wanderer, increase his hit points to 600 HP and enhance his Primal Roar trait with the following effects. His Challenge Rating (CR) increases to 23.
Primal Roar Modification: The Wanderer's Primal Roar trait changes such that it triggers three different times as his hit points drop to 450, 300, and 150 rather than only triggering once. The damage bonus granted to allies from each roar can stack, and a single instance of damage to The Wanderer can trigger multiple roars.

Each time Primal Roar is triggered, a unique set of effects occurs. These effects persist until The Wanderer is reduced to 0 hit points or 10 minutes has passed.

#### 1st Roar (450 HP): The God of Beasts
The Wanderer's roar summons a **razorsaur** in an unoccupied space it can see within 300 feet, subject to the following conditions:
* The summoned razorsaur has an initiative count of 20 and benefits from the effects of the roar that called it forth, including having the rampaging condition.
* This razorsaur remains for 10 minutes or until either it or The Wanderer are reduced to 0 hit points.
* Each subsequent use of The Wanderer's Primal Roar will summon another razorsaur in the same manner.

#### 2nd Roar (300 HP): The God of Storms
The Wanderer's roar summons a tempest blows around The Wanderer (30 miles per hour) and moves with it, remaining centered on it. The tempest is up to 1 mile high with a diameter of 150 feet. The Wanderer can choose any number of creatures to be unaffected by the storm, but all other creatures suffer the following effects while in its area:
* The storm is difficult terrain for flying creatures.
* Ranged attacks that travel more than 30 feet through the storm automatically miss.
* On initiative count 20, every creature within the storm must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet toward its center.



\columnbreak


#### 3rd Roar: The God of Protection
The Wanderer's roar creates a glowing 30-foot cube of shimmering magical protection centered on himself. He can choose any creatures within the area of the cube to be rendered immune to all forms of damage while they continue to be within it. The cube stays in one location and doesn't move with The Wanderer.

### The Wanderer Tactics 
The Wanderer excels in brutal melee combat. While formidable on his own, he becomes even more effective when supported by ranged creatures. These allies help compensate for his lack of long-range capabilities, and they work especially well together when the allies can benefit from The Wanderer's Hulking Protector feature.

The Wanderer possesses an innate knack for battle tactics, akin to an animal's hunting instincts, and he can expertly maneuver both himself and his minions to target the most vulnerable foes.

When selecting from his attack options, you can make the following considerations:

**Mighty Swing.** This allows The Wanderer to use his maul to decimate the densest clusters of enemies on the battlefield.

**Vice-like Jaws.** This is effective against skirmishers like rogues and monks or ranged attackers. It prevents them from escaping, and The Wanderer can even move a grappled target into a cluster of enemies, setting them up for his devastating Mighty Swing.

**Raking Claw.** This attack is most effective against targets with low AC, ensuring that both claws hit their mark.

**Tail Trip.** Targets with low Strength are especially susceptible to this move and make for ideal targets.

#### Primal Roar
Once The Wanderer's Primal Roar ability triggers, all tactical considerations are cast aside in favor of pure bloodshed. However, he retains the capacity to utilize his legendary actions in the most tactically advantageous ways possible.


#### Mythic Encounter
The Wanderer's mythic battle presents a formidable challenge for a player party, demanding significant counterplay strategies.

For The Wanderer, there are few decisions to make. The primary tactical consideration involves positioning the razorsaurs upon their arrival. It's important to note that the newly-summoned razorsaur, in their rampaging state, will hurl spikes at the closest target. Ideally, they should be positioned to target ranged or flying attackers, which The Wanderer struggles to counter.

### The Wanderer Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from The Wanderer are the remains of the equipment he was using or valuables he was carrying. Though crox don't often collect these items themselves, other lizardmen often adorn them with bones, jewelry, and ornaments of precious metal for ceremonial purposes, and The Wanderer is decorated with the most sacred of these items. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Because a battle against The Wanderer will likely be a major turning point in the adventure, it will often be a good idea to include a treasure hoard of the appropriate level as loot in addition to what's listed here.

#### The Wanderer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### The Wanderer Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Item |
|  10-11 | 1 1,000gp Item | 
|  12-17 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items  |  
|  18-23 | 1d6(3) 1,000gp Items |  
|  24+ |  1d6(3) 2,000gp Items |  


##### The Wanderer Mythic Loot Table
