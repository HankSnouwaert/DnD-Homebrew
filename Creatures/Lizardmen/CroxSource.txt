## Crox

Within the enigmatic lizardmen society, the crox stand as towering sentinels, dedicated protectors, and potent laborers. They are hulking creatures, towering above other lizardfolk. Their bodies are covered in armored scales, ranging in colors from deep blues to vivid greens and earthy browns. Their heads resemble a blend of crocodile and lizard, featuring jaws capable of crushing stone and metal. Their powerful limbs, which end in deadly claws, enable them to move with surprising speed for their size.

> ##### The Rampaging Condition
> Many creatures in this document have abilities that cause them to enter a rampage. Rampages last for one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: <br>
> &#8226;  Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.<br>
> &#8226; The creature must take the Attack action on each of its turns, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see unless there are no creatures it can reach with an attack. <br>
> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>
> &#8226;  The creature can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

The crox serve as the backbone of the lizardmen’s physical endeavors. In times of peace, they perform hard labor, assisting in the construction of temples, moving massive stone blocks, and dredging channels in the marshes. During war, they stand at the forefront of the Lizardfolk’s armies, swinging colossal weapons and smashing through enemy lines with their sheer might. 

While they are unmatched in physical strength, the Crox possess a simpler intellect than their smaller kin. As a result, they are often guided and directed by lizardmen leaders or skinks. Their loyalty to their kin is unwavering, and they carry out their tasks with a dedication that is both admirable and, at times, frightening.

### Sacred Crox

Some crox warriors are chosen to become something greater, something revered and sacred. These sacred crox, embody the very spirit of the gods the lizardmen worship. Not every crox has the potential to undergo this transformation. The process starts when skink shamen receive divine visions in their meditations, hinting at a particular crox that has been chosen by the gods. These crox are then taken to sacred groves, where they undergo rigorous rituals, awakening their latent divine power.

The Sacred Guardians are distinct from their Crox brethren. Their scales shimmer with an ethereal glow, reflecting hues that seem impossible in the natural world. Depending on the deity they are connected with, their eyes may burn with the cool blue of a serene lake, the fierce red of a blazing fire, or the deep green of the densest forest. And, while any crox could be spawned with unique markings displaying the blessings of one of their gods, the sacred crox are much more likely to carry these blessings, and their scales shine with the power they bestow.

In battle, sacred crox are equipped with ornate gauntlets designed to channel their divine power into devesting blows. The strikes delivered with these weapons are not just capable of shattering bone, but unleashing radiant blasts of divine power. Sacred crox lumber into battle with these weapons, often using them to knuckle walk, before barrelling into foes and smashing them to a bloody pulp.

One group of sacred crox warriors have gained a special notoriety among enemies and allies alike. Known as the storm warriors, these crox have received special blessings from the lizardmen storm god. Their bodies are infused with the storm god's divine might, allowing them to channel lightning through their sacred gauntlets. Their blows statically charge their prey, leaving them with supernatural wounds that make them vulnerable to continued assaults. Storm warriors and their allies can use this tactic to quickly take down even the sturdiest foes with their divine onslaught.

### Crox Ancients
The crox ancients stand as living relics of the lizardfolk's past. These behemoths, blessed with extended lifespans, are easily distinguished by their colossal size, weathered scales, and the moss or lichen that grows on their forms, symbolizing their deep connection to the land.

Their longevity grants them a unique blend of instinctual war knowledge and experiential wisdom. Though they are not traditional thinkers, their primal understanding of combat and strategy makes them unparalleled tacticians. They lead not with complex orders, but with actions and guttural roars and shouts that their troops instinctively understand, creating a primal unity on the battlefield.

Crox ancients often wander the wilds, battling mighty beasts to test themselves as they grow stronger and wiser over the centuries. They have an uncanny knack for showing up when lizardmen forces are overwhelmed and in disarray. With their imposing aura of power and authority, they rally and lead whole lizardmen armies into battle where the crox ancient can unleash its titanic strength upon its hapless foes. Despite their ancient wisdom, they often lose themselves to bloodlust in battle, unleashing a primordial fury so terrible it scars the minds of those who witness it.

### Crox Tactics


Crox are inherently primal brutes, often attacking the nearest opponent out of pure instinct. These behemoths may fight using simple tactics and mindless aggression when on their own, but their true potential is unlocked when they are guided by smaller, more intelligent creatures, such as skinks.

In the hierarchy of Lizardmen, crox serve as formidable bodyguards and frontline soldiers. Although savage by nature, they display a surprising kinship with skinks. This unlikely alliance leads to the crox fiercely protecting skinks, even willing to risk their own lives to protect their allies unless instructed otherwise by a trusted skink companion.

The tactics described here are designed for use when crox are fighting alongside skinks but can be equally effective with other small, skirmishing humanoid units paired with crox.

Typically, the crox form the front line, advancing on the enemy. Directly behind them, the skinks utilize the crox's massive size as a protective wall. During their turn, the skinks maneuver through the crox to either engage any enemy units already in combat with the crox or, if the crox have yet to engage, to carry out ranged attacks.

Once their attacks are complete, the skinks retreat to safety behind the crox. They can also opt to use their bonus action to hide, leveraging the crox as cover if they possess the **Vanish** feature.

Should a crox go into a rampage, the skinks remain by its side until the battle appears lost or the crox can no longer provide sufficient cover.

#### Sacred Crox

Though sacred crox are more powerful than their ordinary kin and possess different types of weapons, they fight using the same tactics as typical crox. 

#### Blessings of the Old Ones
Crox with different blessings will follow mostly the same tactics as normal warriors, making small adjustments <br> to maximum their blessing's effect as nessecary. If <br> they have blessings that work with the rampage <Br> condition, there may be more circumstances <Br> in which they use their bite to try and enter <br> a rampage early.

\columnbreak


#### Crox Storm Warriors
Under the guidance of a more intelligent strategist, one or more storm warriors will concentrate their efforts on a single target, attempting to inflict as many Static Wounds as possible. Given that these wounds vanish after a round of not being hit by one of the storm warriors, the skink handlers encourage the crox to take substantial risks to maintain the infliction of these wounds on high-priority targets.

Any skinks concealed behind the cohort will simultaneously concentrate their attacks on the now weakened target, utilizing javelins and poison. The weakened state of the target makes it more susceptible to these attacks, increasing the likelihood of successful hits and, thus, effective poisoning.


#### Crox Ancients
Despite their lack of conventional intelligence, Kroxigor Ancients possess an almost instinctual sense of strategy and warfare. They can implement rudimentary tactics and issue near-animalistic commands to other crox, although they operate more like a pack of beasts than a unit of soldiers.
While crox ancients demonstrate greater intellect than their counterparts, they are most effective when paired with skinks, who serve as their advisors.

For optimal strategic placement, the crox ancients should be situated in the center of their group's formation. This position maximizes the benefit of its Aura of Endurance trait and its Coordinated Maul attack.

However, when a crox ancient begins to rampage, if there are no skinks nearby to maintain order, all crox in the vicinity lose any semblance of strategic cohesion.

### Crox Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from crox are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Though crox don't often collect these items themselves, other lizardmen often adorn them with bones, hide, and jewelry for ceremonial purposes. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Crox Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
