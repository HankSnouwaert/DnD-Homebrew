> ##### The Rampaging Condition
> Many creatures in this document have abilities that cause them to enter a rampage. Rampages last for one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: <br>
> &#8226;  Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.<br>
> &#8226; The creature must take the Attack action on each of its turns, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see unless there are no creatures it can reach with an attack. <br>
> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>
> &#8226;  The creature can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

> ##### Optional Crox Reaction: Avenge Kindred
> If you're pairing your crox with skinks, you can give them the following reaction to help them work better together:<br>
> ***Avenge Kindred.*** When a creature the crox can see deals damage to a skink within 30 feet of the crox that reduces its hit points to 0, the crox enters a rampage that lasts one minute and immediately moves up to its speed towards the creature and makes a melee weapon attack against it with advantage if it is within reach. 


 ***Primeval Mask.*** The skink has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage or a creature larger than it and may do so even if it is only lightly obscured while hiding this way.

### Crox Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from crox are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Though crox don't often collect these items themselves, other lizardmen often adorn them with bones, hide, and jewelry for ceremonial purposes. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Crox Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
