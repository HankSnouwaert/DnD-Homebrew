## Lord Mazhalmundi
*Ancient Mage-Priest & Arbiter of The Great Plan*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual <br>

Among the hoary mage-priests who, in ages past, wielded immense magical power to shape the world according to the designs of the Old Ones, none surpass Lord Mazhalmundi in age or arcane might. These ancient spellcasters were created to enact the will of godlike beings from beyond the stars—creatures who came to a primordial world and sought to mold it into a perfect design. Of those mage-priests who still survive into the present age, Mazhalmundi stands alone as the greatest. His power eclipses that of his peers, and his mind still carries echoes of the instructions handed down by the Old Ones themselves.

At the dawn of the world, Mazhalmundi was instructed in the arcane arts by the greatest of the mage-priests—those who spoke directly with the Old Ones themselves. So vast was his power that he could topple mountains and carve gaping rivers, shaping the world to the specifications of his divine creators. Yet, even with the mage-priests' masterful spellcraft and the Old Ones’ unmatched might, their vision for the world was never fulfilled. A calamity of unimaginable magnitude befell the planet, causing the Old Ones to vanish—whether slain in the cataclysm or abandoning their creations remains a mystery, even to the most learned mage-priests. Those who survived the initial devastation were soon assailed by abominations born from the chaos, which ravaged the land and plunged it into further discord.

In the wars that followed, all of the greatest mage-priests were lost in battle. Mazhalmundi and many of his kin had their minds tainted by the same chaos that had unmade the realms—their thoughts and calculations obscured by the disorder that flowed about them like a thick fog. Many entered deep trances in an effort to realign their minds and discern what must be done now that the Old Ones no longer guided their path.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

As the ages passed, Mazhalmundi remained motionless within his golden temple, hidden in the deepest jungles and protected by vigilant lizardmen who guarded the ancient sage for generations, awaiting his awakening.

In recent days, as the younger races arrogantly journey to forgotten lands to plunder and conquer, many relics left behind by the Old Ones have fallen into the hands of fools with no reverence or understanding of their true power. In his transcendent state, Mazhalmundi sensed this growing threat—and he rose once more. Over countless years, he had purged his mind of the corruption that hinders his brethren and reclaimed a portion of his former might. He has now determined what must be done to continue the Old Ones’ designs.

Mazhalmundi has concluded that before any new phase of the plan can begin, all species not crafted by the Old Ones must be eliminated—for their very existence disrupts the divine blueprint and halts the progress of its orderly fulfillment.

With these revelations fixed within the spellcaster’s unfathomable mind, his pronouncements echo psychically across the world. The oracles and lesser mage-priests of the lizardmen have heard his decree and gathered their forces to purge the mistakes that plague the world.

As for Mazhalmundi himself, he prepares to leave his sanctum, placing his great stone palanquin upon the fiercest of ceradon bound to his will. Atop this mighty beast, those he deems unworthy of the Old Ones' plan are swept aside with a wave of his amphibious hand, as the winds of magic bend to fuel his devastating incantations. Once Mazhalmundi passes judgment, no plea or protest can sway him—for the Great Work permits no clemency.

#### Epic Battle: Herald of The Great Plan
If you wish to make Mazhalmundi into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you may have him ride atop his mighty ceradon steed **Zloq**. Together, they have a CR of 29.

\columnbreak

#### Devastation of Cities

You may give Mazhalmundi the Devastation of Cities set of actions described below; this increases his CR by 2.

<br>

> ### The Devastation of Cities
> **Cosmic Power.** When Mazhalmundi rolls initiative, he selects a point he can see and calls upon the Cosmic Powers to rend the earth. These entities, which possess an Intelligence of 24, act autonomously and always in Mazhalmundi’s best interest. For the next minute, or until Mazhalmundi dies, the Cosmic Powers remain active. While active, they are aware of the location of any creature within 120 feet of the chosen point.
>
> **Tremors - Occurs On Initiative Count 30 (Losing Ties).** The Cosmic Powers select a point within 300 feet of Mazhalmundi. A shockwave erupts from that point, forming a 90-foot-long, 30-foot-wide wave of upheaval that travels along the ground in a direction of the Powers’ choosing. The affected area becomes difficult terrain and begins to shake violently. Each creature of the Cosmic Powers’ choice standing on the ground in the area must succeed on a *Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 24*.
> 
> *Failure:* The creature is knocked Prone and cannot stand unless it uses all of its movement to do so on its next turn.
> 
> *Failure By 5+:* The creaure becomes buried, as the ground collapses beneath it. A buried creature is Restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free it with a DC 24 Strength check. This check has advantage if the creature attempting it has a Burrow speed.
>
> **Fissure - Occurs On Initiative Count 0 (Losing Ties).** 
The affected ground collapses, forming a fissure 40 feet deep and as wide as the original tremors. If the terrain is shallower than 40 feet, the fissure opens into whatever lies beneath (such as caverns or lava). Each creature and unattended object in the area must make a  *Dexterity Saving Throw: DC 24*.
>
>*Failure:* The creature falls Prone and into the fissure, taking 6d6 Bludgeoning damage, plus any damage from falling. 
>
> *Failure By 5+:* The creature is buried under rubble. A buried creature is Restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free it with a DC 24 Strength check, with advantage if the rescuer has a Burrow speed.

>
> ***Unstoppable.*** Zloq’s movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells or other magical effects can neither reduce its speed nor move or teleport it against its will.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Zloq makes a Stomp attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of it, then makes either a Gore or Bite attack. It can forgo all of its Stomp attacks to instead use its Trample action.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target not in Zloq’s space. *Hit:* 24 (3d10 + 7) Piercing damage. If Zloq moves at least 20 feet straight toward the target before making this attack, the target takes an additional 16 (3d10) Piercing damage. If the target is a creature, Zloq impales it on its horns, grappling it if it is Large or smaller (escape DC 24). While grappled, the target is Restrained and takes 24 (3d10 + 7) Piercing damage at the start of each of Zloq’s turns—or 40 (6d10 + 7) if Zloq is Rampaging. Zloq cannot use its Gore attack while a creature is impaled this way.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) Piercing damage.
>
> ***Stomp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (2d12 + 7) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is Prone and in the same space as Zloq, the attack instead deals 33 (4d12 + 7) Bludgeoning damage. If Zloq is Rampaging and the target is Prone, the attack is a critical hit, and the creature is paralyzed until the start of Zloq’s next turn.
>
> ***Trample.*** Zloq moves up to its speed in a straight line. During this movement, it can attempt to enter the spaces of Large or smaller creatures if it has moved at least 10 feet in a straight line beforehand. A creature whose space Zloq would enter must make a *Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw (target’s choice):* DC 24. <br>
> *Failure:* The creature falls Prone, takes 20 (2d12 + 7) Bludgeoning damage, and Zloq moves into its space. <br>
> *Successful Dexterity Save:* The creature takes no damage, is not knocked Prone, and is pushed 5 feet to the nearest space out of Zloq’s path. <br>
> *Successful Strength Save:* The creature takes half damage, is not knocked Prone, and Zloq’s movement ends. <br>
> If Zloq ends its movement in a Prone creature’s space, that creature is also Restrained until it is no longer in the same space as Zloq. While Restrained in this way, the creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 24 Strength check. On a success, the Restrained creature is pulled to an unoccupied space of its choice within 5 feet of Zloq and is no longer Restrained.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Armoured Crest.*** *Trigger:* An attacker that Zloq can see makes an attack roll against it or a creature within 5 feet of it. <br>
> *Response:* Zloq imposes disadvantage on the attack roll.

### Mazhalmundi Tactics
Unlike typical spellcasters, Mazhalmundi leverages his cobra mace, immunity to his own spells, and mount Zloq to engage enemies up close. If Zloq dies, he falls back, keeping distance and striking lone vulnerable targets with his mace.

Mazhalmundi casts spells in the following priority order, adapting based on circumstances (e.g., enemy positions, statuses, or threats):

1. **Titanic Growth:** Cast on Zloq pre-combat if possible. (If he cannot cast it before combat starts, he prioritizes casting it immediately after Maddening Darkness.)
2. **Maddening Darkness:** Cast to maximize upfront damage before foes close in. Mazhalmundi is unaffected, so he centers it on himself for optimal coverage.
3. **Psychic Scream:** Prioritize hitting as many targets as possible.
4. **Eruption:** Target clusters of low-Dexterity or Stunned foes. Alternatively, cast into a fissure from The Ruination of Cities if 2+ creatures are trapped inside.
5. **Wrath of the Four Winds:** Use to shove low-Strength or Stunned targets back into Maddening Darkness/Eruption zones, or reposition them for Zloq's trample.
6. **Horrid Wilting:** Target as many low-Constitution foes as possible.
7. **Storm of Renewal:** Cast if Mazhalmundi or Zloq are Bloodied, or if either has suffered Poison, Blindness, or Paralysis.
8. **Sunburst:** Target groups of low-Constitution enemies.
9. **Rebounding Blades:** Hit clusters of low-Dexterity targets. Zloq can restrain foes in position to ensure they take returning blade damage.

\columnbreak

>  ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * Any Charmed or Frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.

<br>

#### Melee and Utility Actions:
* **Cobra Mace:** Use on unpoisoned targets, prioritizing spellcasters or those attuned to multiple powerful magic items.
* **Shift:** Reposition Zloq to trample multiple targets. Avoid teleporting if Zloq already has Restrained targets.
* **Adaptive Healing:** Each turn, select a damage type Mazhalmundi believes enemies cannot easily exploit against him.

#### Zloq Tactics
Zloq capitalizes on openings from Mazhalmundi's spells (e.g., Psychic Scream or Wrath of the Four Winds) by charging in to skewer foes on his horns, then dragging them into Maddening Darkness or Eruption zones for more damage.

#### The Ruination of Cities
These actions create fissures along the ground to block escaping foes (e.g., from Maddening Darkness) or drop Stunned targets into hazards.

##### Lord Mazhalmundi Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Unraveling Fault.** Lord Mazhalmundi has declared that a tectonic rift must be widened to realign continental convergence according to the Old Ones’ plan. To achieve this, he commands vast magical energies to rupture a heavily populated region, triggering earthquakes and awakening ancient volcanoes. As refugees flee and the land begins to shatter, the adventurers must uncover what cosmic threat he perceives and how to end the devastation.  |
|  2  |**Lost & Found.** A rising religious order worships the Old Ones in flawed, human-centric terms, and Mazhalmundi deems them a heretical threat to ancient world-runes buried beneath their temple. He commands their immediate extermination, and lizardfolk armies march in silence to fulfill his decree. |
|  3  |**The Star That Should Not Shine.** When a new celestial body appears in the sky, Mazhalmundi identifies it as a remnant of an ancient foe and begins constructing a titanic beacon to tear it from the heavens. Scholars and star-priests warn that disturbing the star could unravel planar stability, but the mage-priest remains unmoved. To prevent a cosmic rupture—or prove the star’s true purpose—the adventurers must act before the beacon ignites. |
|  4  | **The Fallen Void Vessel.** An enormous object crashes in the distant jungle—sleek, alien, and clearly artificial. Mazhalmundi declares it a remnant of the Old Ones' final departure and orders it sealed, even as explorers and empires rush to claim it. The adventurers may be hired by a faction to reach the wreck, discover its contents, or determine why the mage-priest wants it locked away.| 

### Lord Mazhalmundi Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from sload mage-priests are the ancient relics they carry with them. However, some more macabre looters may harvest their remains for materials that hold some lingering power. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** checks. At the DM's discretion, harvesting their bodies can be done using an **Intelligence (Medicine)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Lord Mazhalmundi Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### New Lord <br> Mazhalmundi Spells  

#### Disruptive Pulse
*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a wave of nullifying energy toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Thunder damage.

If the target is concentrating on a spell and must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, you can choose to set the saving throw DC equal to your spell save DC instead of the normal DC.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

#### Eruption 
*8th-level evocation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Wizard, Sorcerer

You choose a point you can see on the ground within range. The ground cracks and a burst of magma erupts in a 60-foot-radius, 120-foot-high cylinder centered on that point. Each creature in the affected area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d12 fire damage and 4d12 bludgeoning damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

Additionally, the ground in the area becomes superheated for 1 minute. The area becomes difficult terrain, and any creature that ends its turn in the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 4d12 fire damage, or half as much on a successful save.

After the area cools down, it remains difficult terrain until cleared. Each 5-foot-square portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.

#### Rebounding Blades 
*8th-level Conjuration (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small magnet)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You conjure three spinning blades of returning and launch them outwards. Each blade appears in an unoccupied 5-foot cube adjacent to you and immediately flies up to 100 feet in a straight line in a direction of your choice. The blades hover at their destinations until the start of your next turn, at which point they move back toward you in straight lines. A blade disappears when it reaches you or after it has traveled a total of 100 feet.

\columnbreak

The first time a blade enters a creature’s space (other than yours) during its initial flight or return, that creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d10 Slashing damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 2d10 for every slot level above 8.

#### Storm of Renewal
*8th-level Conjuration (Druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You summon a healing storm that takes the form of a raincloud in a 30-foot-radius, 10-foot-tall cylinder, centered on a point you can see within range directly above you. The cloud persists for the duration, releasing restorative rain that extinguishes exposed flames and washes away acid or slime covering the area.

When you cast the spell, and again at the start of each of your turns for the duration, you can choose up to three creatures within the cylinder. Each selected creature regains 4d8 hit points, and you can end one disease or one condition affecting it. The condition can be Blinded, Deafened, Paralyzed, or Poisoned.

#### Titanic Growth
*8th-level Transmutation (Druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a seed)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You cause a willing creature within range to tap into its primal essence, transforming into a colossal, bestial form. For the duration, the target gains the following benefits:
- The target’s size becomes Gargantuan (if it was smaller).
- If its Strength score is less than 19, it becomes 19 for the duration.
- It gains 50 temporary hit points for the duration of the spell.
- Its speed increases by 20 feet.
- It gains a +2 bonus to AC.
- It gains a +2 bonus to Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- Its attacks with enlarged weapons or unarmed strikes deal an extra 2d8 damage on a hit.

#### Wrath of the Four Winds
*8th-level Evocation (Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small leaf)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon the might of the four winds to buffet your enemies. Choose up to four creatures within range. Each creature must make a Strength saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature is pushed up to 60 feet in a direction of your choice (you may choose a different direction for each creature). If it is pushed into a solid surface or into another creature that also failed its saving throw, the pushed creature takes 6d8 Bludgeoning damage, is knocked Prone, and is Dazed* until the end of your next turn.

If a pushed creature would collide with another creature that did not fail its saving throw, that second creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, both it and the pushed creature take 6d8 Bludgeoning damage, are knocked Prone, and become Dazed* until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, both take half damage and suffer no other effects.

On a successful Strength save, a creature is pushed up to 15 feet in a direction of your choice and suffers no further effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 2d8 for every slot level above 8.

**New condition described below*

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
