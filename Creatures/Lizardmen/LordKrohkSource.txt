## Lord Krohc
*Mummified Mage-Priest Empowered By An Undying Spirit*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual <br>

The sload mage-priests who survived the perilous eons since their creation by the Old Ones are mere shadows compared to the greatest of their kind who existed at the dawn of the world. The first sload mage-priests, forged by the Old Ones, were imbued with a supreme understanding of the universe, granting them power surpassed only by their creators. With a gesture, they could conjure hurricanes or rivers, weave spells to raise continents from the ocean floor, or plunge them back into the depths. Such was their mastery over the winds of magic.

Among them, the greatest was Lord Krohc, said to be the first of his kind to come into existence. No other being possessed a deeper understanding of the Old Ones' plans for the world, and only the most powerful beings could rival the might of this unparalleled servant. Yet even his immense power was tested during the Great Cataclysm that claimed the Old Ones and engulfed the world in chaos. Despite the combined efforts of the first generation of mage-priests, their powers were barely sufficient to fend off the evil born of that disaster. The salvation of the world came at a terrible cost: the loss of the greatest spellcasters to ever grace existence.

It is said that Lord Krohc was the last of his kind to fall. For years, he tirelessly held back an army of nightmares as vast as an ocean, casting spells with enough arcane might to topple mountains. Ultimately, his horrific foes overwhelmed him, tearing him apart. With his final breath, Lord Krohc unleashed a spell that swept away the remnants of his murderers, preserving what remained of the Old Ones' grand design.

After the dust settled, the surviving servants of the Old Ones searched vigilantly for every scattered piece of the torn sage. They reunited his remains, binding them with sacred rites and placing them once more upon his stone palanquin. A golden death mask, inset with snow-white jewels for eyes, was laid upon the body of the mighty spellcaster so that he might continue to witness the flow of fate.

To this day, Lord Krohc's remains are housed within the most sacred temple of the Old Ones, guarded by lizardmen and revered by other sload mage-priests who offer tribute. Lord Krohc has become a symbol of the era when the Old Ones' plans remained untainted. Yet, Lord Krohc remains unconquerable, for his soul clings stubbornly to his withered corpse, refusing to depart this world. Those who visit the mage-priest's tomb feel the presence of his spirit, and some claim divine revelations, believing that Krohc still seeks to guide the children of the lost gods.

In the direst times—when the enemies of the Old Ones resurface or an omen reveals a fragment of the great plan demanding swift action—the sload mage-priests carry the mummified saint from his resting place, borne by his lizardfolk guardians. When roused, the spirit of Lord Krohc can draw celestial power to replicate the final spell he cast in life. Though its destructive force is minuscule when compared with the earthshaking incantation unleashed at the end of his life, it remains capable of grinding armies to dust once the venerable mage-priest's spirit completes his ritual.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Annul.*** If Lord Krohc fails a saving throw, he can choose to expend a Level of Power to succeed instead.
>
> ***Hypnotic Death Mask.*** Whenever any creature tries to attack Lord Krohc for the first time on a turn, the attacker must make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 22. <br>
> *Failure:* The creature is Charmed by Lord Krohc until the end of the turn, and it must choose a new target for its attack or the attack is wasted. <br>
> *Success:* The creature can attack Lord Krohc on this turn, but it has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against Lord Krohc’s spells on its next turn.
>
> ***Telepathic Shroud.*** Lord Krohc is immune to any effect that would sense his emotions or read his thoughts, as well as to all Divination spells.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Spatial Shift.*** Lord Krohc teleports up to 60 feet to a point he can see, one he can visualize, or one he can describe by stating distance and direction.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Eldritch Deliverance.*** Lord Krohc casts *Eldritch Deliverance*. His spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 22). The spell’s effective level is increased by 1 for each level of power the mage priest has.
>
> ***Arcane Blast.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 150 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 18 (2d10 + 7) Force damage.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Lord Krohc gains three additional actions in combat: Summmon Beacons, Essence Rend, and Resonating Pulse. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count (losing ties), separate from Lord Krohc’s own, if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace any action with Tenacious Will, and he can use Tenacious Will and Summmon Beacons even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Summmon Beacons (Initiative Count 30).*** Lord Krohc creates four Eldritch Beacons in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of himself. These Eldritch Beacons last until Initiative Count 30 of the next round. They act on their own turns on Initiative Count 1 and can only take the Infuse action on their turn.
>
> ***Essence Rend (Initiative Count 15).*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 150 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) Necrotic damage, and the target’s soul is Rended for the next minute. While Rended, the creature takes 22 (4d10) Necrotic damage on Initiative Count 16 (losing ties) of each round. The effect ends early if the target regains 20 or more hit points in a single turn, or if a *Dispel Evil and Good* or *Greater Restoration* spell is cast on the target.
>
> ***Resonating Pulse (Initiative Count 5).*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 150 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 29 (4d10 + 7) Thunder damage, and the target is surrounded by rippling energy for the next minute. While surrounded by rippling energy, the creature is Restrained. If a creature other than Lord Krohc within 10 feet of the target casts a 1st-level or higher spell, the caster takes 22 (4d10) Thunder damage, and the rippling energy dissipates.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Lord Krohc is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

### Epic Battle: Indomitable Spirit
When Lord Krohc dies, you may choose to have his spirit rise from the remains. The spirit has the same stat block as Lord Krohc, except it has the following changes:

* The spirit loses the Golden Death Mask trait.
* The spirit is immune to all damage, as well as being Charmed, Exhausted, frightened, Grappled, Paralyzed, Petrified, Poisoned, Prone, or Restrained.
* The spirit can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) Force damage, which ignores all damage immunities, if it ends its turn inside an object.
* Soul Struggle: Any creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the spirit may choose to Struggle with the spirit. The Struggle lasts as long as the creature maintains concentration (as if concentrating on a spell) or until the spirit dies, up to a maximum of 10 minutes. While Struggling with the spirit, the creature ignores the spirit’s damage immunities. If the concentration breaks while the spirit is alive, the creature takes 27 (6d8) Force damage and is Dazed* until the end of its next turn.


Lord Krohc's spirit may perform an 8-hour ritual to his original body, fully restoring him, or providing a new body if the original no longer exists.

When Lord Krohc has access to this ability, both forms combined are treated as a CR 28 creature.

### Lord Krohc's Tactics

Lord Krohc’s primary objective in battle is to protect both himself and his Eldritch Beacons, ensuring he can gather enough power to unleash Eldritch Deliverance and annihilate his foes. He relies on his flight to stay mobile and out of reach of most threats.

**Eldritch Deliverance.** Lord Krohc casts Eldritch Deliverance every turn if possible. He prioritizes targeting the maximum number of enemies, but will focus specifically on creatures that suffer disadvantage on the saving throw due to his Hypnotic Death Mask trait.

**Summon Beacon.** The Eldritch Beacons are deliberately placed as far apart as possible to minimize the risk of being caught by area-of-effect spells. 

**Essence Rend.** This attack is used against a creature with the lowest AC that is not yet wounded.

**Resonating Pulse.** This attack targets a melee martial fighter that is unable to cast spells, making it as hard as possible to remove the resonating energy.

**Annul.** Used whenever there is something incapacitating Lord Krohc or preventing him from casting spells. 

#### Lord Krohc Epic Battle

Lord Krohc’s tactics remain relatively the same, except that he focuses on breaking the concentration of creatures Struggling with his spirit.

\columnbreak

#### New Spell: Eldritch Deliverance
*1st-level Evocation (Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of meteorite)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a sudden pulse of eldritch energy at a point you can see within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 Force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 2d6, the radius increases by 5 feet, and the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

##### Lord Krohc Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Echoes of the Final Spell.** An ancient battlefield, long buried beneath volcanic rock, suddenly surges with magic. Survivors whisper of glowing runes and ashstorms that move against the wind. Sload seers believe the residual energy of Lord Krohc’s final spell has become unstable, threatening to erupt again. The adventurers must descend into the heart of the ruined valley to anchor the fading echo and potentially face a remnant of Krohc's spirit.  |
|  2  |**The Lost Fragment.** An ancient vault believed lost since the Great Cataclysm has been discovered—within it lies a shard of Lord Krohc's original body, believed destroyed. This fragment pulses with arcane resonance, and several factions want it for themselves, claiming it holds spells lost to time. The adventurers may be tasked with retrieving or destroying the fragment before it falls into the wrong hands. |
|  3  |**The Echo War.** In an ancient memory vault beneath the temple-city, the adventurers activate a long-forgotten geomantic interface that replays the final hours of Lord Krohc’s last battle—complete with real enemies, magical terrain, and Lord Krohc himself reconstructed as a projection of war. But something goes wrong, and the simulation locks in place. Now fully aware, Krohc’s echo mistakes the adventurers for agents of chaos, and the party must survive his wrath in a gauntlet forged from the past. |
|  4  | **The Disturbed Slumber.** During a full celestial alignment, an opportunistic faction attempts to resurrect Lord Krohc entirely, believing they can return him to life to serve their own ends. The ritual succeeds only in disorienting and enraging Krohc's spirit. The adventurers must either subdue the rampaging entity or complete a different ritual to bring him peace once more.|

### Lord Krohc Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from sload mage-priests are the ancient relics they carry with them. However, some more macabre looters may harvest their remains for materials that hold some lingering power. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** checks. At the DM's discretion, harvesting their bodies can be done using an **Intelligence (Medicine)** check. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Lord Krohc Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
