## Carnosaurs

In the dense jungles and vast plains where the Lizardmen thrive, few creatures strike as much awe and terror as the mighty Carnosaurs. These apex predators, with their fearsome presence and unmatched power, are both revered and feared, serving as powerful mounts for the most powerful lizardmen generals.

Carnosaurs are colossal reptilian beasts, standing several times taller than even the largest Lizardmen. Their muscular bodies, covered in thick, rugged scales, bear powerful limbs and a tail that acts both as a counterbalance and a weapon. Their maws are lined with razor-sharp teeth, capable of tearing apart even the toughest of foes. Among the various subspecies, some Carnosaurs sport varying amounts of feathers, adding a unique blend of ferocity and beauty to their appearance.

A Carnosaur on the battlefield is a sight of raw, primal power. These beasts are known for their bloody rampages, cutting through enemy lines with devastating ease. Their jaws and talons deliver grievous wounds, which, more often than not, result in the victim bleeding out over time. The scent of this spilled blood only intensifies the Carnosaur's bloodlust.

They often enter feeding frenzies upon tasting it, making them all the more aggressive and insatiable when zeroing in on their bleeding prey.

Such is the might of the Carnosaurs that only the most influential Lizardmen commanders dare mount them for battle. Riding a Carnosaur is not about complete control but rather channeling its natural ferocity. Lizardmen riders, with their limited influence over these beasts, direct them towards the most optimal targets, letting the Carnosaur's instincts do the rest. 

It's a balance of guidance and unleashing raw power, a testament to the Lizardmen's symbiotic relationship with their environment.
Conclusion: Carnosaurs embody the raw essence of nature — unpredictable, unstoppable, and awe-inspiring. For the Lizardmen, these creatures are not just tools of war but symbols of primal might and their civilization's enduring bond with the ancient forces of the world. In every thunderous step and every devastating charge, Carnosaurs remind all of the primal force that the Lizardmen command.

### Guldbloom's Terror 

There is one carnosaur of particular infamy known as Guldbloom's Terror. Named after the ill-fated explorer Jeffory Guldbloom, this creature is more than just a testament to the land's primal dangers. It's a living nightmare that has become the stuff of legends, told in hushed tones around campfires.

Jeffory Guldbloom, a renowned explorer and naturalist, arrived in the Lizardmen homeland with the noble intention of studying its diverse dinosaur fauna. However, during his expedition, his team came across a carnosaur unlike any they'd seen – an apex predator with unparalleled intelligence and power. Rather than being the observer, Guldbloom quickly found himself and his team the observed. One by one, members of his expedition vanished, leaving only signs of a fierce struggle. The group soon realized they were being hunted by this very carnosaur, leading to its grim title, Guldbloom's Terror.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Unlike its kin, Guldbloom's Terror does not rely on sheer force but utilizes stealth and cunning, and its eyes burn with an uncanny intelligence. The creature's hunting technique sets it apart. Abandoning the carnosaur's usual straightforward assault, this beast specializes in ambush attacks. Its scaled hide allows it to blend seamlessly into the dense jungle, setting up perfect ambush points for its prey. What truly terrifies explorers and warriors alike is its methodical approach. Once it marks a target, Guldbloom's Terror hunts with chilling precision, using its environment to stalk, corner, and eventually strike with deadly efficiency.

Guldbloom's final notes, found abandoned near a destroyed campsite, spoke of the creature with a mix of fear and admiration. He wrote of its almost human-like ability to think, strategize, and execute plans. These notes serve as a grim reminder of the expedition's fate and a warning to all who dare tread in Guldbloom's Terror's territory.

If a creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 13), it is also stunned. At the end of each of the stunned creature's turns, and each time it takes damage, it can make another Wisdom saving throw against the effect. The target has advantage on the saving throw if it's triggered by damage. On a success, the effect ends. <br><br>

### Carnosaur Tactics


Carnosaurs are apex predators, unafraid of any other creature. At the slightest hint of movement, they charge, using their claws to wound their target, followed by a powerful biting attack that sends them into a rampage. They use their tail attack to hit a secondary threat, but always prioritize hitting their primary prey with claw and bite attacks.

Despite their straightforward rampaging tendencies, carnosaurs have some tactical options. Their Blood Tracking ability allows them to pursue the most wounded prey in the area, bypassing the limitations of their rampaging condition. This is especially useful if the wounded target tries to flee. However, outside of this tactic, they still adhere to the standard rampage rules.

The carnosaur's innate lust for blood drives it to attack the most injured target with claw and bite attacks. If that creature manages to heal its wounds, the carnosaur promptly shifts its attention to the next nearest prey.

When lizardmen use carnosaurs as mounts, they shouldn't be treated as fully under the control of their rider unless that rider possesses the 'Blessing of the Beast God' from the lizardmen Blessings of the Old Ones list. A rider without this blessing is limited to guiding the carnosaur toward the most prominent target on the battlefield to unleash its wounding attacks. However, once the carnosaur begins to rampage, the rider loses all control, and the creature behaves as if it were wild.


#### Guldbloom's Terror 

Guldbloom's Terror exhibits unparalleled cunning compared to other carnosaurs. With its ambush ability and the Jungle Stalker trait, it patiently waits for the perfect moment to strike an unsuspecting target, often choosing the largest prey. Despite its sly nature, this creature is fearless and prioritizes kills that offer the most sustenance.
Guldbloom's Terror employs the same tactics as a standard carnosaur but doesn't risk entering into a rampage. It focuses on the most injured target it can detect, tearing it apart with cold precision rather than reckless rampaging.

This carnosaur also possesses legendary actions used in specific situations:
Blood Tracking and Tenacious Will: These are employed whenever something prevents the carnosaur from attacking a severely wounded target.
Claw: The carnosaur uses this attack when it's adjacent to the most injured prey or if it aims to start wounding a new creature.
Bloody Roar: This ability is used when the carnosaur can affect four or more targets with it or if it can impact at least two targets that are either concentrating on spells or flying beyond its reach. Possessing a natural instinct for magic detection, if Guldbloom's Terror senses a spell of seventh level or higher being concentrated upon, it will seek to disrupt it this way.

### Carnosaur Loot
The valuable items looted from carnosaur will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a carnosaur. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Carnosaur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
