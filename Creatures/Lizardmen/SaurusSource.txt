## Saurus

Among the lizardmen civilization, the saurus are responsible for waging war and protecting their people. They are created for battle, emerging as fully formed adults from ancient spawning pools maintained by the lizardmen, ready to serve their purpose from the moment of their creation. Though they don’t possess much in the way of standard intellectual prowess, saurus have an intuitive understanding of warfare and combat tactics, able to execute advanced tactical maneuvers that belie their slow-witted demeanor.

> ##### The Rampaging Condition
> All the saurus in this document have abilities that cause them to enter a rampage. Rampaging has the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: <br>
> &#8226;  Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.<br>
> &#8226; The creature must take the Attack action on each of its turns, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see unless there are no creatures it can reach with an attack. <br>
> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>
> &#8226;  The creature can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

The suarus combine the features of dinosaur and man, lumbering across the battlefield clad in iron-hard scales with powerful jaws capable of tearing into even the most heavily armored foes. Beyond their natural armaments, saurus wield massive stone weaponry and shields crafted from the hides of giant jungle beasts. These physical advantages, combined with cold, ruthless discipline and intuitive tactical know-how, make even a single rank-and-file saurus warrior more than a match for the typical soldier of another race.


Though the saurus are created to be disciplined and resolute soldiers, they still possess a bestial savagery in their hearts that harkens back to their primal ancestry. Saurus pushed to their limits in battle will throw off the pretense of restraint and enter a rampage, tearing into the nearest enemies they see, heedless of danger or even their orders. 

### Sacred Spawnings

It is believed that the gods of the ancient lizardmen watch over every saurus spawning, guiding their civilization along the Great Plan laid for the world at the dawn of time. Occasionally, a spawning will result in a batch of saurus bearing distinct colorations and abilities. These are thought to be blessings of the Old Ones used to create specialized warriors capable of aiding the lizardmen in unique ways. Through these blessed saurus, the divine will of the Old Ones is carried out, and The Great Plan is actualized.

### Blessings of the Old Ones
Some saurus warriors are spawned with enhanced abilities attributed to their ancient gods. These saurus bear colorations that signify their specialized abilities and the unique ways they can serve their masters.

#### Blessing of the Beast God

*These lizardmen are marked with elaborate crests containing striking colors and possess an instinctive kinship with other beasts who possess the same primal instincts.*

If the saurus has a controlled mount with the Primal Instinct ability, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the saurus’s turns.

Additionally, while the saurus or the creature it is mounted on is rampaging, the saurus’s attacks deal an additional 9 (2d8) damage on hit.

Finally, If the saurus is rampaging, it may choose not to move on its turn if it is mounted, even if this would prevent it from being able to attack.

#### Blessing of the Blood God

*These hyper-aggressive lizardmen are marked with blood-red scales and infused with a ferocity that drives them to slaughter in their god’s name.*

While the saurus is rampaging, its has advantage on attack rolls and deals additional 11 (2d10) damage on hit.

#### Blessing of the God of Fate

*These lizardmen are marked by the oldest of gods with pure white scales and are said to be destined for greatness as fate itself bends to their will.*

At the start of saurus’s turns, it can choose to be under the effects of the *foresight* spell until the end of its next turn.

Once the saurus uses this feature, it can't use it again until it finishes a long rest.

#### Blessing of the Hunter God

 *These saurus are marked with a brown spotted coloration to help them blend into the wilderness, and they possess superior predatory instincts that allow them to stalk prey through the thickest jungles.*

The Saurus has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage and may do so even if it is only lightly obscured. 

Additionally, the saurus has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight, and dim light doesn't impose disadvantage on these checks. 

Finally, the saurus can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage,  or being grappled or restrained by them.

#### Blessing of the Protector God

*These lizardmen are marked with bony nobs and thick scales of a glittering silver color that deflect ranged attacks.*

While the saurus isn’t rampaging, when a creature 10 or more feet away from it hits it with an attack or deals damage to it with a spell, the damage is halved.

\columnbreak

#### Blessing of the River God

*These aquatic lizardmen are marked with sea-green hues, gills, webbed claws, and crocodilian jaws they can use to drag their foes to a watery grave.* <br>
The saurus has a swim speed of 40 ft. and can breathe underwater.

When the saurus hits a creature with its bite attack, the target is grappled (escape DC equal to 8 + the Saurus’s Strength Modifier + Its Proficiency Bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the saurus can't bite another target.

#### Blessing of the Stoic God

*These saurus are marked with yellow lines down their body that signify their impassive nature and level-headedness during combat.*

The saurus adds +3 to its Wisdom, Charisma, and Intelligence saving throws and has resistance to psychic damage.

Additionally, its Primal Instinct feature is only triggered by it becoming charmed or frightened.

#### Blessing of the Sun God

*These energetic lizardmen are marked with the orange of the setting sun across their scales, and their sun god's power drives them to chase down their prey at alarming speeds.*

The saurus has advantage on intuitive rolls, and its speed is increased by 10 feet. If it would enter a rampage, it may use its reaction to move up to its speed toward any enemy it can see without provoking attacks of opportunity before its rampage begins.

#### Blessing of the Wind God

*These mystical lizardmen are marked with shimmering purple scales and possess primal wards that can sweep away enemy magics.*

The saurus can cast *counterspell* once per day without any components, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability. Its Primal Instinct ability is triggered when it casts the spell this way. (It can't cast the spell while rampaging.)

### Saurus Loot
Because Saurus are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Saurus Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
