## Saurus

Among the lizardmen civilization, the saurus are responsible for waging war and protecting their people. They are created for battle, emerging as fully formed adults from ancient spawning pools maintained by the lizardmen, ready to serve their purpose from the moment of their creation. Though they don’t possess much in the way of standard intellectual prowess, saurus have an intuitive understanding of warfare and combat tactics, able to execute advanced tactical maneuvers that belie their slow-witted demeanor.

> &#8226;  Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.<br>
> &#8226; The creature must take the Attack action on each of its turns, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see unless there are no creatures it can reach with an attack. <br>
> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>
> &#8226;  The creature can’t maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

The suarus combine the features of dinosaur and man, lumbering across the battlefield clad in iron-hard scales with powerful jaws capable of tearing into even the most heavily armored foes. Beyond their natural armaments, saurus wield massive stone weaponry and shields crafted from the hides of giant jungle beasts. These physical advantages, combined with cold, ruthless discipline and intuitive tactical know-how, make even a single rank-and-file saurus warrior more than a match for the typical soldier of another race.


Though the saurus are created to be disciplined and resolute soldiers, they still possess a bestial savagery in their hearts that harkens back to their primal ancestry. Saurus pushed to their limits in battle will throw off the pretense of restraint and enter a rampage, tearing into the nearest enemies they see, heedless of danger or even their orders. 

### Sacred Spawnings

It is believed that the gods of the ancient lizardmen watch over every saurus spawning, guiding their civilization along the Great Plan laid for the world at the dawn of time. Occasionally, a spawning will result in a batch of saurus bearing distinct colorations and abilities. These are thought to be blessings of the Old Ones used to create specialized warriors capable of aiding the lizardmen in unique ways. Through these blessed saurus, the divine will of the Old Ones is carried out, and The Great Plan is actualized.

### Temple Guard
While there are many types of unique saurus spawnings that can arise depending on the needs of the Old Ones, one variant carries a special reverence. Saurus of this spawning are known as the temple guard, and they possess an iron resolve and dedication to duty beyond the rest of their kind. These saurus are made to protect their sacred charges. These charges are most often venerable mage-priests of the lizardmen, but some temple guard may be assigned to protect particularly revered relics and divine location. 

Temple guards don ancient bones and armaments and perform their duties with supernatural discipline. They can stand motionless for centuries at a time, watching for the slightest sign of danger. Should such danger arise, they spring to action without a moment’s hesitation, shielding their charge from harm while ruthlessly striking down any threat. 

Such is their discipline that temple guards can rarely be phased by circumstances that would break the will of most. Even the innate savagery of their kind is kept in check so as to ensure the protection of their charge.

The most elite among the temple guard are referred to as the chamber guardians. Their service is reserved for the most sacred of sites and most venerable of mage-priests. Their guardianship is unsurpassed, for they are never surprised and possess martial capabilities beyond that of any other saurus soldiers.

### Saurus Commanders
Though the saurus have little to no say in the day-to-day governance of the lizardmen, which is left to the skinks, or the grand, long-term plans of their civilization, which is directed by the mage-priests, the saurus are the masters of leading wartime efforts. Saurus have no known maximum lifespan and grow more powerful with age. Those who’ve endured for centuries accrue enough experience to become leaders among their kind and, thus, the principal commanders for the lizardmen as a whole. These battle-worn saurus are referred to as scar veterans. 

The centuries of hard-won wisdom scar veterens have accrued not only makes them more potent combatants but also gives them the skills necessary to direct their kin to maximum effect. While a saurus general leads the battle, he can curb the primal instincts of the beasts and lizardmen under his command. However, should the commander himself succumb to his primal instincts, the rampage of his fellow beasts and lizardmen will be all the more frenzied as they follow his savage example.

The most ancient saurus generals have survived millennia of warfare and come to be known as old bloods, the pinnacle of martial prowess and expertise amongst the lizardmen. Old bloods can control the forces of the lizardmen as though they’re extensions of their own body and execute intricate battle tactics as intuitively as they wield their ancient weapons. To face an old blood is to face a thousand years of martial mastery in the form of a single indomitable warrior.

### Blessings of the Old Ones
Some saurus warriors are spawned with enhanced abilities attributed to their ancient gods. These saurus's bear colorations that signify their specialized abilities and the unique ways they can serve their masters. You can apply one of these blessings to any of the saurus stat blocks described in this document. Doing so increases that saurus’s CR by 1. The saurus who most commonly have these blessings are saurus sacred spawn, scar veterans, and old bloods.

#### Blessing of the Beast God

*These lizardmen are marked with elaborate crests containing striking colors and possess an instinctive kinship with other beasts who possess the same primal instincts.*

If the saurus has a controlled mount with the Primal Instinct ability, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the saurus’s turns.

Additionally, while the saurus or the creature it is mounted on is rampaging, attacks of the saurus and the mount deal an additional 9 (2d8) damage on hit.

Finally, If the saurus is rampaging, it may choose not to move on its turn if it is mounted, even if this would prevent it from being able to attack.

#### Blessing of the Blood God

*These hyper-aggressive lizardmen are marked with blood-red scales and infused with a ferocity that drives them to slaughter in their god’s name.*

While the saurus is rampaging, its has advantage on attack rolls and deals additional 11 (2d10) damage on hit.

#### Blessing of the God of Fate

*These lizardmen are marked by the oldest of gods with pure white scales and are said to be destined for greatness as fate itself bends to their will.*

At the start of saurus’s turns, it can choose to be under the effects of the *foresight* spell until the end of its next turn.

Once the saurus uses this feature, it can't use it again until it finishes a long rest.

#### Blessing of the Hunter God

 *These saurus are marked with a brown spotted coloration to help them blend into the wilderness, and they possess superior predatory instincts that allow them to stalk prey through the thickest jungles.*

The Saurus has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage and may do so even if it is only lightly obscured. 

Additionally, the saurus has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. 

Finally, the saurus can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage,  or being grappled or restrained by them.

#### Blessing of the Protector God

*These lizardmen are marked with bony nobs and thick scales of a glittering silver color that deflect ranged attacks.*

While the saurus isn’t rampaging, when a creature 10 or more feet away from it hits it with an attack or deals damage to it with a spell, the damage is halved.

#### Blessing of the River God

*These aquatic lizardmen are marked with sea-green hues, gills, webbed claws, and crocodilian jaws they can use to drag their foes to a watery grave.* <br>
The saurus has a swim speed of 40 ft. and can breathe underwater.

When the saurus hits a creature with its bite attack, the target is grappled (escape DC equal to 8 + the Saurus’s Strength Modifier + Its Proficiency Bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the saurus can't bite another target.

#### Blessing of the Stoic God

*These saurus are marked with yellow lines down their body that signify their impassive nature and level-headedness during combat.*

The saurus adds +3 to its Wisdom, Charisma, and Intelligence saving throws and has resistance to psychic damage.

Additionally, its Primal Instinct feature is only triggered by it becoming charmed or frightened.

#### Blessing of the Sun God

*These energetic lizardmen are marked with the orange of the setting sun across their scales, and their sun god's power drives them to chase down their prey at alarming speeds.*

The saurus has advantage on intuitive rolls, and its speed is increased by 10 feet. If it would enter a rampage, it may use its reaction to move up to its speed toward any enemy it can see without provoking attacks of opportunity before its rampage begins.

#### Blessing of the Wind God

*These mystical lizardmen are marked with shimmering purple scales and possess primal wards that can sweep away enemy magics.*

The saurus can cast *counterspell* once per day without any components, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability. Its Primal Instinct ability is triggered when it casts the spell this way. (It can't cast the spell while rampaging.)

### Saurus Loot
Because Saurus are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Saurus Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Saurus Tactics
Saurus are direct and aggressive in their combat tactics and will usually fight to the death regardless of how dire their circumstances seem. They usually charge headlong into their foes, though they aren’t stupid about how they approach and won’t stumble into obvious traps or allow themselves to easily be put in a disadvantageous position. Saurus instinctively understand how to flank and outmaneuver foes, and they can usually pick out soft targets that need to be taken down first. 

Saurus are slightly stronger than other creatures at their CR because their Primal Instinct ability provides an exploitable weakness. As a DM, it’s important to communicate to the players when a saurus enters into a rampage what effect this appears to have on it. This way, clever players can use it to their advantage. 

#### Saurus Warriors
&emsp;**Bite.** Use this by default unless there is a commander ordering it not to. Because using bite has a chance to cause the saurus to rampage but also get another bite as a bonus action, the commander may order them to start using this attack if they are below 50 hit points and, therefore, close to rampaging anyway. Saurus will always use this in place of a shield attack if they’re rampaging.

**Maul.** Use this every turn as it is the most powerful attack.

**Shield.** Use this if a commander orders them to not use bites to avoid going into a rampage. Saurus won’t use this attack if they’re rampaging.

#### Saurus Sacred Spawn
These saurus follow mostly the same tactics as normal warriors. If they have blessings that work with the rampage condition, there may be more circumstances in which they use their bite to try and enter a rampage early.

#### Saurus Temple Guard
Temple guard, as their name implies, are designed to be bodyguards. They work especially well with spellcasters or other fragile ranged attackers. 

**Guardian’s Intervention.** Because this reaction reduces more damage if the saurus isn’t engaged in melee combat, temple guards will often stay near their charge rather than try to close in with players, even if they’re taking ranged fire.

**Sacred Duty.** It’s important to note this doesn’t stop Primal Instinct from triggering; it just suppresses the rampage condition while the temple guard is near its charge. Keep the guard close to its charge if you don’t want it running off after the nearest enemy.

#### Saurus Scar Veterens and Old Bloods
While under the control of a saurus commander, other saurus will be much more tactical in how they attack and use their abilities. Saurus commanders have the following abilities they can use to influence the battle:

**Bite.** Because the saurus rolls 2d6 for damage, there is a much higher chance of this attack causing it to enter a rampage. The saurus will avoid using this attack unless it believes entering a rampage for the extra damage from its Primal Command aura will help its forces win the fight.

**Head Cracking Maul.** This is the saurus’s most damaging attack, and it will use it every turn, prioritizing spellcasters whenever it can.

**Puncturing Shield.** This attack is ideal against creatures with low strength and in situations where there aren’t too many enemies able to immediately make counterattacks against the saurus, so the loss of AC is manageable.

**Primal Command.** Because this aura suppresses the rampage condition, saurus within it will use their bite attacks as much as possible to try to score an extra bonus action bite without fear of succumbing to the effects of the rampage. 

**Tail Slam.** The knock-back from this attack makes it a useful escape tool or a way to push enemies apart to give other lizardmen a chance to gain better positioning.
