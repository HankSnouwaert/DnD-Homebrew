## Cold Ones

These large raptors roam far and wide in large, rapacious packs tearing apart any warm-blooded creatures they come across. Cold ones are known for their wild blood lust, vicious weaponry, and propensity for hunting in packs to bring down much larger prey. Their sheer aggression is among their most dangerous traits, for wounded cold ones do not flee but instead, become more recklessly aggressive. Even attempts to pacify or frighten a cold one with magic will simply make it wilder and angrier.

> &#8226;  If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it must use a Dash action to move toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of. <br>

Cold ones are extremely simple-minded, even by dinosaur standards. Though they have an instinctive ability to hunt in packs, their ability to assess complex situations and execute appropriate strategies is severely limited. Most cold ones will pursue prey headless of any danger which presents itself.

Despite their limited intelligence and aggressive natures, cold ones can be successfully broken into mounts at scale. Because their territories range across many climates, they have been adopted for military use by multiple races. However, the lizardmen, who share their primordial jungle homes with the cold ones, were the first to do so. Many of their saurus warriors are spawned with blessings that grant them a natural kinship with wild reptilian beasts and lend them to being natural cavalry fighters atop the vicious cold ones. These mounted warriors make for devastating shock cavalry capable of running down and ripping apart even the hardiest of foes. 



### Horned Ones
These extremely rare raptors are thought to be near-extinct relatives of the cold ones. They are only found deep in the primeval jungles where the lizardmen also make their home. Horned ones don’t roam as far and wide as cold ones and instead guard specific stretches of jungle they regard as their territory. Though horned ones are significantly more intelligent than cold ones, they are extremely protective of their turf and will fight to the death when attacking any intruders. As their name suggests, they are armed with boney horns, which they use to ram prey before finishing the kill with claws and teeth.

Horned ones are prized mounts among the lizardmen. Their rarity, intelligence, and enhanced weaponry means they are ridden by only the most elite saurus soldiers and their generals. In battle, horned one riders are implacable cavalry warriors, bowling down foes without giving an inch of ground.

##### Cold One Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |The players have been charged with venturing into a cold one nest to retrieve eggs.|
|  2  |A wizard has resurrected a pack of long-dead cold ones, which have broken free and now roam his lab. |
|  3  |The players have been tasked with capturing cold ones to use as mounts. However, they soon find themselves in competition with lizardmen hunters.    |
|  4  |A cohort of lizardmen cold one cavalry is moving through the countryside near their jungle home, sacking every minor warmblood settlement they find.|

|  6  | A saurus commander has gained control of a horned one which he now uses as his savage steed to lead a lizardmen crusade against the other warmblooded races.    |

### Cold One Loot
The valuable items looted from cold ones will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cold one.

#### Cold One Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Cold One Loot Table


| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-6  | 1 5gp Item |
|  7-9 | 1d4(2) 5gp Items | 
|  10-22 | 1 10gp Item  |  
|  23+ |  1 20gp Item |  


##### Horned One Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1 5gp Item |
|  8-10 | 1d4(2) 5gp Items | 
|  11-16 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items  |  
|  17-22 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items |  
|  23+ |  1d4(2) 20gp Items |  
 

\columnbreak

#### Example Cold One Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.



##### Example Cold One Item Names
|1d4 | 5gp Item | 10gp Item | 20gp Item | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 <br> (Bone)  |   Cracked Cold One Bone |  Cold One Bone |  Pristine Cold One Bone  | 
| 2 (Flesh)  | Stringy Cold One Meat| Cold One Meat|  Prime Cold One Meat  | 
| 3 <br> (Fluid)  | Clotted Cold One Blood| Cold One Blood |  Pristine Cold One Blood  | 
| 4 <br> (Hide) | Tattered Cold One Hide| Cold One Hide |  Pristine Cold One Hide  |



### Cold One Tactics

Cold ones are hyper-aggressive and have very low intelligence. Outside of making use of their Pack Tactics ability whenever possible, they don’t have any sophisticated combat tactics. They will simply try to gang up on and bring down the weakest prey they can spot. Allow them to fall for most ploys the party attempts, and let the players use their stupidity against them.

When used as mounts, their tactics will reflect that of the rider. However, the optimal strategy will still usually be to run down and gang up on vulnerable targets while hoping the cold one doesn’t rapamge in the process.

#### Horned Ones

This variant should be played more intelligently and not fall for obvious ploys the same way cold ones would. 

**Charge + Pact Tactics.** Whenever possible, horned ones should use their Charge ability to target an enemy who has an ally within 5 feet of it, so they can combine it with their Pact Tactics. If they are mounted, this will be a non-issue.
