## Cold Ones

These large raptors roam far and wide in large, rapacious packs tearing apart any warm-blooded creatures they come across. Cold ones are known for their wild blood lust, vicious weaponry, and propensity for hunting in packs to bring down much larger prey. Their sheer aggression is among their most dangerous traits, for wounded cold ones do not flee but instead, become more recklessly aggressive. Even attempts to pacify or frighten a cold one with magic will simply make it wilder and angrier.

Cold ones are extremely simple-minded, even by dinosaur standards. Though they have an instinctive ability to hunt in packs, their ability to assess complex situations and execute appropriate strategies is severely limited. Most cold ones will pursue prey headless of any danger which presents itself.

Despite their limited intelligence and aggressive natures, cold ones can be successfully broken into mounts at scale. Because their territories range across many climates, they have been adopted for military use by multiple races. However, the lizardmen, who share their primordial jungle homes with the cold ones, were the first to do so. Many of their saurus warriors are spawned with blessings that grant them a natural kinship with wild reptilian beasts and lend them to being natural cavalry fighters atop the vicious cold ones. These mounted warriors make for devastating shock cavalry capable of running down and ripping apart even the hardiest of foes. 

### Horned Ones
These extremely rare raptors are thought to be near-extinct relatives of the cold ones. They are only found deep in the primeval jungles where the lizardmen also make their home. Horned ones don’t roam as far and wide as cold ones and instead guard specific stretches of jungle they regard as their territory. Though horned ones are significantly more intelligent than cold ones, they are extremely protective of their turf and will fight to the death when attacking any intruders. As their name suggests, they are armed with boney horns, which they use to ram prey before finishing the kill with claws and teeth.

Horned ones are prized mounts among the lizardmen. Their rarity, intelligence, and enhanced weaponry means they are ridden by only the most elite saurus soldiers and their generals. In battle, horned one riders are implacable cavalry warriors, bowling down foes without giving an inch of ground.

### Cold One Tactics

Old ones are hyper-aggressive and have very low intelligence. Outside of making use of their Pack Tactics ability whenever possible, they don’t have any sophisticated combat tactics. They will simply try to gang up on and bring down the weakest prey they can spot. Allow them to fall for most ploys the party attempts, and let the players use their stupidity against them.

When used as mounts, their tactics will reflect that of the rider. However, the optimal strategy will still usually be to run down and gang up on vulnerable targets while hoping the cold one doesn’t rapamge in the process.

#### Horned Ones

This variant should be played more intelligently and not fall for obvious ploys the same way cold ones would. 

**Charge + Pact Tactics.** Whenever possible, horned ones should use their Charge ability to target an enemy who has an ally within 5 feet of it, so they can combine it with their Pact Tactics. If they are mounted, this will be a non-issue.
