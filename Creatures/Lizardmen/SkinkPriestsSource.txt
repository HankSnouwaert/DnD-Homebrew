### Skink Priest Tactics

In battle, skinks can serve as the main spell casters or as supporters to more powerful spellcasters. Their traits make them resistant to magic, but they are still vulnerable to weapon attacks. Skink priests need some form of cover, be it foliage or a larger creature, to shield them from these threats. If several skink priests assist a more powerful spellcaster, they should space themselves out. This strategy grants the more powerful caster leading them better control over the battlefield.

#### Skink Lore of Beasts Tactics
Skinks adept in the lore of beasts excel when paired with a skirmishing group of fellow skinks and/or a larger beast, ideally both. Here's how their spells are optimally employed:

**Pass Without Trace.** This spell should be cast preemptively. If a skink enters combat without having cast this spell and there are three or more allies capable of hiding as a bonus action, the skink will still cast it during combat.

**Wild Surge & Aspect of the Beast.** The skink's Wild Heart trait enhances the effects of these spells. They are best cast on the largest beast it's allied with. If a skink priest possesses both spells, it should target the same beast with both. This ensures the additional attack granted by Aspect of the Beast benefits from the damage boost of Wild Surge.

**Call of the Pack.** The skink will cast this spell if it sees an ally within 5 feet of an enemy. The extra action from the spell allows the skink priest to either Dash or Disengage to safety or opt to Hide if the situation demands it.

**Amber Spear.** The skink should use this spell when it can hit 3 targets (or 2 targets with low Dexterity).

#### Skink Lore of Heavens Tactics

These skinks do best when positioned at elevated vantage points, such as atop cliffs, tall trees, or riding on flying beasts. They specialize in countering flying creatures, always prioritizing them with their spells. Here's how their spells are optimally employed:

**Lightning Strike.** This spell is most effective when cast on two or more creatures. If the skink priest has exhausted its major spells, it will resort to using Lightning Strike on single targets, prioritizing creatures with the lowest Dexterity.

**Curse of the Midnight Wind.** Ideally, this should be the skink priest's opening spell, especially if it can affect three or more targets.

**Wind Blast.** This spell is versatile and can be used to push one or more enemies into the effects of an Ice Storm or Comet's Call that the skink has previously cast.

**Ice Storm.** This is best used as the skink's second spell, especially if it can affect three or more targets.

**Comet's Call.** This spell acts as a defensive mechanism. If the skink is trapped in melee combat, it can cast this to potentially deter attackers. By leveraging its Evasion trait and superior Dexterity saving throw, the skink can usually survive the comet's impact, whereas its assailants might suffer harsher effects. However, the skink will still attempt to move out of the impact zone if possible. The skink prioritizes casting this after Curse of the Midnight Wind and Ice Storm.

### Skink Loot
Because skinks are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skink Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
