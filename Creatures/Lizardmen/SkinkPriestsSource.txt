## Skink Priests

Though the mage priests are the highest-ranking members of their society, most of them spend too much time in isolated contemplation to effectively tend to the day-to-day operations of their civilization. This role is left to the skink priests, who serve as administrators and spiritual leaders to the lizardmen.

Additionally, many skink priests are tasked with divining portents from many potential sources, whether they be celestial alignments, patterns in nature, or the murmurings of their mage priest masters. The priests use these portents to steer the course of their ancient civilization.

Though they possess a fraction of a mage priest's power, skink priests are still potent spellcasters, drawing on the power of the celestial heavens they study or the primal energies of their jungle home. When acting in the service of a mage priest, they can even serve as magical conduits for their master's power. They are also charged with operating the divine relics left behind by their gods, allowing them to unleash devastating power beyond their typical capabilities.

Priests who are in training or have failed to fully develop their powers nonetheless have some inate magical capabilities and can still serve as arcane vessels for their masters and, as such, are referred to as conduits.

|  1  | A skink priest has received a vision from the gods demanding the players be captured and ritually sacrificed to satisfy a coming prophecy.|
|  2  |Following the death of a mage priest, its skink priest attendants quickly begin losing their minds, taking control of the lizardmen it once ruled and leading them into a holy war to distract from their loss.    |
|  3  | While searching the abandoned jungle ruins for a lost relic, the players find themselves competing with a skink scout party led by a priest seeking it as well.     |
|  4  |In the absence of mage priests, a group of isolated lizardmen have devolved into savagery. The remaining skinks and their priest leader seek the players' aid in culling their barbarous kin before they wreak havoc.    |

### Skink Priest Tactics

In battle, skinks can serve as the main spell casters or as supporters to more powerful spellcasters. Their traits make them resistant to magic, but they are still vulnerable to weapon attacks. Skink priests need some form of cover, be it foliage or a larger creature, to shield them from these threats. If several skink priests assist a more powerful spellcaster, they should space themselves out. This strategy grants the more powerful caster leading them better control over the battlefield.

#### Skink Lore of Beasts Tactics
Skinks adept in the lore of beasts excel when paired with a skirmishing group of fellow skinks and/or a larger beast, ideally both. Here's how their spells are optimally employed:

**Pass Without Trace.** This spell should be cast preemptively. If a skink enters combat without having cast this spell and there are three or more allies capable of hiding as a bonus action, the skink will still cast it during combat.

**Wild Surge & Aspect of the Beast.** The skink's Wild Heart trait enhances the effects of these spells. They are best cast on the largest beast it's allied with. If a skink priest possesses both spells, it should target the same beast with both. This ensures the additional attack granted by Aspect of the Beast benefits from the damage boost of Wild Surge.

**Call of the Pack.** The skink will cast this spell if it sees an ally within 5 feet of an enemy. The extra action from the spell allows the skink priest to either Dash or Disengage to safety or opt to Hide if the situation demands it.

**Amber Spear.** The skink should use this spell when it can hit 3 targets (or 2 targets with low Dexterity).

#### Skink Lore of Heavens Tactics

These skinks do best when positioned at elevated vantage points, such as atop cliffs, tall trees, or riding on flying beasts. They specialize in countering flying creatures, always prioritizing them with their spells. Here's how their spells are optimally employed:

**Lightning Strike.** This spell is most effective when cast on two or more creatures. If the skink priest has exhausted its major spells, it will resort to using Lightning Strike on single targets, prioritizing creatures with the lowest Dexterity.

**Curse of the Midnight Wind.** Ideally, this should be the skink priest's opening spell, especially if it can affect three or more targets.

**Wind Blast.** This spell is versatile and can be used to push one or more enemies into the effects of an Ice Storm or Comet's Call that the skink has previously cast.

**Ice Storm.** This is best used as the skink's second spell, especially if it can affect three or more targets.

**Comet's Call.** This spell acts as a defensive mechanism. If the skink is trapped in melee combat, it can cast this to potentially deter attackers. By leveraging its Evasion trait and superior Dexterity saving throw, the skink can usually survive the comet's impact, whereas its assailants might suffer harsher effects. However, the skink will still attempt to move out of the impact zone if possible. The skink prioritizes casting this after Curse of the Midnight Wind and Ice Storm.

### Skink Loot
Because skinks are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skink Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. The spear can pass through spaces occupied by creatures and objects of large size or smaller. Each creature the spear moves through, as well as those within the explosion's radius, must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d6 piercing damage; on a successful one, the damage is halved.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the range increases by 20 feet and the damage by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.



#### Aspect of the Beast

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:**  V, S
- **Duration:**  Concentration, Up to 1 hour.
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

Upon touching a willing creature, you imbue it with bestial might. For the duration, the creature manifests a bestial weapon of your choice from the list below. When it takes the Attack action on its turn, it can make an additional attack with the bestial weapon as part of that action. The weapon is treated as a simple weapon with which the creature is proficient. Unless otherwise stated, it uses its Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls made with the weapon.

**Ripping Jaws.** The creature's mouth becomes filled with dagger-like teeth. Its jaws deal 2d8 piercing damage on a hit. If the bite damages a creature, the user gains temporary hit points equal to half the piercing damage dealt, which last until the spell ends.

**Tearing Claws.** The creature's hands transform into blade-like claws. These claws deal 2d6 slashing damage on a hit and count as finesse weapons. The creature can choose to replace any of its melee attacks made with the Attack action with its claws, including any off-hand attacks.

**Ramming Horns.** Gnarled horns grow from the creature's head. The horns deal 2d8 bludgeoning damage on a hit. If the creature moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with a horn attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage, and if the target is Large or smaller, the creature can choose to push it up to 15 feet away.

\columnbreak

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Ranger
___

Unleashing a primal howl, you stir the wild fervor within your allies. You and up to three other creatures you are aware of within range that can hear you are quickened until the start of your next turn. While quickened this way, these creatures gain advantage on attack rolls against any enemy if at least one of their allies is within 5 feet of that enemy and the ally isn't incapacitated.




#### Wild Surge

* It gains a +2 bonus to Wisdom (Perception) checks and Charisma (Intimidation) checks.
* When it hits with a melee weapon attack or unarmed strike, it deals one extra die of its damage.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 4th-level spell slot or higher, the targeted creature gains an additional 5 temporary hit points for each slot level above 3rd.

<br>

> ##### The Quickened Condition
> The following spell references the quickened condition. A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

\pagebreakNum



## Lore of Heavens

#### Comet's Call
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A piece of iron or nickel ore)
- **Duration:**   1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Wizard, Sorcerer
___

You channel the winds of magic to summon a comet from the heavens to the battlefield. You select a point you can see, 300 feet above you within range, causing a blue pulse to flash in the sky. 

At the start of each of your turns, roll a d6. On a roll of 1-3, nothing occurs. On a roll of 4-6, a 5-foot-radius comet materializes at the chosen point and immediately descends. The comet passes through any Large or smaller creatures and objects, exploding in a 30-foot-radius sphere when it hits a solid surface or a Huge or Gargantuan creature. The explosion's effects spread around corners. 

Each creature or object the comet comes in contact with, as well as those within the explosion's area, must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking the comet's full damage on a failed save, and half as much on a success. The comet's base damage is 5d8 fire damage plus 5d8 bludgeoning damage. Each time you roll to see if the comet appears and it doesn't, the fire and bludgeoning damage it deals each increase by 1d8. The spell ends after the comet lands.





***At Higher Levels.*** Casting this spell using a 6th-level spell slot or higher increases either the fire damage or the bludgeoning damage (your choice) by 1d8 for every slot level above 5th.

#### Curse of the Midnight Wind
*3rd-level enchantment*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (Pinch of salt)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Cleric, Warlock 
___

You summon a chilling wind, affecting an area within range that can be up to 40 feet long, 10 feet wide, and 10 feet tall. Up to six creatures of your choice within this area feel their fortune wane. Each targeted creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be cursed by this spell for its duration.

While cursed:
* If the creature rolls an 18 or higher on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw against an effect not caused by this spell, it automatically fails.
* When another creature makes an attack against the cursed target and rolls a 3 or lower on the attack roll, the attacking creature automatically hits.

At the end of its turn, an affected creature can attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending the curse's effect on it on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.


#### Ice Storm (Revised)
*4th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few <br> drops of water)
- **Duration:**  1 Round
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A barrage of rock-hard ice plummets from the sky, forming a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. The area becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn, and any  creature within it has disadvantage on ranged attack rolls.

When the ice storm initially appears or if a creature is inside its area at the end of your next turn, the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d4 bludgeoning damage and 3d4 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, both the bludgeoning and cold damage increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.


#### Lighting Strike

- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of fur and a rod of amber, crystal, or glass)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid
___

You summon a bolt of lightning to strike a point you can see within range. Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can summon an additional lightning bolt for each slot level above 2nd. These bolts can target the same or different points. If a creature is in the area of more than one lightning bolt, it is affected only once.


#### Wind Blast
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A legume seed)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You summon a powerful gust of wind emanating from a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range and blasting out in the direction of your choice. Medium or smaller objects in this area that aren't secured and aren't being worn or carried are pushed up to 15 feet in the chosen direction. Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed in the chosen direction and knocked prone. The wind also disperses gas and vapor and extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in its area.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the wind pushes creatures and objects an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.
