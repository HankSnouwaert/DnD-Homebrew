## Chakatl, The Eternal Warden
*Supreme Bodyguard of The Ancient Mage-Priests*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Armaments, Individual <br>
Among the saurian temple guard, tasked with protecting the venerated sload mage priests who rule over the lizardfolk, only a select few are entrusted with the most crucial duties. These duties involve watching over the oldest and most powerful mage priests, who reside within the ancient City of Stars and hibernate in the great temples of this ancient settlement. The death of such beings, who possess vast knowledge and power, would be an irretrievable loss to the lizardfolk.

It is Chakatl who now takes up the mantle of Eternal Warden, ever watchful for any threat that might befall his sacred charges. This stalwart bodyguard is aware of even the slightest disturbance in the air or the faintest of sounds. In addition to his own extraordinary perception, Chakatl wears the skull of the first temple guard atop his head, its lingering spirit amplifying his senses so that no foe can ambush him. Over the centuries, all assassination attempts on the mage priests under Chakatl’s guardianship have been crushed without effort or hesitation. 

Wielding the massive Star-Stone Mace with precision, Chakatl delivers earth-shattering blows that would reduce a normal human soldier to nothing but a red stain. Should a transgressor possess great power and manage to survive such a devastating blow, they will find all enchantments upon them nullified. Additionally, Chakatl bears a great key hanging about his neck, a artifact of the Temple of the Star City, which grants him the power to slow time itself around his enemies. To this day, none under Chakatl’s protection have ever fallen.

### Chakatl Tactics
Chakatl's primary role is to protect his Sacred Charge and keep them alive. He engages the largest group of enemies to draw attention and control the battlefield.

#### Actions
* **Tossing Bite:** Chakatl uses his Tossing Bite to reposition enemies. He targets melee combatants to move them away from his Sacred Charge or to group enemies together so he can make better use of his Eternal Warden and Key of Eternity traits.
* **Star-Stone Mace:** When striking with his Star-Stone Mace, Chakatl prioritizes enemies that either have the most magic items, that are knocked prone from his Tossing Bite, or that have been slowed by his Key of Eternity.

#### Reactions
* **Intercept:** Chakatl uses Intercept to disrupt as many enemy attacks and spells as possible. He positions himself adjacent to the attacker, ensuring his Eternal Warden trait applies to the creature targeting his Sacred Charge.
* **Warden's Strike:** When an enemy attempts to escape, either by disengaging, teleporting, or using interplanar travel, Chakatl uses Warden's Strike to deny their retreat.
    *  **Use Tossing Bite** to throw them away from his Sacred Charge if the target is a melee combatant with low Strength.
    *  **Otherwise, use his Star-Stone Mace** to deal greater damage and suppress magical items.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
