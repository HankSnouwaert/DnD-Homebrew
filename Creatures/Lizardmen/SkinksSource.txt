## Skinks

While they are the smallest and frailest of the lizardmen, skinks are the glue that holds their society together. The saurus know little other than war and combat, so it falls to the skinks to serve as administrators, artisans, and any other form of skilled labor required by their empire. That is not to say they serve no purpose in war. While skinks are physically weak and skittish compared to the rest of their kind, they are cunning and nimble creatures capable of filling many specialized roles.

Skinks' most common roles in combat are as mobile fighters who either ambush their foes or scamper into battle alongside larger allies. What they lack in brute force, they make up for with cunning tactics and poisonous weapons. These poisons are gathered from deadly jungle animals and used to debilitate foes in guerilla-style hit-and-run attacks. When fighting alongside larger creatures, skinks use these poisonous weapons to cripple their foes and make them easy prey for their deadly allies.

Many skinks are trained as scouts and skirmishers who specialize in stealth and the use of poisonous blowguns. Their foes rarely see them for more than a moment before they disappear into the jungle canopy to prepare another crippling attack. Often times these skink skirmishers are sent ahead of a larger force to sow disorder among their foes before the larger lizardmen force smashes into their vulnerable prey.

One of the more specialized roles some skinks assume is that of beast keepers. These skinks tend to larger reptilian beasts of war and are known as behemoth keepers. The reptilian monsters they tend to must be raised from birth if there is to be any chance of controlling them with any modicum of safety. The skinks form a bond with the beast they rear, which serves them well in combat, turning them into a fighting force greater than the sum of its parts. 

Directing the skinks in day-to-day life as well as in combat are the chieftains. They are bolder than the typical skink and can drive their kind into a much more effective fighting force. A normally furtive and skittish group of skinks led by a chieftain can become a brutal strike force capable of rapidly bringing down foes typically outside their capabilities. The skink chieftains also serve as patrol leaders, heads of scouting parties, and battle coordinators for large lizardmen forces. They ensure battle plans are executed and pesky foes are eliminated as they conduct the war effort of the lizardmen army with brutal, calculating efficiency.

### Skink Loot
Because skinks are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Skink Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Skink Tactics

Skinks generally keep their distance from the enemies, using their superior land, climb, and swim speeds to stay out of melee range. They generally work to debuff foes, and combo well with more powerful creatures who attack head on.

#### Jungle Toxins. 
Skinks rely on this ability for their own defense, as poisoned players will have a harder time hitting them with attacks or spotting them while they’re hidden. As such, they will try to poison as many enemies as possible.

#### Mask of the Jungle. 
This ability is vital for skinks initiating combat as they will never start a fight without the backup of more powerful creatures unless they can do so from an ambush.

#### Skink Cohorts.
These skinks have the fewest options for weaving in and out of combat, and so will rely on poisoning targets from a distance before engaging in melee. They will not close the gap with enemies who aren’t poisoned or in some way disabled.

#### Skink Skirmisher.
Because these skinks have blowguns and the ability to hide every turn using their vanish ability, they will never engage in melee combat unless cornered.

#### Skink Behemoth Keeper.
These skinks are usually found atop the howdas of larger creatures and will always make use of their Beast Bond ability to enhance their mount.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Skink Chieftain.
These skinks lead their kind in battle. They have a few noteworthy abilities:

##### Coordinating Javelin.
Chieftains will use this ability to help other skinks quickly land a second javelin strike against a chosen target, thereby increasing the likelihood of it failing its saving throw against the Jungle Toxins.
##### Stalking Cohort.
This ability allows groups of skinks to focus fire poisoned targets. The skinks can pop out from hiding, launch volleys of ranges attacks, and then disappear again, quickly whittling down poisoned players.
