## Zor-Rokk, The Pale Lizard
*Indomitable Champion of The Lizardmen*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Armament, Individual <br>

In the days when the stars of Heaven align in solemn council, and the fires of distant mountains blaze forth, casting white flames to dance upon the mirror of the sea, there shall arise a Saurian from the sacred pool, alone and peerless, clad in scales of alabaster, towering in stature beyond all kin that came before. His body and mind shall be wrought as if from iron, unbreakable in loyalty and limb, a hero forged by the will of the Old Ones.

And lo, a Priest of the Heavens, beholding his unwavering devotion, and a Priest of the Beasts, marveling at his primal strength, shall come forth to greet this new-made warrior. Both shall bow before his might and proclaim his destiny. By their command, the ancient seals of the armories, hidden deep within the thickest wilderness and guarded by the disciples of the Old Ones, shall be broken. From those shadowed depths shall be drawn a mace of turquoise, its strikes guided by the unerring will of the Old Ones, a weapon to rend the enemies of the divine.

Moreover, it shall be decreed that a shield be forged for the Pale Lizard, worthy of his grandeur. To the Mountains of White Flame shall the priests’ servants journey, where, with toil unyielding, twelve Crox shall labor to hew a mighty slab of stone. Torn from the grasp of the earth, it shall be borne to the mainland, where twelve artificers, skilled in the craft of ages, shall carve a shield of such vastness that none but the great Pale Lizard may wield it in battle.

With these gifts—the mace of turquoise and the shield of stone—the Pale Lizard shall go forth in the name of the Old Ones. Armies shall rise against him, crashing as waves upon unyielding cliffs, yet he shall endure. The mongrels of chaos shall be scattered before his might, their armaments crushed beneath his tread. As it has been planned by the Old Ones, so shall it be.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Implacable.*** Zor-Rokk has advantage on saving throws against being Incapacitated, Stunned, or Paralyzed.
>
> ***Sheltering Shield.*** As long as Zor-Rokk isn’t Incapacitated and there are no hostile creatures within 5 feet of him, he has three-quarters cover. If Zor-Rokk is subjected to an effect that allows him to make a saving throw to take only half damage, he instead takes no damage on a successful save and half damage on a failed one.
>
> ***Shield of Aeons.*** If a creature moves at least 10 feet straight toward Zor-Rokk immediately before making a melee attack, that attack is made with disadvantage. If the attack misses and the creature is within 5 feet of him, it takes 10 (3d6) Bludgeoning damage.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Maul of the Old Ones.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (4d6 + 7) Bludgeoning damage. Zor-Rokk chooses one of the following effects:  
> **Batter.** The target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 20.  
>   *Failure:* The target is pushed up to 15 feet away and knocked Prone.  
>   *Failure by 10+:* The target is pushed 30 feet away and can’t stand up until the end of its next turn.  
> **Crush.** The target must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 20.  
>   *Failure:* The target takes 14 (4d6) Bludgeoning damage.  
>   *Failure by 10+:* The target takes 28 (8d6) Bludgeoning damage.  
> **Concuss.** The target must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 20.  
>   *Failure:* The target is Dazed* and can’t Concentrate until the start of Zor-Rokk’s next turn.  
>   *Failure by 10+:* The target is Stunned while Dazed.
>
> ***Rock.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 7) Bludgeoning damage. If the attack targets a flying creature, it has advantage, and on a hit the target is knocked Prone.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions. 
> Zor-Rokk gains two additional actions in combat: Shield Charge and Earth Break. He also gains Chomping Frenzy while he is at 150 hit points or less. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count (losing ties), separate from Zor-Rokk’s own, if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace any action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Shield Charge (Initiative Count 15).*** Zor-Rokk moves up to 30 feet in a straight line, ignoring difficult terrain and moving through the space of any creature. Each creature whose space he enters must make a *Dexterity or Strength Saving Throw (target’s choice)*: DC 20.  
>   *Failure:* The creature takes 14 (4d6) Bludgeoning damage and is pushed ahead of Zor-Rokk for the rest of his movement.  
>   *Successful Dexterity Save:* The creature takes no damage and is pushed 5 feet aside to the nearest space out of his path.  
>   *Successful Strength Save:* The creature takes half damage, and Zor-Rokk’s movement ends.
>
> ***Earth Break (Initiative Count 10).*** Zor-Rokk moves up to 15 feet in a straight line and slams his maul into the ground, unleashing a wave of destruction in a 15-foot cube originating from him. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each creature in that area must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 20.  
>   *Failure:* The creature takes 14 (4d6) Bludgeoning damage and is knocked Prone.  
>   *Failure by 10+:* The creature is buried under rubble and Restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free it with a DC 20 Strength Check (with advantage if the rescuer has a Burrow speed).
>
> ***Chomping Frenzy (Initiative Count 1; only while at 150 hit points or less).*** Zor-Rokk makes a bite attack against each creature within 5 feet of him. *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (4d6 + 7) Piercing damage, and the target suffers a rending Wound. While Wounded, the target has disadvantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, checks, and attack rolls, and its Speed is halved. The Wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) Check, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if the target regains 15 or more hit points. If the target already has a rending Wound, it instead takes 28 (8d6) additional Piercing damage.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Zor-Rokk is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

### Epic Battle: Bastion of The Old Ones

If you wish to make Zor-Rokk into an even greater threat for late-game adventurers, you may give him the Resilient trait described below. This increases his Challenge Rating to 18.

***Resilient.***  Zor-Rokk has resistance to all damage from attacks.

Whenever a creature has advantage on an attack roll against Zor-Rokk, it can choose to roll only one die instead of two as it aims for his weak point. If the attack hits, it ignores Zor-Rokk’s resistances. The attack still counts as having advantage for the purpose of abilities such as a rogue’s Sneak Attack.

If any damage would reduce Zor-Rokk to 0 hit points and did not target his weak point, he is reduced to 1 hit point instead. Zor-Rokk only dies if he is reduced to 0 hit points from damage dealt to his weak spot.

> 
> *The beast crashed through the thicket, hurlin’ toward us with a slab o’ stone big as a barn door. A great white lizard, standin’ on two legs, drove it forward with one arm near thick as a man’s chest. The two lads in front o’ me barely had time to clutch their halberds afore that slab smashed into ‘em. Blood and bone painted the stone red. Our wizard, old Erich, was quick to act, mutterin’ his incantations, flames dancin’ ‘cross his fingers like he’d done with all the other mongrels we’d faced. But that thing swung a mace, a brutal thing bigger’n any I’d ever seen, and cracked him ‘cross the head. The poor fool’s head near split, his eyes rollin’ every which way as he stumbled back, clingin’ to life by a thread.*
>
> *The Captain, bold as brass, was a few paces off, atop his warhorse. He hefted his lance and spurred his steed to a full gallop, roarin’ a battle cry that’d make an orc quake. But that cold blood-thing blinked once, calm as a drill sergeant on parade, and turned its slab-shield to meet him. The Captain, all gleam and glory in his knightly plate, crashed into it like an egg toss against a wall. His horse screamed, legs snappin’ like dry twigs, and the man himself twisted every which way, armor bucklin’ under the force, left lookin’ like a piece of crumbled parchment. All this time, that white-scaled hide was still pristine, with not a drop of gore stainin’ it.*
>
> *I didn’t see what came next. My legs decided they’d had enough o’ that slaughter. They carried me far from that cursed place, heart poundin’ like a drum. Last I heard was a sound like a felled oak crashin’ to the ground, and that poor beast’s wailin’ cut short. And that’s why I’ll never step foot in that forsaken wilderness again.*

### Zor-Rokk Tactics
Zor-Rokk is a melee-focused fighter able strike multiple enemies at once, applying debilitating conditions to control the battlefield. His tactics prioritize positioning, targeting vulnerable enemies, and maximizing the impact of his monstrous actions.

**Standard Turn.**
Zor-Rokk uses his turn to position himself optimally for his Shield Charge monstrous action when possible, while still prioritizing attacks against nearby targets. He prefers to target enemies already afflicted by debilitating conditions he has imposed (e.g., Rending Wounds or Restrained), especially if he has advantage against them. However, he will not forgo an attack just to set up a Shield Charge.

When attacking, Zor-Rokk chooses one of the following additional effects based on the situation:

**Batter:** Used to push a low-Strength target into position for a Shield Charge, aligning it with other enemies.

**Crush:** Applied when the target is already in a favorable position, particularly against opponents with low Strength.

**Concuss:** Employed to prevent skirmishers or ranged attackers from escaping, or to disrupt spellcasters maintaining concentration.

#### Monstrous Actions
**Shield Charge:** Zor-Rokk prioritizes hitting as many targets as possible, focusing on ranged fighters. He avoids targeting creatures with high Strength saving throws. If unable to reach ranged targets, he moves toward them to close the distance.

**Earth Break:** Used against the largest group of enemies within range to maximize impact. This ability also prevents enemies from weaving in and out of combat.

**Chomping Frenzy:** Activated when Zor-Rokk’s hit points drop to 100 or below. He targets as many enemies as possible, inflicting Rending Wounds to debilitate them. He uses his other monstrous actions to pursue and finish off wounded enemies attempting to flee.

### Zor-Rokk Loot

Because saurian are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from Zor-Rokk are the remains of the equipment he was using or valuables he was carrying. Most dropped valuables can be found using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** check. 

As an alternative to making any checks, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Zor-Rokk Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
