## Saurian Astrolyph Bearers
*Lizardmen Bearing Artifacts Radiating Arcane Energy*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle; **Treasure:** Arcane <br>
The lizardfolk known as saurians are said to follow a grand cosmic plan laid out by ancient beings who reshaped the world in ages past. Their devotion to these ancients stems not from faith but from an instinct as innate as their need to eat. This intuitive reverence is so profound that when a saurian encounters relics of their bygone gods, a surge of deep devotion drives them to perform strange actions or even operate devices of remarkable complexity through sheer intuition.

No artifact exemplifies this connection more than the astrolyph, a peculiar disc carved from meteoric rock and adorned with the symbols of the old ones, etched in rings across its surface. Neither the saurians nor the servants of these ancient beings fully understand the true purpose of these forgotten discs. Yet, when an astrolyph is discovered by a group of saurians, it becomes immediately clear—without deliberation—that one among them is destined to bear the sacred object and serve as its protector. Often, this responsibility is preordained, with the chosen saurian already marked for the role before the astrolyph is even found.

Though its ultimate function remains a mystery, the saurians carry these discs on ornate golden rods, hoisting them aloft like banners of war. Through these symbols, they harness the light of the heavens, channeling it into radiant beams that rain down upon the earth. Saurians bathed in this luminescence find their wounds healed and gain the resilience to withstand devastating attacks. Conversely, those who oppose the will of the old gods find their flesh seared by the astrolyph’s radiance, their defenses weakened and vulnerable to the ripping jaws and blades of the lizardfolk.

The strength of these rays grows the longer the bearer channels the cosmic power of the heavens. This power can be further amplified through rituals, as other spellcasters lend their incantations to the effort. At its peak, the astrolyph’s brilliance can envelop a battlefield in pale blue light, purging foes with its searing radiance. While the astrolyph is a potent weapon and ward, its capabilities extend far beyond what is understood. Many structures and contraptions from the old ones’ golden age contain slots designed to perfectly hold these mysterious discs. On the rare occasions when an astrolyph is united with such machinery, the grand powers of the ancient beings are unlocked—for better or worse.

### Saurian Astrolyph Bearer Tactics
The saurian astrolyph bearer supports allied saurian fighters from the backline, using its Celestial Light to envelop a large group of enemies and allies. Allies should gather within the light’s area to gain its benefits. Once enemies are immobilized, the astrolyph bearer advances into the light to recover hit points and engage in melee combat. It reserves its bite attack for when it enters a Rampage.

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
