## World Shaper Engines
*Arcane Terraforming Monuments*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Arcane <br>

There are places in the world that have remained unchanged since before the first primates or villages of mankind sprang into existence. Verdant jungles, teeming with archaic, scale-covered behemoths, trample through dense undergrowth filled with flora and fauna found nowhere else. These cradles of life are heedless of slowly changing weather over millennia or the gradual drifting of continents, remaining warm and wet even as surrounding lands plunged into ice ages or shriveled into barren deserts. The steadfast stability of these ancient jungles results from recondite machines known as World Shaper Engines, which sit at the heart of these landscapes.

These massive monuments, crafted from neither metal nor stone, take the form of pyramid-shaped structures that emit a soft hum as their parts shift in strange rhythmic unity, releasing blue sparks. At the top, rotating rings float around a large glowing sphere that hovers above the structure like a celestial body. These devices were created by elder beings to reshape the world in accordance with their race’s grand design. Embedded in the earth’s crust, the machines harvest ley lines of magic that run through the world, unleashing waves of energy that split the sky and shatter the earth, brutally sculpting the environment around them. This powerful terraforming can transform the most desolate landscapes into jungles brimming with life in mere days.

As decades pass, the creators of these altars vanish, leaving their great inventions behind. Without further guidance, the World Shaper Engines continue to maintain their habitats for untold epochs. Many younger races have greedily attempted to poach and plunder the rare flora and fauna that cling to existence around the Engines. When these Engines detect disruptions to their ecosystems’ balance, they take action to correct the disturbance. They can conjure deadly storms and earthquakes from miles away, sweeping away entire encampments of foreign invaders as though they were mere piles of sand.

If such measures fail to deter foolhardy profiteers, the Engines also profoundly affect the local inhabitants they foster, infusing them with near-limitless vitalizing energies. Beasts become saturated with unmatched ferocity, able to heal from the most grievous wounds inflicted upon them. Meanwhile, vines and branches grow and flow like serpents, tangling and pinning outlanders as claws and teeth bring an end to their meddling.


However, there are tales of mighty Engines that do not merely remain stationary to defend their territories. Stories speak of machines that suffer great damage and repair themselves improperly, causing their influence to grow unchecked. Beasts proliferate uncontrollably, spilling into neighboring lands and wreaking untold desolation. On rare occasions, the ancient lizardfolk, who worship the original creators of the Engines, can discern how to command them.

It is said that a priest with the highest affinity for magic may recite incantations left by the old ones in a grand ritual, causing the Engine to uproot itself and drift weightlessly into the air. It soars high in the heavens, only to return over the horizon as a blazing light and crash with thunderous impact. The devoted lizardfolk march forward, following the sight of their fallen star, while in the distance, the Engine embeds itself in a newly formed impact zone, preparing to unleash a torrent of growth to overtake the land in the name of the old ones.

### World Shaper Engine Encounters

* **Use Verdant Beam** against a target standing on difficult terrain created by the engine, provided the engine is not engaged in melee combat.
 
\columnbreak

<br>

* **Use Upheaval (Tempest)** to hit as many targets as possible and force them into unfavorable positions, such as difficult terrain.
* **Use Upheaval (Tremor)** to target groups of enemies, covering as much ground as possible with difficult terrain to generate Fury.

#### Bonus Actions
**Use Primordial Infusion** to keep the target with the most Fury alive.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Fixed.*** The engine can’t be moved or teleported.
>
> ***Verdant Landscape.*** Any allied creature ignores difficult terrain created by the engine and, if it ends its turn in vegetation created by the engine, it gains a level of Fury*. This has no effect on Undead or Constructs.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The engine makes two attacks, then may use its Upheaval.
>
> ***Lightning Strike.*** *Melee or Ranged Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft. range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) Lightning damage or 27 (6d8) Lightning damage if the target is flying.
>
> ***Verdant Beam.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) Radiant damage. If the target is standing on vegetation created by the engine, it is restrained by vines until the vines are destroyed (Escape DC 16 Strength saving throw; AC 18; 15 HP; immune to Poison and Psychic damage).
>
> ***Upheaval (5/Day).*** The engine unleashes elemental devastation, choosing one of the following effects at random by rolling a d6:
>
> **1–3 Tempest.** The engine creates a 15-foot-radius, 90-foot-high cylinder of storming energy centered on a point within 150 feet. This tempest lasts for 1 minute or until the engine dies. It spreads around corners and seeps through openings. When the engine uses this ability, it chooses a direction. When the tempest first appears, and at the start of each of the engine’s turns thereafter, it moves 15 feet in that direction. 
> 
> Any ground the tempest passes over becomes covered in thick vegetation for 1 minute, turning it into difficult terrain.
> 
> Any creature that has one or more tempests pass through its space, or that ends its turn in the area of one or more tempests, must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 16.
> 
> *Failure:*  The creature takes 21 (6d6) Lightning damage and is knocked Prone.
>
> *Success:* The creature takes half damage.
>
> **4–6 Tremor.** The engine causes the ground to quake in a 20-foot-radius area centered on a point between 30 and 150 feet from it. At the start of the engine’s next turn, the ground in that area erupts and becomes covered in thick vegetation for 1 minute, turning it into difficult terrain. 
> 
> Any creature standing in the area when it erupts must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 16.
>
> *Failure:* The creature takes 36 (6d8) Thunder damage and is knocked Prone.
> 
> *Success:* The creature takes half damage.
>
> ***Terraforming Spellcasting.*** The engine can cast the following spells, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The casting time of each spell is 10 minutes, and the range is 1 mile. <br> **1/Day Each:** *Control Weather*, *Earthquake*, *Storm of Vengeance*
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Primordial Infusion.*** A wave of healing energy surges from the engine, restoring up to 30 hit points to its allies. The engine chooses up to four creatures other than itself within 60 feet and divides the healing among them. Each creature healed this way also gains one level of Fury*.
