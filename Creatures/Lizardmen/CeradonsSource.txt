# Howdah
Howdah armored fort  Mount to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures in them.. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these Howdah types in your games. They can be applied to Howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own Howdahs. The rules here can be applied to most Howdah piloted by a Ports strapped to a  Creatures back. 

## Howdah Rules
Howdah  Are generally small structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger  war beast of some kind.). Throughout this document, The creature with the Howdah attach to it will be referred to as the steed, Creatures within a Howdah are referred to as passengers. 
Howdah are items come with the following additional rules considerations:

### Chariot Saving Throws
Howdah equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength and Dexterity Saves
If a Howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, the steed must make a saving throw against the effect. Any steed being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steed succeed on the save, the Howdah passes the save, as those steed manage to hold the Howdah steady.

#### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, Howdah are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, Howdah can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The Howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it attached to a steed.

### Opportunity Attacks
When a steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the Howdah itself, passengers can't provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the Howdah.

### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures within a Howdah count as being within 5 feet of each other.

### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah until the start of its next turn, and any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted. Each passenger already inside the Howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.

### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage Equal to a role of 3 of the creatures Largest hit dice.

### Teleporting.
If the steed is teleported, the howdah is teleported with it. passenger may choose to teleport with the steed.

### Falling Howdahs
When a steed falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all passengers take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position.

### Repairing Howdahs
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

## Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these Howdah have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A Howdah's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a vehicle's hit points reach 0, howdah is destroyed and is irreparably damaged. When the howdah is destroyed, passengers that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the steed.

### Damage Threshold
Most Howdah possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A Howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the Howdah takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the Howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the Howdah's hit points.

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the Howdah comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the Howdah.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

###  Steed size
 This is the size is required for the creature to carry the Howdah and be it's steed.  If a creature ever becomes too small  To carry the Howdah, it Detaches from the steed and  Is treated as if the creature had been knocked prone.
### Howdah DC 
Whenever the Howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.
### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.

###Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the Howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

### Siege Weapons
A Howdah may have built in Siege Weapon. These Siege Weapon are built into the Howdah and share it's Hit Points, AC, Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the Howdah is destroy, the Siege Weapon can only be operator by passengers in the Howdah, and passengers can't provokes attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the Howdah while operatoring the weapon. The weapons can't be used if the Howdah not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.
