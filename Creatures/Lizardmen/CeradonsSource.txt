## Ceradons
Ceradons are imposing primeval beasts that roam the dense jungles inhabited by the lizardmen. These massive creatures have played a vital role in the history of the lizardmen, serving as powerful weapons of war. Their sheer size and strength make them formidable opponents on the battlefield, and their natural aggression makes them a fearsome sight to behold.

Ceradons are massive quadrupeds, covered in thick, leathery hide. They sport enormous bony plates along their backs, which provide natural armor and are often adorned with warpaint or other dedications to the lizardmen gods. Their most distinctive features are their large, downward-curving horns, capable of impaling and lifting even the largest foes. 

Ceradons are omnivores and opportunistic feeders, feasting on vegetation and small prey alike. However, they are also territorial and highly aggressive. They seldom retreat, often choosing to stand their ground and face foes head-on. Their primary mode of attack is charging, using their massive bulk to trample enemies or impale them with their horns. Their armored crests can deflect incoming attacks, making them challenging to land a counterattack against.

The lizardmen have long utilized ceradons in warfare. Skink crews equip these massive creatures with war howdahs, turning them into mobile fortresses. These howdahs often come equipped with giant blowpipes and ballistae that fire poisoned-tipped bolts, allowing the skinks to rain death upon their enemies from a relatively safe position. Occasionally, a howdah may be equipped with an engine of the gods, an ancient relic with arcane properties that skinks can channel to unleash devastating effects on the battlefield.

As ceradons age, they grow even larger and more powerful. The ancient ceradons are the most revered among their kind, their once fiery temper cooling with age. This makes them easier for skink crews to handle, and they are less prone to rampaging uncontrollably. Ancient ceradons are often equipped with the most elite and powerful howdahs, reserved for only the most critical battles.

### The Thunderous One

This legendary ancient ceradon is said to be an avatar of the lizardmen storm god. It is a sacred beast, taller and more formidable than even its other ancient kin, and its presence is said to be an omen of great battles to come. Its scales are the color of a stormy sky, and its eyes crackle with the energy of a tempest. Unlike other ancient ceradons, the Thunderous One's temper has not cooled with age; instead, it rages like a storm, manifesting in thunderous effects that send shockwaves through enemy ranks.

In battle, the Thunderous One's steps echo with the sound of thunder, and its roars flash with claps of lightning. Those who incur its wrath not only face its primeval natural weapons but the divine lightning of its god. Bolts of this lightning rain down on the Thunderous One's foes and electrify those it tramples underfoot. 

\columnbreak

And should it enter a rampage, the Thunderous One's primal roar is said to be powerful to shatter armies and scatter dozens of foes before it. 

The howdahs mounted on the Thunderous One are the most powerful and sacred among the lizardmen, often adorned with religious icons and potent relics. They carry elite skink crews, who wield powerful weapons blessed by the lizardmen priests. These skinks, though humbled by their proximity to such a mighty beast, are the only ones with the experience and knowledge to guide the Thunderous One in battle.

In the heat of war, the Thunderous One becomes a force of nature, bringing the wrath of the storm god upon the enemies of the lizardmen. Its mere presence on the battlefield is a testament to the power of the lizardmen's gods and a sign that the storm god's will is manifesting through the actions of the lizardmen and their mighty ally, the Thunderous One.

## Lizardmen Howdahs

When lizardmen deploy their most titanic reptilian jungle monsters in combat, they are sometimes equipped with mighty war howdahs crewed by smaller lizardmen such as skinks. These howahs are wooden structures that allow an entire lizardman crew to ride atop a mighty steed. The structure provides cover for the crew and can be equppied with siege weapons and even an arcane Engine of the Gods which provides the lizardmen with magical aid. Most lizardmen monsters are far too wild to allow such structures on their back, so those that can be equipped this way are prized by the lizardmen.

Rules for howdahs and the siege weapons they can be equipped with are found at the end of the document.

### Lizardmen Howdah Upgrades

Large howdahs and huge howdahs can be given any of the following upgrades. Each upgrade increases the howdahs effective CR by 1 unless its states otherwise.


#### Sacred Howdah
*The howdah is not only an instrument of war but a small shrine complete with relics and offerings dedicated to the Old Ones to curry their favor.*

The howdah counts as a magic object, and the three-quarters cover granted by the howdah gives a +5 bonus to all saving throws from effects outside the howdah, not just Dexterity saves. If a creature in the howdah is subjected to an effect from outside that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half damage if it fails.

#### Poison Ballista 

*The howdah is equipped with a ballista whose bolts are tipped with deadly jungle toxins.*

The howdah is equipped with the poison ballista siege weapon.
___
> ## Poison Ballista 
> *Medium siege weapon*
>___
> - **Weapon DC** 15
> - **Armor Class** 15 
> - **Hit Points** 60 (damage threshold: 5)
>___
> - **Damage Immunities** poison, psychic
> - **Ammo** Poison Bolt (1 round, 100g)
> - **Challenge** 1 (200 XP)
> ___
>
> ### Functions
>
> ***Load.*** The weapon is loaded with a Poison Bolt. This must be done before it is prepped.
>
> ***Prep.*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done while it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The ballista fires a bolt that flies in a straight line up to 480 feet in the direction of the user's choice before falling to the ground. If the bolt would strike a target, that target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if the bolt has flown 120 feet or more. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or destroyed, the bolt keeps flying and deals 11 (2d10) less damage if it hits another target. Otherwise, the bolt's flight ends at the target's location. 

\columnbreak

#### Giant Blowpipe  
*The howdah is equipped with a giant blowpipe capable of firing a hail of poison-tipped darts.*

The howdah is equipped with the giant blowpipe siege weapon.

Each creature in a 5-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (5d4) piercing damage, is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, and makes the saving throw at the end of its turn against the toxins with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage, is still inflicted with Jungle Toxins, but does not have disadvantage on the saving throw at the end of its turn against the toxins.

> ##### Jungle Toxins
> At the end of the turn, each creature hit by one or more weapons that inflict Jungle Toxins must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that has been hit by two or more attacks from weapons with Jungle Toxins this turn makes the saving throw with disadvantage. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success or taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failure.

#### Engine of the Gods 
*The howdah is equipped with a sacred relic of the Old Ones capable of unleashing a variety of magical effects by those familiar with its usage.*

A howdah is equipped with an Engine of the Gods, which causes the howdah to be treated as a magical object. The engine has 3 charges by default and can possess up to 3 of the abilities listed below. Riders with the howdah who have proficiency in Religion and a Wisdom and Intelligence of 14 or higher can use their action to expend 1 charge to activate one of the engine's abilities. The engine regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

The Engine of the Gods increases the CR of the Howdah by 4 rather than 1.

##### Burning Alignment 
*As the engine comes into alignment, magical power is unleashed to scour the enemy.*

A vertical column of divine fire, 10 feet in radius and 100 feet high, descends at a point within 300 feet of the howdah of the user's choice. It then moves 30 feet horizontally in a straight line in the direction of the user's choice before dissipating. Each target the column passes through must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful save.  

##### Portent of Warding
*Mysterious power pours from the engine, protecting nearby allies.*

When activating this ability, the rider chooses any number of creatures, and an aura of eldritch warding radiates from the howdah in a 30-foot radius for one minute. Each chosen creature gains resistance to damage from spells while within the aura.

\columnbreak

##### Arcane Configuration
*The engine siphons the winds of magic to aid in casting spells of specific energy.*

When activating this ability, the rider chooses a damage type and any number of creatures within 30 feet. The rider and all the chosen creatures then become empowered until the start of the rider's next turn. The next time an empowered creature casts a spell dealing the chosen damage type, it rolls three additional damage dice. The rider activating this ability can also cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action on the same turn.

##### Time Slows
*The engine bends the flow of time.*

Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 300 feet of the howdah must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be affected by the *slow* spell until the howdah is destroyed. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If it fails the repeat saving throw by 5 or more (DC 12), it is stunned until the effect ends.



##### Healing Light
*The engine releases a burst of light that heals battle-weary allies.*

When activating this ability, the rider chooses any number of creatures within 30 feet. Each chosen creature regains 18 (4d8) hit points.

##### Sacred Summon
*The engine calls to the heavens to summon a champion.*

A saurus sacred spawn appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the howdah of the rider's choice and remains until it or the howdah is reduced to 0 hit points or 10 minutes have passed. The saurus shares the initiative count of the rider who used the ability, and it takes its turn immediately after. The saurus is an ally to the rider and its companions.

### Blessings of the Old Ones

Some lizardmen and dinosaurs are created with enhanced abilities attributed to their ancient gods. These creatures bear colorations that signify their specialized abilities and the unique ways they can serve their masters. You can apply one of these blessings to any of the creature stat blocks described in this document. Doing so increases that creature’s CR by 1. 



#### Blessing of the Blood God

While the creature is rampaging, its has advantage on attack rolls and deals additional 11 (2d10) damage on hit.

#### Blessing of the God of Fate

*These lizardmen are marked by the oldest of gods with pure white scales and are said to be destined for greatness as fate itself bends to their will.*

At the start of creature’s turns, it can choose to be under the effects of the *foresight* spell until the end of its next turn.

Once the creature uses this feature, it can't use it again until it finishes a long rest.

#### Blessing of the Hunter God

 *These lizardmen are marked with a brown spotted coloration to help them blend into the wilderness, and they possess superior predatory instincts that allow them to stalk prey through the thickest jungles.*

The creature has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide using foliage and may do so even if it is only lightly obscured. 

Additionally, the creature has advantage on Wisdom (Perception), Wisdom (Survival) checks and can make them as a bonus action. 

Finally, the creature can move through plants without being slowed, taking damage, or being grappled or restrained by them.

#### Blessing of the Protector God

*These lizardmen are marked with bony nobs and thick scales of a glittering silver color that deflect ranged attacks.*

While the creature isn’t rampaging, when a creature 10 or more feet away from it hits it with an attack or deals damage to it with a spell, the damage is halved.

#### Blessing of the River God

*These aquatic lizardmen are marked with sea-green hues, gills, webbed claws, and crocodilian jaws they can use to drag their foes to a watery grave.* <br>
The creature has a swim speed of 40 ft. and can breathe underwater. If the creature already has a swim speed, it is increased by 20 feet.

When the creature hits a creature with its bite attack, the target is grappled (escape DC equal to 8 + the creature’s Strength Modifier + Its Proficiency Bonus). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the creature can't bite another target.

#### Blessing of the Stoic God

*These lizardmen are marked with yellow lines down their body that signify their impassive nature and level-headedness during combat.*

The creature adds +3 to its Wisdom, Charisma, and Intelligence saving throws and has resistance to psychic damage.

Additionally, its Primal Instinct feature is only triggered by it becoming charmed or frightened.

#### Blessing of the Sun God

*These energetic lizardmen are marked with the orange of the setting sun across their scales, and their sun god's power drives them to chase down their prey at alarming speeds.*

#### Blessing of the Wind God

*These mystical lizardmen are marked with shimmering purple scales and possess primal wards that can sweep away enemy magics.*

The creature can cast *counterspell* once per day without any components, using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability. Its Primal Instinct ability is triggered when it casts the spell this way. (It can't cast the spell while rampaging.)

### Ceradon Tactics

Ceradons are territorial, highly aggressive, and omnivorous creatures. While they don't actively hunt prey, they will readily attack anything within charging distance. In battle, a ceradon is resolute and acts primarily on instinct. It focuses on adversaries it perceives as the greatest threat, often choosing targets dealing significant damage or those of considerable size. However, it lacks the intelligence to realize the potential benefits of trampling multiple targets for increased damage output.

If a ceradon starts an encounter already in melee combat, it will retreat, even if doing so exposes itself to opportunity attacks. To defend against such attacks, it employs its Armoured Crest reaction. Following the retreat, it starts charging foes with its Trample action. The ceradon will follow this up with its Gore attack. While it can't gore a target right beneath it, it can trample over a target before circling back to Gore, often doing so with an advantage. Once an opponent is impaled on its horns, the ceradon shifts focus to trampling nearby threats. If it pins another creature under its feet, it will continue its stomp attacks while standing atop the pinned foe.

#### Ceradons With Howdahs

Ceradons equipped with a howdah can display tactical battle acumen under their rider's guidance. They frequently trample through dense clusters of enemies. Even if their Gore attack misses, if the ceradon pins two or more creatures beneath it, it remains stationary, concentrating on crushing them. 

The Armoured Crest reaction is used strategically, saved for countering potent spell attacks or deflecting high damage strikes, such as a rogue's sneak attack.

##### Ceradon Howdah Weapons 

Skinks usually man the ceradon's howdah. They employ long-range poison weapons integrated into the howdah to target enemies beyond the ceradon's reach, especially when the ceradon is stationary because it's pinning victims or it's pursuing elusive targets.

\columnbreak



#### The Thunderous One 

**Thunderous Wrath:** When the Thunderous One utilizes this ability, it repels adversaries not restrained by its feet or impaled on its horns, creating distance between it and its next target for an effective charge and Gore attack.

##### Thunderous One Legendary Actions

The Thunderous One utilizes its legendary actions in the following ways:

**Storm God's Judgement:** This legendary action is reserved for use against a creature impaled on the ceradon's horns or trapped beneath its feet. The Thunderous One instinctively employs this legendary action in this way, even without external guidance.

**Trample:** If there are no eligible targets for Storm God's Judgement, the Thunderous One defaults to this action. When under the guidance of more intelligent beings, it prefers to use this ability if it can potentially overrun more adversaries than those already pinned beneath it.

**Tenacious Will:** This action is invoked solely when its stomping and goring abilities are hindered or interrupted.


#### Engine of the Gods 

When operating a howdah equipped with an Engine of the Gods, understanding the sequence of how abilities should be used is crucial. Here's the recommended priority order:

1. Portent of Warding
2. Sacred Summon
3. Time Slows
4. Arcane Configuration
5. Burning Alignment
6. Healing Light

### Ceradon Loot
The valuable items looted from Ceradon will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a Ceradon. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Ceradon Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

#  Siege Weapons
These weapons have been engineered for large-scale warfare against enemy armies and settlements. What sets them apart from other weapons is their size and the number of creatures required to operate them effectively (generally more than two). These weapons range from highly sophisticated cannons and rocket launchers to crude catapults and giant slingshots. Regardless of their form, they are all large enough that moving them is a slow process and labor-intensive enough to use that they require a team of creatures to operate them effectively.

## Repairing Weapons
If a weapon has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the required tools. If the check succeeds, the weapon regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + the creature's proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the weapon does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

\columnbreak

## Siege Weapon Attributes
In addition to the common attributes of size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity, these weapons have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A weapon has hit points that can be restored through repairs. When its hit points reach 0, the weapon becomes inoperative and irreparably damaged. 

Many weapons have a damage threshold. Any source of damage less than this threshold only inflicts superficial damage and doesn't lower the weapon's hit points.

### Weapon DC 
The weapon's DC is used whenever a creature makes a check to fix mishaps, when a creature is repairing the weapon, or the weapon forces a creature to make a saving throw.

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies equipped with fully functioning siege weapons, the encounter's challenge rating (CR) should be calculated as if the weapon is an additional creature with its own CR.

\pagebreakNum



### Ammo / Fuel
Weapons may require ammunition, such as bullets, or fuel, such as flammable chemicals, to make attacks. This part of the stat block includes the cost of the ammo and the number of charges it has, which represents the number of times the weapon can be used before it needs to be reloaded.

### Functions
By default, siege weapons have three different functions, which can each be activated as an action by its operators: Prep, Load, and Fire. Each function can only be performed once per round unless it states otherwise. Creatures within reach of a creature performing one of these functions can make opportunity attacks against them.

#### Prep
Siege weapons need to be prepped in different ways between being fired. This preparation could be cranking a ballista or cleaning the barrel of a cannon. Many siege weapons have multiple Prep functions that must be performed before they can be used again. In these cases, the different Prep actions can be done by different creatures within the same round. Unless stated otherwise, all the Prep functions must be completed before the weapon can be loaded.

\columnbreak

#### Load
This function is used to reload the weapon's ammunition up to its full capacity. It requires the creature loading it to have immediate access to the weapon's ammunition. If a creature doing the loading is hit by an opportunity it provoked by doing this, it drops the ammo and wastes its action.

#### Fire
This function is used to aim and fire the weapon at a target chosen by the creature performing the function.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits of the weapon has that don't require actions to utilize.

### Mishaps table
Some weapons can suffer a malfunction when certain functions are used. When such an event occurs, it will suffer a mishap and need to roll on its Mishap Table to determine what adverse effect it suffers. 

A creature can attempt to resolve a mishap by using its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap. The creature making the check can be any member of the weapons team or anyone else within reach of the weapon. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a Repair Check Type cannot be repaired.

# Howdahs
War howdahs are small armored structured mounted to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use different types of howdahs in your games. They can be applied to howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own howdahs. 

## Howdah Rules
Howdahs are generally structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger war beast of some kind. The creatures within the howdah are referred to as riders, and the creature the howdah is mounted upon is referred to as its steed. If one of the riders is controlling the steed, that creature is the pilot. Howdah riders and steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a howdah or its steed, the howdah and its steed are moved together.

* **Controlled & Independant Steeds.** The howdah's steed can be a controlled or independent mount as described in the player's handbook. If it is controlled, there must be a pilot who is controlling it.



\columnbreak

* **Entering & Exiting Howdahs.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah. Any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. Each passenger already inside the howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.



### Howdah Saving Throws
While objects normally automatically fail all Strength, Dexterity, and Constituion saving throws, howdahs are active parts of combat, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, you can use the following rules when howdahs are subject to such saving throws.



<img src='https://i.ibb.co/GtD871x/Linebreaker-Baloth-Dominaria-United-Mt-G-Art-1024x752.jpg' style='position:absolute; bottom:-110px; right:-80px; width:930px; transform:scaleX(1)' />

  style='position:absolute;left:-290px;bottom:140px;transform:rotate(0deg)' />

\pagebreakNum

#### Strength & Dexterity Saves
Howdahs equipped on an unencumbered steed do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as they can rely on their steed to make the save for them. If a howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, its steed must make the saving throw against the effect. If the steed succeeds on the save, the howdah passes the save.

#### Constitution Saves
Howdahs can make their own Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is mounted on a steed.

### Opportunity Attacks
When the howdah steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the howdah itself. Passengers cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures outside the howdah.

### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures inside a howdah are considered to be within 5 feet of each other.

### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of three of the steed's largest hit dice.

### Teleporting
If the steed is teleported, the howdah and its riders can choose to teleport with it.

### Falling Howdahs
When a howdah's steed falls from a height of 10 feet or more, it and all its riders take fall damage as usual, and the riders fall prone.

### Repairing Howdahs
If a howdah has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting repairs, provided it has the necessary tools and parts. After 1 hour of work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus if proficient with the required tools. On success, the howdah regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. On failure, the howdah doesn't regain any hit points, but repairs can be reattempted with the same tools and parts.

### Howdah Destruction
When a howdah is destroyed, riders that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of its steed.

<br>



\columnbreak


## Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, howdahs have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Howdah DC 
Whenever the howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, that creature uses this value for the DC.

### Damage Threshold
Most howdahs possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the howdah takes the damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the howdah's hit points.

###  Steed Size
This is the minimum size a creature must be to be the howdah's steed. If a creature ever becomes too small to carry the howdah, the howdah falls off the creature and is knocked over as though its steed was knocked prone, described in the Prone Howdahs section.

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride in the howdah comfortably. Additional creatures may be able to fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the howdah at the DM's discretion.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the howdah adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning howdah, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the howdah is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits the howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

### Siege Weapons
A howdah may have one or more built-in siege weapons. These siege weapons are built into the howdah and share its Hit Points, AC, and Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the howdah is destroyed. These siege weapons can only be operated by riders in the howdah, and riders can't provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the howdah while operating these weapons. The weapons can't be used if the howdah is not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.
