### Ceradon Tactics

Ceradons are territorial, highly aggressive, and omnivorous creatures. While they don't actively hunt prey, they will readily attack anything within charging distance. In battle, a ceradon is resolute and acts primarily on instinct. It focuses on adversaries it perceives as the greatest threat, often choosing targets dealing significant damage or those of considerable size. However, it lacks the intelligence to realize the potential benefits of trampling multiple targets for increased damage output.

If a ceradon starts an encounter already in melee combat, it will retreat, even if doing so exposes itself to opportunity attacks. To defend against such attacks, it employs its Armoured Crest reaction. Following the retreat, it starts charging foes with its Trample action. The ceradon will follow this up with its Gore attack. While it can't gore a target right beneath it, it can trample over a target before circling back to Gore, often doing so with an advantage. Once an opponent is impaled on its horns, the ceradon shifts focus to trampling nearby threats. If it pins another creature under its feet, it will continue its stomp attacks while standing atop the pinned foe.

#### Ceradons With Howdahs

Ceradons equipped with a howdah can display tactical battle acumen under their rider's guidance. They frequently trample through dense clusters of enemies. Even if their Gore attack misses, if the ceradon pins two or more creatures beneath it, it remains stationary, concentrating on crushing them. 

The Armoured Crest reaction is used strategically, saved for countering potent spell attacks or deflecting high damage strikes, such as a rogue's sneak attack.

##### Ceradon Howdah Weapons 

Skinks usually man the ceradon's howdah. They employ long-range poison weapons integrated into the howdah to target enemies beyond the ceradon's reach, especially when the ceradon is stationary because it's pinning victims or it's pursuing elusive targets.

#### The Thunderous One 

**Thunderous Wrath:** When the Thunderous One utilizes this ability, it repels adversaries not restrained by its feet or impaled on its horns, creating distance between it and its next target for an effective charge and Gore attack.

##### Thunderous One Legendary Actions

The Thunderous One utilizes its legendary actions in the following ways:

**Storm God's Judgement:** This legendary action is reserved for use against a creature impaled on the ceradon's horns or trapped beneath its feet. The Thunderous One instinctively employs this legendary action in this way, even without external guidance.

**Trample:** If there are no eligible targets for Storm God's Judgement, the Thunderous One defaults to this action. When under the guidance of more intelligent beings, it prefers to use this ability if it can potentially overrun more adversaries than those already pinned beneath it.

**Tenacious Will:** This action is invoked solely when its stomping and goring abilities are hindered or interrupted.


#### Engine of the Gods 

When operating a howdah equipped with an Engine of the Gods, understanding the sequence of how abilities should be used is crucial. Here's the recommended priority order:

1. Portent of Warding
2. Sacred Summon
3. Time Slows
4. Arcane Configuration
5. Burning Alignment
6. Healing Light

# Howdah
War howdahs are small armored structured mounted to the backs of large war beasts that can hold multiple creatures. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use different types of howdahs in your games. They can be applied to howdahs of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own howdahs. 

## Howdah Rules
Howdahs are generally structures that provide cover to multiple creatures mounted on a larger war beast of some kind. The creatures within the howdah are referred to as riders, and the creature the howdah is mounted upon is referred to as its steed. If one of the riders is controlling the steed, that creature is the pilot. Howdah riders and steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Entering & Exiting Howdahs.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the steed is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the steed succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah. Any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted, and it can't try to enter again until the start of its next turn. Each passenger already inside the howdah may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting the howdah.

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a howdah or its steed, the howdah and its steed are moved together.

* **Controlled & Independant Steeds.** The howdah's steed can be a controlled or independent mount as described in the player's handbook. If it is controlled, there must be a pilot who is controlling it.


### Howdah Saving Throws
While objects normally automatically fail all Strength, Dexterity, and Constituion saving throws, howdahs are active parts of combat, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, you can use the following rules when howdahs are subject to such saving throws.

#### Strength & Dexterity Saves
Howdahs equipped on an unencumbered steed do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws, as they can rely on their steed to make the save for them. If a howdah is subjected to a Strength or Dexterity saving throw, its steed must make the saving throw against the effect. If the steed succeeds on the save, the howdah passes the save.

\columnbreak

#### Constitution Saves
Howdahs can make their own Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The howdah may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is mounted on a steed.

### Opportunity Attacks
When the howdah steed provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the howdah itself. Passengers cannot provoke opportunity attacks from creatures outside the howdah.

### Spacing Within Howdah
All creatures inside a howdah are considered to be within 5 feet of each other.

### Prone Howdahs
If the steed is knocked prone, the howdah takes bludgeoning damage equal to a roll of three of the steed's largest hit dice.

### Teleporting
If the steed is teleported, the howdah and its riders can choose to teleport with it.

### Falling Howdahs
When a howdah's steed falls from a height of 10 feet or more, it and all its riders take fall damage as usual, and the riders fall prone.

### Repairing Howdahs
If a howdah has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting repairs, provided it has the necessary tools and parts. After 1 hour of work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus if proficient with the required tools. On success, the howdah regains 2d4 + the creature's Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. On failure, the howdah doesn't regain any hit points, but repairs can be reattempted with the same tools and parts.

### Howdah Destruction
When a howdah is destroyed, riders that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of its steed.


\pagebreakNum


## Howdah Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, howdahs have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Howdah DC 
Whenever the howdah requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, that creature uses this value for the DC.

### Damage Threshold
Most howdahs possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A howdah with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the howdah takes the damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the howdah's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the howdah's hit points.

###  Steed Size
This is the minimum size a creature must be to be the howdah's steed. If a creature ever becomes too small to carry the howdah, the howdah falls off the creature and is knocked over as though its steed was knocked prone, described in the Prone Howdahs section.

### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride in the howdah comfortably. Additional creatures may be able to fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the howdah at the DM's discretion.

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the howdah adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning howdah, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the howdah is an additional creature with its own CR.

### Passive Traits
This section describes any traits the howdah has that don't
require actions to utilize.

### Siege Weapons
A howdah may have one or more built-in siege weapons. These siege weapons are built into the howdah and share its Hit Points, AC, and Damage Threshold and are destroyed when the howdah is destroyed. These siege weapons can only be operated by riders in the howdah, and riders can't provoke attacks of opportunity from creatures outside the howdah while operating these weapons. The weapons can't be used if the howdah is not attached to a steed or the steed is prone.

## Lizardmen Howdah Upgrades


Huge Howdah and Large Howdah can gain flowing upgrades, each upgrade increases its CR by 1


### Sacred Howdah
The howdah counts as a magic object, and the three-quarters cover granted by the howdah gives a +5 bonus to all saving throws from effects outside the howdah, not just Dexterity saves. If a creature in the howdah is subjected to an effect from outside that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half damage if it fails.

> ***Prep.*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done while it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The ballista fires a bolt that flies in a straight line up to 480 feet in the direction of the user's choice before falling to the ground. If the bolt would strike a target, that target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if the bolt has flown 120 feet or more. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or destroyed, the bolt keeps flying and deals 11 (2d10) less damage if it hits another target. Otherwise, the bolt's flight ends at the target's location.

>
> ***Prep.*** The weapon is prepped to fire its next shot. This prep must be done while it is loaded.
>
> ***Fire.*** The blowpipe fires a barrage of darts that rain down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot radius centered on that point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (5d4) piercing damage, is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, and makes the saving throw at the end of its turn against the toxins with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage, is still inflicted with Jungle Toxins, but does not have disadvantage on the saving throw at the end of its turn against the toxins.

> ##### Jungle Toxins
> At the end of the turn, each creature hit by one or more weapons that inflict Jungle Toxins must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that has been hit by two or more attacks from weapons with Jungle Toxins this turn makes the saving throw with disadvantage. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success or taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failure.

## Engine of the Gods 

A howdah can be equipped with an Engine of the Gods, which causes the howdah to be treated as a magical object. The engine has 3 charges by default and can possess up to 3 of the abilities listed below. For each ability beyond the first, grant it an additional charge. Riders with the howdah who have proficiency in Religion and a Wisdom and Intelligence of 14 or higher can use their action to expend 1 charge to activate one of the engine's abilities. The engine regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

The Engine of the Gods increases the CR of the Howdah by 4.

### Burning Alignment 
***As the engine comes into alignment, magical power is unleashed to scour the enemy.***

A vertical column of divine fire, 10 feet in radius and 100 feet high, descends at a point within 300 feet of the howdah of the user's choice. It then moves 30 feet horizontally in a straight line in the direction of the user's choice before dissipating. Each target the column passes through must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage and 14 (4d6) radiant damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful save. 

This ability cannot be used again for 3 rounds.

### Portent of Warding:
***Mysterious power pours from the engine, protecting nearby allies.***

When activating this ability, the rider chooses any number of creatures, and an aura of eldritch warding radiates from the howdah in a 30-foot radius for one minute. Each chosen creature in the aura gains resistance to damage from spells.

### Arcane Configuration:
***The engine siphons the winds of magic to aid in casting spells of specific energy.***

When activating this ability, the rider chooses a damage type and any number of creatures within 30 feet. The rider and all the chosen creatures then become empowered until the start of the rider's next turn. The next time an empowered creature casts a spell dealing the chosen damage type, it rolls three additional damage dice. (NOTE: How does this work on single target spells vs. AoE spells?) The rider activating this ability can also cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action as a bonus action on the same turn.

### Time Slows:
***The engine bends the flow of time.***

Each creature in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 300 feet of the howdah must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or be affected by the *slow* spell until the howdah is destroyed. (NOTE: Does the sphere move with the howdah?) A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. If it fails the repeat saving throw by 5 or more (DC 12), it is stunned until the effect ends.

### Healing Light:
***The engine releases a burst of light that heals battle-weary allies.***
When activating this ability, the rider chooses any number of creatures within 30 feet. Each chosen creature regains 18 (4d8) hit points.

### Sacred Summon:
***The engine calls to the heavens to summon a champion.***
A saurus sacred spawn appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the howdah of the rider's choice and remains until it or the howdah is reduced to 0 hit points or 10 minutes have passed. The saurus shares the initiative count of the rider who used the ability, and it takes its turn immediately after. The saurus is an ally to the rider and its companions.
