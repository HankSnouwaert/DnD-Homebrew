>
> ***Multiattack.*** The dread saurian can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes a claw attack against any number of targets in a 10-foot-long and 20-foot-wide area that emanates from the dread saurian in a direction of its choice. It can replace one of the attacks with Bite or Crushing Jaws. It can then immediately make a tail attack against any number of targets in a 30-foot-long and 20-foot-wide area that emanates from the dread saurian in the opposite direction of its claw attacks. The dread saurian can't move between attacks.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +15 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 41 (5d12 + 9) piercing damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 24). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the dread saurian can't bite another target.

> ### Reactions
>
> ***Wounded Charge.*** When the dread saurian's hit points drop to 0 or it triggers its Primal Instinct ability, it can use its Obliterating Charge action. After using this action, the dread saurian dies if its hit points are 0.

### Dread Saurian Artifacts

The dread saurian can be equipped with a magical artifact that grants it additional abilities and increases its CR by 2.

#### Spirit Eye

*A mystic crystal is embedded in the dread saurian, which allows it to call forth primal warriors from ages past.*

At the start of its turn, the dread saurian can summon three specters in unoccupied spaces within 90 feet of it. The specters act immediately after the dread saurian on the same initiative count and fight until they are destroyed. They disappear after 1 minute or when the dread saurian dies. The specters summoned with this ability have the following changes:
* They are not affected by Sunlight Sensitivity.
* They have a melee spell attack instead of Life Drain. The attack has a +8 to hit, a reach of 5 feet, and targets one creature. On a hit, the attack deals 10 (3d6) force damage


#### Heart of Stone

*A large, eldritch stone is fused into the back of the dread saurian. The dread saurian can use the stone to draw the power of the earth into its body and become as unyielding as a mountain.*

At the end of the dread saurian's turn, if it has not moved on that turn and is standing on earth or stone, it gains a +3 bonus to AC, saving throws, and opposed checks. This ability can stack up to two times. The dread saurian loses all stacks if it moves or is forced to move.

While equipped with this artifact, the dread saurian's Primal Instinct ability is triggered only by it becoming charmed or frightened.



#### Mantle of the Blazing Dawn 

*Strange golden patterns are etched across the dread saurian’s scales. As the beast charges, the markings flare and burn with divine radiance.*

Claw attacks made by the dread saurian when using its Obliterating Charge ability deal an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage and 10 (3d6) radiant damage on hit.


#### Primal Jaws

*The dread saurian’s teeth are etched with runes and gilded with rare metal to honor the most ancient of bestial gods. When the dread suarian crushes foes with its sacred jaws, it awakens a primal vigor in its allies.*

When the dread saurian uses its Crushing Jaws on a hostile creature, it and each ally within 100 feet of it gain 20 temporary hit points for the next minute. If the creature fails the saving throw against Crushing Jaws, they each gain 30 temporary hit points instead. If it fails by 10 or more, they each gain 40 temporary hit points instead.

#### Rebus of the Jungle

*Stange, magical, light-bending vines grow across the dread saurian and help mask its presence. These plants also help it to move through dense undergrowth undetected by its prey.*   

dread saurian gets + 11 to stealth checks and can move though plants without being slowed, taking damage, being grappled or restrained.

While dread saurian lightly obscured, it is invisible to any creatures more then 10 feet away form it. If the dread saurian has a Howdah, the Howdah and the  Creatures inside of it gain this benefit as well

#### Figures of Dread

*The dread saurian wears a massive headdress lined with menacing statues, amplifying its already terrifying nature such that none can look upon it without experiencing mortal terror.*

The following ability replaces the dread saurian’s Frightful Presence:

 ***Dread Presence.*** Each creature of the dread saurian's choice within 120 feet that is aware of it must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. All creatures have disadvantage on the saving throw unless they are within 5 feet of an ally. Creatures normally immune to being frightened can still be affected, but have advantage on their saves. While frightened, the creature can only use its actions to Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Hide, or steel its resolve. A creature that uses its action to steel its resolve can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature succeeds on the saving throw or the effect ends, it becomes immune to the dread saurian's Dread Presence for the next 24 hours.

### Howdah 

You can choose to equip a dread saurian with a small, armored fort on its back known as a howdah. This howdah is a magic object with 100 hit points and an AC 19. Up to 10 Medium or smaller creatures can ride in the howdah without squeezing. All creatures within the howdah count as being within 5 feet of each other.

**Entering the Howdah.** While there is space in the howdah, a creature can spend all its movement to enter or leave the howdah or only half its movement if it has a climbing speed. While the dread saurian is not incapacitated, it can make an opposed Strength (Athletics) check against a creature attempting to enter the howdah. If the dread saurian succeeds, the creature can't enter the howdah until the start of its next turn, and any movement it used to try to enter the howdah is wasted. The dread saurian may then immediately make an opportunity attack against the creature. If the dread saurian fails, the creature enters the howdah.

**Melee Attacks Against Creatures Within The Howdah.** To make a melee attack against a target in the howdah while outside of it, a creature must be within 5 feet of the dread saurian, and if the creature isn’t Huge or larger, the attack must have a reach of at least 20 feet.

**Protective Effects** When creatures are in the howdah, they are protected by powerful wards. They have three-quarters cover against attacks and effects from outside of it and a +5 bonus to all saving throws, not just Dexterity saves. If a creature in the howdah is subjected to an effect from outside that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and half damage if it fails.

**Being Knocked Prone** If the dread saurian is knocked prone, the howdah takes 30 bludgeoning damage.

**Teleporting.** If the dread saurian is teleported, howdah is teleported with it. Creatures in the howdah may choose to teleport with the dread saurian.

**Destruction.** If the dread saurian dies, the howdah is destroyed. When the howdah is destroyed, creatures that were in it are knocked prone and land in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of the dread saurian.

#### Howdah Weapons

The howdah has built-in weapons that can be fired by the creature's within. Each weapon can only be fired once per turn.

##### Giant Bow

When using a giant bow, it takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. The creature aiming the weapon chooses the target and must also be the one to fire it. When fired, the arrow flies in a straight line up to 480 feet in a direction of the user's choice before falling to the ground.

If the arrow would strike a target, the target must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if the arrow has flown 120 feet or more. On a failed save, the target takes 33 (6d10) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points or destroyed, the bolt keeps flying and deals 11 (2d10) less damage if it hits another target. Otherwise, the arrow's flight ends early.


##### Giant Blowpipe

When using a giant blowpipe, it takes one action to load the weapon, one action to aim it, and one action to fire it. The creature aiming the weapon must be the one to fire it. When fired, it does the following:

Darts rain down at a point of the user's choice within 120 feet. Each creature in a 5-foot radius centered on the point must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12 (5d4) piercing damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, and makes the saving throw at the end of its turn against the poison with disadvantage. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and is inflicted with Jungle Toxins, but does not have disadvantage on the saving throw at the end of its turn against the poison.


> ##### Jungle Toxins
> At the end of the turn, each creature hit by one or more weapons that inflict Jungle Toxins must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour. A creature that has been hit by two or more attacks from weapons with Jungle Toxins this turn makes the saving throw with disadvantage. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success or taking 5 (2d4) poison damage on a failure.
