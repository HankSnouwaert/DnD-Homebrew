## Razorsaurs

Razorsaurs are naturally found in dense jungles, swamplands, and occasionally in arid plateaus. Within the dense vegetation of their habitats, razorsaurs utilize their ability to launch spines to hunt prey or deter larger predators. These creatures are highly territorial and will almost never back down from a threat.

Skinks have learned how to keep razorsaurs in captivity for use as beasts of war. In combat, skink handlers guide the razorsaurs, relying on their natural aggression and defensive capabilities.

When goaded by their handlers, razorsaurs unleash a hail of spines, turning them into deadly living ballistae.

These capabilities allow razorsaurs to play a critical role in lizardmen strategies. Forming the backbone of their ranged artillery, these creatures can quickly decimate infantry ranks with their barrage of spines. They are also adept at charging into enemy lines, using tooth and claw to wreak havoc.

#### Venomous Razorsaurs
This rare subspecies is prized by lizardmen for its poisonous spines. Found only in the deepest wilds, venomous razorsaurs are more patient than their kin, relying on their toxic spines to slowly sap the life from their prey before moving in for the kill. In war, their skink handlers use them to debilitate entire regiments of enemy soldiers, leaving them easy prey for.

### Razorsaur Tactics



&emsp;**In the Wild.** In their wetland homes, razorsaurs operate as ambush predators, typically stalking their prey through thick vegetation or by partially immersing themselves in water. Upon coming within 100 feet of their target, they release a barrage of spikes to incapacitate their prey. If the prey appears severely wounded and near death, the razorsaur moves in to deliver the fatal blow using its claws and teeth, preferring not to expend unnecessary spikes. However, if the prey still seems healthy and able to flee, the razorsaur often opts not to pursue, deeming the prey not worth the effort. Regardless of the situation, a razorsaur never flees, instead choosing to stand its ground defensively, flinging spikes at any aggressors. The razorsaur always uses its Instinctive Defense reaction when able.


**With Animal Handlers.** When directed by intelligent handlers, the razorsaur can act as a living artillery piece. Spiky Hide and Instinctive Defense provide it with a substantial deterrence against melee attackers, enabling its handlers to guide it towards enemy spellcasters and ranged attackers without facing less hindrance. Regardless of their training, razorsaurs always use their Instinctive Defense when possible, as their instincts cannot be fully suppressed.

#### Venomous Razorsaurs

&emsp;**In the Wild.** In the wild, venomous razorsaurs display a more patient approach than their ordinary counterparts. Their Razorsaur Toxins enable them to execute hit-and-run tactics, maintaining a safe distance while their poison takes effect. They always stay within firing range but avoid closing in until their prey has been significantly weakened and shows little sign of resistance. If a creature resists the toxins, the razorsaur will cease pursuit to avoid wasting spikes.

**With Animal Handlers.** When under the command of animal handlers, venomous razorsaurs serve as debuffers, spreading their poisonous spike attacks out among as many targets as possible. If one target is a greater threat, the razorsaur will allocate two of its spikes for that specific adversary to increase the odds of it being poisoned.

### Razorsaur Loot
The valuable items looted from razorsaurs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a razorsaur. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Razorsaur Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Razorsaur Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1 5gp Item |

|  11-16 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items  |  
|  17-22 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items |  
|  23+ |  2d4(5) 10gp Items |
