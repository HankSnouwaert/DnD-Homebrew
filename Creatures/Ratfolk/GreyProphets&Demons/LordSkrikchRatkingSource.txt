## Lord Skrikch Ratking
*Demonic Embodiment of The Sinister Rat Council*<br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual, Religious  <br>
In the deeps of the world, where light dares not linger, there festered the ratfolk, a verminous brood whose hearts were as black as the caverns they skulked. Within moldering tombs and upon tablets of worn stone, their sinister chronicles were graven—tales of treachery and guile wrought in ages forgotten. Yet one tale, darkest of all, looms above the rest, its words steeped in such evil.

In that ancient time, the Rat God, a deity of greatest malice, summoned the most cunning and ruthless of his kind to a grand council. The lands above lay in disarray, their nations frail and faltering, ripe for conquest. The Rat God, in his verminous ambition, sought to bind his vassals under one purpose: to overrun the surface and claim dominion over all. 

Yet, as the ratfolk’s agents sowed sabotage and discord above, breaking the strength of men and their kingdoms, the council’s unity unraveled. Each member, black-hearted and covetous, nursed dreams of sole supremacy. Treachery spread like plague. Armies turned upon armies; assassins crept in every shadow. Tunnels and caverns, the very veins of their underworld, collapsed in the chaos. The opportunity to seize the world above slipped through their claws, and the ratfolk’s empire crumbled into shambles.

So great was the wrath of the Rat God that the veil of reality itself tore asunder. For a fleeting moment, the barrier between his hellish realm and the mortal world parted. Clawed hands reached forth from the abyss, seizing the bickering councilmembers who yet survived. Dragged shrieking into the shadows, they were cast into the forsaken depths of their god’s domain, a place where Time itself turned its back. There, amidst the ghosts of their murdered kin—slain in their own climb to power—they cowered.

The Rat God, in his spite, departed, leaving his treacherous congregants to waste through an eternity uncounted. Lamentations rose, accusations echoed, a ceaseless cacophony in the void. The abandoned souls, famished, fed upon the misery and hatred that permeated their prison, for death granted no release. Yet, in time, the Rat God, moved by the dark virtues of his flock—the very traits of cunning and malice for which he favored them—did show mercy. He loosed them from their prison, only to behold a twitching mass of flesh and souls, fused as one, crawling forth from the pit of despair.

The Rat God gazed upon this unintended creation and resolved to shape it into his greatest servant. By his dread power, the mass was forged into a demon, Skrikch Ratking, within whose form writhed the myriad knaveries of the fallen council.

<br><br><br><br>

Bound within its chest were four orbs, each a testament to the ratfolk’s essence: one encrusted with green pestilence, symbol of their plague; one slick with crimson blood, icon of their ruthless guile; one swirling with violet smoke, emblem of their shadowed machinations; and one crackling with green lightning, a mark of their ruinous sorcery and lust for dominion.

This epitome of vermin, driven by the unfulfilled ambitions of its makers, seeks ever to shatter the walls betwixt worlds. At the edges of existence, where reality grows thin, Skrikch Ratking prowls, yearning to fulfill the will of the Rat God and bring doom upon the realms above.

### Ratking's Lair
When Lord Skrikch Ratking enters the mortal realm, his foul presence perverts the world, causing darkness and disease to flourish. These gateways are opened by ratfolk, whose detestable traits are amplified in the presence of the vile demon.

#### Regional Effects  

The presence of Ratking has a drastic impact on his surroundings, spreading corruption within a 10-mile radius of his lair that causes the following effects:

* **Tainted Provisions.** Any food or potions left in the area for more than 24 hours become tainted until removed from the region for the same duration. Any creature that is not a rat, ratfolk, or demon that eats or drinks the tainted substance takes 16 (3d10) Necrotic damage.

* **Veil of Ratking.** While in darkness, any rat, ratfolk, or demon is invisible to creatures that are not rats, ratfolk, or demons if those creatures rely on Darkvision to see in that darkness.

* **Restless Corruption.** Creatures that are not rats, ratfolk, or demons cannot gain the benefits of a Long Rest.

* **Twisted Truth.** Rats, ratfolk, and demons within the region can present false thoughts and cannot be magically compelled to tell the truth. They may make a Charisma (Deception) check contested by the mind reader’s Wisdom (Insight) check to present false thoughts. Additionally, spells or effects that detect lies or compel truth indicate the creature is being truthful, if it so chooses. This applies even if the creature is knowingly lying.



### Epic Battle: Hearts of Ruination 
For a mythic encounter with Ratking, increase the hit points of each of his orbs to 200 hit points. Additionally, when the 3rd orb has been destroyed, have the last remaining orb gain 100 extra hitpoints that last until Ratking restores all of his orbs. This increases Ratking to a CR 27 encounter

### Will of the Rat God

You may grant Ratking the following ability. If you do, his CR increases by 2.

> ### Will of the Rat God
>  When Ratking rolls initiative, he calls upon the power of the Rat God. The Rat God's presence, which possesses an Intelligence of 24, acts autonomously and always in Ratking's best interest. For the next minute, or until Ratking dies, the Rat God's presence remains active. While active, it is aware of the location of any creature within 120 feet of Ratking.  
> On initiative count 30 (losing initiative ties), the Rat God triggers one of the following effects based on which orb has the least hit points. If two or more orbs are tied, the Rat God chooses which effect to use.
> 
> **Deceiver Orb: Mind Shroud** Two creatures within 150 feet of Ratking must make an Intelligence saving throw (DC 21). <br>
> *Failure:* The creature takes 13 (3d8) Psychic damage and is Mystified. While Mystified, the creature uses half its movement at the start of its turn to travel in a random direction (roll a d8 to determine direction) before taking the rest of its turn as normal. If only one orb is active, Ratking is also invisible to the creature until initiative count 30 of the next round. <br>
> *Success:* The creature takes half damage only. <br>
>
> **Warbringer Orb: Slashing Cyclone.** The Rat God chooses a point within 100 feet of Ratking. Each creature other than Ratking within 30 feet of that point must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 21. <br>
*Failure:* The creature takes 13 (3d8) Slashing damage and is pulled 20 feet toward the point. If only one orb is active, the creature also can’t regain hit points until initiative count 30 of the next round. <br>
*Success:* The creature takes half damage only. <br>
>
> **Corruptor Orb: Cloud of Filth.** A cloud of filth fills a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 150 feet of Ratking. The cloud lasts until initiative count 30 of the next round. If only one orb is active, the effect lasts 1 minute instead. The area becomes difficult terrain for creatures other than Ratking. Each creature other than Ratking that ends its turn in the area must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 21. <br>
*Failure:* The creature takes 16 (3d10) Necrotic damage. <br>
*Success:* The creature takes half damage only. <br>
>
> **Hexseer Orb: Overwhelming Static.** Two creatures within 150 feet of Ratking must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* (DC 21)  (the save is made with disadvantage if the creature is flying). <br>
*Failure:* The creature takes 16 (3d10) Lightning damage. If only one orb is active, the creature also has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws until initiative count 30 of the next round. <br>
*Success:* The creature takes half damage only.

### Lord Skrikch Ratking Tactics 

Skrikch Ratking's tactics vary depending on which of his orbs are destroyed first, as this is often determined by his foes' choices rather than his own. Below is a breakdown of his abilities and tactical priorities for each orb and the Will of the Rat God.

#### Orb Abilities and Tactics
&emsp;***Deceiver Orb: Assassinate.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Target isolated enemies whenever possible. Skrikch should use his movement to position himself near a lone target. <br>
**Priorities:** If the Warbringer Orb's Bloody Arc ability is still active, prioritize targets with healing abilities or high medicine checks.
If the Hexseer Orb's Hex Lightning Storm is the only other active orb, focus on targets capable of removing Fatigue.

***Warbringer Orb: Bloody Arc.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Aim to hit as many targets as possible, particularly those with low Dexterity, to spread wounds across multiple enemies, making it harder for them to recover. <br>
**Priorities:** Maximize the number of affected targets to overwhelm foes with cumulative wounds.

***Corruptor Orb: Defiled Ground.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Target as many enemies as possible. If one or more other orbs have been destroyed, use this ability to daze creatures, preventing them from escaping Bloody Arc or Hex Lightning Storm. <br>
**Priorities:** Focus on crowd control to hinder enemy movement and coordination.

***Hexseer Orb: Hex-Lightning Storm.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Hit as many targets as possible. Once Hex Lightning Storm begins causing Fatigue, Skrikch will prioritize targets that already have Fatigue levels. <br>
**Priorities:** Amplify the effect of Fatigue by focusing on already-fatigued enemies to debilitate them further.

#### Will of the Rat God Abilities and Tactics
&emsp;***Deceiver Orb: Mind Shroud.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Use to keep targets separated from one another, disrupting their ability to coordinate. <br>
**Priorities:** If only one orb remains, target creatures that heavily rely on Advantage, such as rogues or other martial fighters, to neutralize their effectiveness. <br>

***Warbringer Orb: Slashing Cyclone.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Use to pull targets closer together, setting them up for Bloody Arc. <br>
**Priorities:** If only one orb remains, target enemies with a high number of wounds to prevent them from healing effectively.

***Corruptor Orb: Cloud of Filth.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Deploy to force opponents out of favorable positions, disrupting their tactical advantage. <br>
**Priorities:** Use strategically to control the battlefield and expose enemies to further attacks.<br>

***Hexseer Orb: Overwhelming Static.*** <br>
**Tactic:** Target two creatures with low Dexterity saving throws or those who have accumulated the most Fatigue.<br>
**Priorities:** Focus on enemies already weakened by Fatigue or those vulnerable to Dexterity-based effects to maximize impact.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

> ##### New Condition: Fatigue
> The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.
> 
> **Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.
> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue. 

> ##### New Condition: Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
> 
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.
