## Thanqual
*Grand Mastermind Among <br> Ratfolk Grey Prophets* <br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark, Urban; <br> **Treasure:** Arcane, Relic

Deep beneath the lawful empires of the world lurk insidious syndicates and diabolical cults, festering blights that burrow through society’s rotting core. Yet even these vile organizations are but puppets, their strings pulled by a far more malevolent mind. A web of villainy spans the great civilizations of the world, tangled and knotted with contradictory plots and overlapping schemes. At the center of this chaos sits Thanqual, the twitching, self-proclaimed Grand Mastermind Among Grey Prophets, a title he repeats often and loudly, especially when no one’s listening.

Thanqual is a schemer without equal, analyzing every opportunity from countless angles in an effort to climb the treacherous hierarchy of conniving ratfolk. But his brilliance is no accident. The frenzied pace of his mind is fueled by constant inhalation and consumption of toxic Hexstone. This substance not only sharpens his thoughts to a fever pitch, but also grants him access to devastating magical power that eclipses even his most gifted peers. This unnatural clarity, however, comes at a cost: his pupils are permanently dilated, his eyes bulge erratically, and his every movement is filled with a jittery, barely restrained madness.

Ingesting Hexstone has also extended Thanqual’s life far beyond that of any normal ratfolk. He is kept alive not just by its corrupting energy, but by a kind of twitchy prescience. It is not uncommon for him to suddenly leap aside, duck behind a pillar, or twist away from danger mere moments before an explosion or projectile strikes, as if some dark instinct tugs him clear of fate.

Thanqual juggles an overwhelming number of plots, alliances, betrayals, and grand conspiracies, most of which collapse under their own absurd complexity. Even the greatest human tactician would find it impossible to untangle the intricate threads of his schemes, and that’s assuming they were given decades and a full war council. Unsurprisingly, many of Thanqual’s grand designs end in spectacular catastrophe. Fortunately for the maniacal mastermind, the sheer number of henchmen, double agents, and expendable flunkies involved ensures that the blame always falls on someone else.

Yet failure is never the end. Each disaster is simply a stepping stone toward Thanqual’s ultimate ambition: total world domination.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 Deep in his subterranean lair, an unnecessarily convoluted maze of tunnels and traps, most of which even he no longer remembers, Thanqual plots anew. His latest plan involves a towering, mutated rat-ogre bodyguard, stitched together from salvaged flesh, embedded weaponry crafted by mad engineers, and the remains of his previous, less fortunate bodyguards.

Soon, Thanqual will strike. Nothing can stop him.

Except, perhaps, his own Hexstone addiction.

#### Regional Effects  
The presence of Thanqual has a drastic impact on his surroundings, spreading corruption within a 10-mile radius of his lair. This corruption causes the following effects:

* **Hidden Schemes.** Ratfolk in the region can’t be targeted by divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors unless the source of the magic is within 30 feet of the ratfolk.
* **Secret Passages.** Any ratfolk capable of casting 1st-level or higher spells can cast *Passwall* once using their spellcasting ability. Once they do so, they can’t cast the spell this way again until they finish a long rest.
* **Thanqual’s Gaze.** Thanqual can cast *Scrying* without expending a spell slot when targeting a creature within the region. The saving throw is always treated as if Thanqual is familiar with the target.

### Epic Battle: Thanqual & Bone Snapper
If you pair Thanqual with Bone Snapper, treat them as a CR 24 encounter.

>
> ### Monstrous Actions

### Thanqual's Tactics

#### Minion Positioning

Thanqual directs his minions to surround the enemy with the lowest AC, triggering Overwhelming Mass on all attacks via his Monstrous Actions.

#### Reactive Abilities
* **Hexed Intuition:** Used if failing the same saving throw would cause greater than 35 damage or Incapacitation
* **Hexed Scurry:** Activated when surrounded by 3 or more enemies
* **Hexed Recovery:** Activated when his health drops to 100 HP or less

#### Spellcasting Priority
Use *Unstable Discharge* when surrounded by three or more allies; otherwise, use *Lightning Bolt*.

#### Vermintide Summons
Thanqual always summons swarms directly adjacent to foes to trigger Overwhelming Mass.


#### Monstrous Actions
| Action  | Targeting Priority |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Flensing Ribbons  | Lowest AC or target surrounded by multiple allies (all focused on one target) |
|  Scorching Terror  | Spread across enemies to maximize fear |
|  Galvanic Bolts  | Distributed among multiple targets; intentionally hits own minions to Quicken them |

#### Bone Snapper
Moves to the lowest-AC target to enable Overwhelming Mass. Follows with Hexfire Throwers on the largest nearby enemy cluster.

> ##### New Condiiton: Rampaging
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.

##### Thanqual Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Spark in the Spire.** Hex-lightning storms surge unnaturally around a tall spire. Unknown to most, Thanqual is conducting a ritual within its highest chamber to tear open a new route between realms. The party must scale the spire, dodging ratfolk sabotage, unstable magic, and collapsing reality, to stop him. |
|  2  | **The Needle of Prophecy.** Thanqual has embedded a sliver of hexstone into the corpse of a saint, turning its shrine into a beacon of false miracles. Pilgrims gather, unaware that their prayers are being redirected, twisting fate itself to empower the Thanqual's next ritual. |
|  3  | **The Baited God.** Thanqual claims he has summoned a fragment of his rat god into a hexstone idol and intends to “feed it” powerful souls to earn divine favor. The party must stop the ritual before whatever is actually trapped within the idol consumes everything around it. |
|  4  |**Warpquake Scheme.** In an effort to destroy a rival ratfolk warren, Thanqual attempts to collapse a mountain using chained hexstone explosions. The adventurers must either evacuate a nearby dwarven outpost or venture into the collapsing tunnels to stop the chain reaction before it swallows an entire region. |
|  5  | **The Verminscam.** Thanqual convinces several surface warlords that their enemies are about to be invaded by ratfolk and sells them “anti-vermin artifacts” (which are actually homing beacons for a vermin tide). The adventurers uncover the con too late and now must defend the towns while exposing the Thanqual's scam.|
|  6  |**The Hero of the Empire.** Thanqual assumes a disguise as a surface prophet and begins staging his own rescues from disasters he secretly caused, leading him to gain worshipers, influence, and relics.

### Thanqual Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying which materials they're carrying that have functional value.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. 


#### Thanqual Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Thanqual Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 2d4(5) 500gp Items |
|  10-12 | 2d4(5) 500gp Items | 
|  13-19 | 2d6(7) 1,000gp Items  |  
|  20-24 | 2d4(2) 2,000gp Items |  
|  25+ |  2d6(7) 2,000gp Items | 

##### Thanqual & Bone Snapper Loot Table

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.



> ##### Notes on 2024 Burning Rules
> If you're using the rules for burning described in the 2024 edition of D&D, these are the changes that were made in this document:
> * **Sources of Burning Don't Stack.** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
> * **Damage At End of Turn.** Burning damage occurs at the end of a creature's turn rather than the beginning. This gives the creature the chance to try to end the condition before taking the damage, thus giving players more agency when they start burning.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.



> ##### New Condition: Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
> 
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.
