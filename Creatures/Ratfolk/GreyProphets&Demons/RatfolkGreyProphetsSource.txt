## Ratfolk Grey <br> Prophets
*Eldritch Conduits of The Sinister Rat God* <br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark, Urban; <br> **Treasure:** Arcane, Relic

These eldritch ratfolk are born with grey <br> or white fur and small horns that set <br> them apart from their kin and mark <br> them for a path of arcane greatness. <br> They are taken from their litter to be <br> trained in the dark arts of eldritch <br> magic so that their dark potential <br> may one day be realized. During their <br> training, they are referred to as grey <br> maguses, and while they can wield <br> potent magic, they do not carry <br> nearly the same power or status as <br> a grey prophet. The trials and <br> training a magus must undertake <br> are brutal, and most die horrendous <br> deaths early in their careers. Those <br> few who claw their way to the highest <br> pinnacles of eldritch power become <br> grey prophets, the spiritual leaders <br> of ratfolk society who serve as <br> messengers for their verminous god.

The favor of the rat god is made <br> evident through the grey prophet's <br> devastating magical abilities. Using <br> their ruinous magic, these ratfolk <br> can conjure blasts of elemental <br> magic, summon massive rat tides, <br> or drive their allies into <br> self-destructive battle frenzies. They <br> are also notoriously difficult to pin <br> down in combat, able to scurry just <br> out of reach before unleashing their <br> destructive magic. The protection <br> of the rat god is ever-present, and <br> even those able to make seemingly <br> accurate attacks against a grey prophet <br> will often find their strikes suddenly veer <br> off course, or their spells lose potency just <br> as they reach their target.



##### Ratfolk Grey Prophet Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Trial By Hexfire.** As a trio of grey maguses compete to prove their worth to their eldritch masters, they take up residence in a swamp where they work to twist the will of local creatures and unleash them on nearby settlements.  |
|  2  |  **The Mad Aspirant.** A grey magus, driven mad by his eldritch trials, has fled into the sewers where he has begun unleashing unstable magic, drawing other ratfolk and mutant beasts into his presence. |

|  3  | **Verminhood Cult.** A grey prophet has founded a doomsday cult among outcasts and heretics, preaching the “Blessing of Verminhood.” Followers undergo hideous transformations into ratfolk and believe themselves chosen.    |
|  4  | **The 13 Falsehoods** In thirteen towns, warped effigies have appeared overnight, each depicting the same robed figure with burning eyes and a rat’s tail. Wherever one is burned or defiled, disaster follows. Players must find the grey prophet responsible and find a way to destroy the effigies.  |
|  5  | **The Blasphemous Script** A cursed scroll written by a grey prophet has surfaced in a wizard’s library. Reading it grants visions of power, but also triggers warplightning storms and mass vermin infestations. The party must destroy the scroll before it is fully decoded. |
|  6  | **Eater of Secrets** A grey prophet is devouring the brains of captured scholars and wizards to "consume their insight." The more he learns, the more intelligent (and unstable) he becomes. Now he’s set his sights on a famed seer known to the party.   |

### Ratfolk Grey Prophet and Magus Tactics

The tactics of a Ratfolk Grey Prophet or Magus vary depending on their chosen lore: Lore of Vermin or Lore of Decay.  


#### General Abilities

**Summoning Swarms.** This trait can be used on a turn to surprise enemies and allow the Ratfolk’s Overwhelming Mass to trigger. This works best when combined with a **Flensing Ribbons** spell.

**Hex Staff.** Used to escape from melee combat, allowing the caster to reposition or retreat.


#### Lore of Vermin

With this lore, the Ratfolk excels at using spell attacks and leverages its Overwhelming Mass trait to deal significant damage by summoning swarms or tides of rats.  This lore focuses on overwhelming enemies with numbers and strategic spell use.

##### Spellcasting Order and Tactics

1. **Fissure.** Use to trap enemies, creating difficult terrain and hindering their approach. Stay cautious to avoid being pushed or pulled into the fissure.

2. **Flensing Ribbons.**  Use when a target is surrounded by three or more allies, as each extra ray deals an additional 3d4 damage on a hit.

3. **Death Frenzy.**  Cast to enhance both the rat swarm and the caster. Follow with *Unstable Blast* to deal additional damage.

4. **Scorching Terror.** Use to deter enemies approaching too closely or to scare off healers who might heal the wounds from *Flensing Ribbons*.


\columnbreak

5. **Galvanic Bolts.** Spread the three bolts across multiple spread-out targets to maximize damage. If enemies are grouped or a single target is surrounded by three or more allies, focus all bolts on a near-death target to prevent them from gaining the Quickened condition.  
The grey magus/prophet may intentionally fail the save to gain Quickened, allowing it to disengage, dash to safety, or use its *Hex Staff*.

#### Lore of Decay

With this lore, the grey magus/prophet specializes in dealing Necrotic damage in close-quarters combat, particularly when paired with allies like **Plague Disciples**.  

This lore thrives in cramped spaces where enemies are grouped up.

##### Spellcasting Order and Tactics

1. **Plague.** Cast before combat or on the first round to infect allies. Follow with *Chill Touch* to amplify Necrotic damage. Continue spreading *Plague* among allies to maintain its effects.

2. **Circle of Death.**  Cast immediately when it can hit three or more enemies. Follow by summoning rat swarms or tides to capitalize on the chaos. Avoid harming allies due to the spell’s high damage output.

3. **Flensing Ribbons.**  Grey prophets cast at it 5th level when a target is surrounded by three or more allies, with each extra ray dealing an additional 3d4 damage on hit. Otherwise, it's used at the 3rd level when no higher-level damage-dealing spells are available.

4. **Virulent Decay.** Cast when it can affect three or more enemies. Use allied creatures to spread the spell’s effects between enemy groups.

5. **Contagion.** Cast when an enemy is within 5 feet of the Ratfolk. Avoid using if *Circle of Death* or *Virulent Decay* can hit multiple enemies. Always target Constitution to impose disadvantage on its saves on the enemy.

### Ratfolk Grey Magus & Prophets Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying which materials they're carrying that have functional value.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Intelligence (Religion)** check. 


#### Ratfolk Grey Magus & Prophets Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## New Spells

### Lore of Decay
Spellcasters wielding magic of decay favor spells that inflict rot, disease, and entropy. While many existing D&D spells can represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this putrescent style of sorcery into your campaigns.

#### Plague (Revised)
*1st-level necromancy*  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S, M (a bit of rodent fur)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  

You become surrounded by pestilence for the duration of the spell.  

At the end of each of your turns, you may choose to infect a creature that you can see within 5 feet of you or within 5 feet of a creature already infected by this spell with disease. Then, each diseased creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is no longer infected by the disease and can't become infected by the spell for 24 hours. All diseases disappear when the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3.

- If you use a **3rd-level or higher** spell slot, choose an ability from the **Plague Symptom** table when you cast the spell. Creatures infected by this spell have Disadvantage on D20 Tests of the chosen ability not triggered by this spell.
- If you use a **6th-level or higher** spell slot, the diseased creatures have the Severe Symptom associated with the ability as well.

\columnbreak

##### Plague Symptom  
| d6  |Ability  | Severe Symptom |
|:---:|:-----------|:-----------|
|  1  | **Wisdom.** | **Rabid.** The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to take actions that allow it to make one or more attacks. |
|  2  | **Charisma.** | **Rotted Flesh.** Any attack that hits the creature scores a critical hit on a roll of 15-20 |
|  3  | **Constitution.** | **Nauseous.** The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and checks. |
|  4  | **Intelligence.** | **Befuddled.** The creature is dazed (see condition below). |
|  5  | **Strength.** | **Atrophied** The creature deals only half damage with attacks. |
|  6  | **Dexterity.** |**Dizzy.** The creature cannot benefit from the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Additionally, if the creature chooses to move more than 5 feet on its turn, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8.


> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

#### Virulent Decay
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

You unleash a bolt of decay toward a creature you can see within range, infecting it with necrotic energy. The infection can then spread to another creature of your choice within 5 feet of the first target and then to another creature within 5 feet of that one. This process can repeat until you've infected up to 4 creatures. A creature can only be infected once by this spell.

Each infected creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10, and the infection can jump one additional time for each spell slot level above 4.

### Lore of Ruin
This destructive brand of magic is frequently utilized by sinister grey prophets of the ratfolk. It includes magic that draws on the ruinous nature of the ratfolk to unleash radiant bolts of lightning, hurl terrifying flames, or rend giant fissures into the earth. Other spells emphasize their kinship with rats by allowing the caster to summon verminous swarms or drive allies into desperate, self-destructive frenzies when they're backed into a corner.

#### Death Frenzy
*2nd-level Transmutation (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock)* 
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sharp tooth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___

You send a creature into a frenzy that pushes its body beyond its limits. Choose a willing creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, whenever the creature makes an attack, it takes 1d6 Necrotic damage, which can’t be reduced in any way. The creature then gains a bonus to the attack roll and damage equal to the Necrotic damage taken.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 1st.

#### Fissure
*6th-level Evocation (Druid)* 
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S,
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long. The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep. If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure; any fall damage the creature takes is doubled from falling this way. Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side they move to. 

The fissure deals 50 Bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can increase the length by 20 feet and its depth by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

#### Unstable Discharge
*Evocation Cantrip (Artificer, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You send an erratic burst of electricity streaking toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 Lighting damage.

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.



> ##### Notes on 2024 Burning Rules
> If you're using the rules for burning described in the 2024 edition of D&D, these are the changes that were made in this document:
> * **Sources of Burning Don't Stack.** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
> * **Damage At End of Turn.** Burning damage occurs at the end of a creature's turn rather than the beginning. This gives the creature the chance to try to end the condition before taking the damage, thus giving players more agency when they start burning.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.



> ##### New Condition: Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
> 
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.
