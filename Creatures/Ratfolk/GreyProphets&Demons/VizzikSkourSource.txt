## Vizzik Skour, Prophet of the Rat
*Verminous Demon Herald of Apocolyptic Madness*<br>
**Habitat:** Extraplanar; **Treasure:** Arcane, Individual, Religious  <br>

They say within the shadows that loom in the deepest parts of the world, there are doorways to worlds beyond. From these ebon gateways a beast shall stride forth in dark pilgrimage, upon cloven hooves, with a pink worm-tail trailing behind it—prophet of the rat god, a creature wrought from his vile thought and will. A staff of gnawed wood shall be clutched in pale claws, and four horns shall twist in spirals from its verminous head; both are mantles of its dark authority, bestowed upon it by the god of ruin.

It shall move through the caverns of the earth, its eyes aglow with the vile dreams of its master, its voice a screeching concerto filled with hatred for the peoples of the surface world and their gods. The ratfolk that dwell below shall hear the echoes of such sermons, and behold the dancing images within its burning eyes, and be driven mad; their teeth shall gnash as they chitter prayers of war and decay, and they shall scurry forward in crazed fervour, ushered by that frenzy.

Then the beast of the rat god shall claw its way skyward, until its flaming eyes are set upon the heavens and the green rolling hills; there its song shall grow ever louder, its eyes filled with even greater nightmares. Those that catch its monstrous sight, or are subjected to its hymns, shall be consumed by insanity. And the air itself shall split from the strain of the unholy clamour that rampages about it; such wounds shall have teeth, and open unto a kingdom of terror, whence the devotees of the rat god shall spill forth from the maw, and it shall devour all else.

And the beast shall look upon all that which it has poisoned with its sermons, to the vile joy of the rat god; and the vermin’s children shall feast on one another in the ruined world that was, for there shall be none left for the creatures to hate but one another.

**Main Turn Priority.**
Attack a target he has Advantage via Gaze of the Prophet or surrounded by multiple allies to trigger Overwhelming Mass.

#### Oratory Screech

**Goal:** Hit as many allies + enemies as possible. <br>
**Priority:** Target enemies already at maximum Fury for maximum damage.<br>
**Positioning:** Ensure allied Warriors/Champions of Ruin are in the cone.<br>

#### Inflame Insanity
**Goal:** Reposition allies to set up Overwhelming Mass. <br>


#### Warriors/Champions of Ruin
* Focus-fire enemies with the highest Fury.
* Group up to trigger Overwhelming Mass on key targets.
* Always subject theme selfs to Gaze of the Prophet for more fury.
* Stay clustered for Oratory Screech inclusion.

#### Fissure in Reality: Swallow
**Goal:** Hit maximum enemies while avoiding allied Ratfolk. <br>
**Target Priority:** Low-Dexterity foes first.

>
> ### Traits
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** Vizzik can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than himself without squeezing.
>
> ***Gaze of the Prophet.*** When a creature that can see Vizzik’s eyes starts its turn within 30 feet of him, it must make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 20.  
> *Failure:* The target gains 1d3 levels of Fury* and takes 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage. If the target already has 6 or more levels of Fury, it takes 21 (6d6) Necrotic damage instead. This damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1.  
> Unless surprised or Rampaging*, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does, it can’t see Vizzik until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at Vizzik in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass.*** When Vizzik hits a creature with an attack, he deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage per ally he has within 5 feet of the target that isn’t Incapacitated (up to three allies).
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Unholy Staff.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) Bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Blight Spear.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +12 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (4d8) Necrotic damage.
>
> ***Prehensile Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 25 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) Slashing damage. 
> 
> If the target is Large or smaller, Vizzik can push or pull it up to 15 feet toward or away from himself.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Vizzik gains two additional actions in combat: Oratory Screech and Inflame Insanity. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count (losing ties), separate from Vizzik’s own, if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace any action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Oratory Screech (Initiative Count 20).*** Each creature in a 60 foot cone must make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 20.
>*Failure:* The target gains 1d3 levels of Fury* and takes 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage. If the target already has 6 or more levels of Fury, it takes 21 (6d6) Necrotic damage instead. This damage can’t reduce the target’s hit points below 1.  
>
> ***Inflame Insanity (Initiative Count 10).*** Each other creature within a 30-foot emanation must make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 20.  
> *Failure:* The creature begins Rampaging* until the end of its next turn. While Rampaging, the creature must use its Reaction to move up to half its speed toward nearest creature without provoking opportunity attacks and then make one melee weapon attack.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Vizzik is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.
>
> ### Fissure in Reality (1/Day)
>
> When Vizzik rolls initiative, he selects a point he can see within 90 feet and creates a 10-foot-radius fanged portal in that space. The portal has an Intelligence of 22, Blindsight out to 90 feet, acts autonomously, and always acts in Vizzik’s best interest. The portal remains active for 1 minute or until Vizzik dies. The portal creates the following effects on the initiative counts described below, losing ties.
>
> ***Vomit (Initiative Count 30).*** The portal creates two **Ratfolk Warriors of Ruin**** in unoccupied spaces within 10 feet of it. These ratfolk remain until destroyed or until the portal disappears. They act on their own turns, immediately after this action’s initiative count. The portal can have up to four Warriors of Ruin at a time from this feature.
>
> ***Swallow (Initiative Count 0).*** The portal moves up to 30 feet in a straight line. The first time it moves through a creature’s space, that creature must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 20.  
> *Failure:* The creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the duration. While banished, the creature is Incapacitated and takes 14 (4d6) Psychic damage at the end of each of its turns, then must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 20. On a success, it reappears in the nearest unoccupied space to the portal. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the realm of darkness, but any magical items it was wearing or carrying return with it.  
> *Success:* No effect.
>
> **New condition described on page after next* <br>
