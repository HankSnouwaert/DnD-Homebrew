|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Hell's Bell.** A ratfolk warhost prepares to wheel a screeching bell into a surface city, planning to ring it during a celestial convergence. If the bell sounds at the appointed moment, its resonance could tear open the veil between worlds and flood the region with chaos.  |
|  2  |  **Ringing In The Deep.** An ancient dwarven stronghold, long abandoned, now echoes with thunderous ringing heard from miles away. Deep within, a newly constructed screeching bell has been affixed atop a great hexstone vein, feeding magical instability into the region. The adventurers are sent to silence the sound before it causes regional devastation. |
|  3  | **The Thirteenth Toll.** At the peak of a desolate mountain, a ratfolk grey prophet has begun ringing a screeching bell at the top of every hour, causing unnatural storms to begin gathering. The players must reach the bell and stop it before it can ring for the thirteenth time and complete a dread ritual. |
|  4  |  **The Bellbound Beast.** A screeching bell has been mounted onto the back of a massive, mutated beast of war. The constant tolling drives nearby soldiers mad and inspires frenzied rampages among the ratfolk. The adventurers must slay the beast or sabotage the bell mid-battle before both overrun the battlefield. |
