> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
>
> ***Cornered Rat*** When the ratfolk is reduced to 0 hit and it took the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action on it's last turn, the ratfolk makes a bit attack against that creature with in 5 feet of it with advantage and it deals extra 2 (1d4) damage on hit.
