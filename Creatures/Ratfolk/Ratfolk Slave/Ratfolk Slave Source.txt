## Ratfolk Slaves

These ratfolk represent the bottom rung of their <br> society. Numerous and expendable, they are <br> responsible for the lowliest and most dangerous <br> tasks, from unskilled labor to grislily test subjects. <br> Their low quality of life and hazardous duties make <br> their lives mercifully short, and most ratfolk slaves accomplish little with the time they have. 

In battle, other ratfolk use their slaves as canon <br> fodder to bog down foes. Their expendable nature <br> means other ratfolk have few qualms about giving <br> them suicidal tasks, and ratfolk slaves are often <br> subjected to friendly fire from the spells and <br> artillery of their ratfolk “allies.” 

Despite their frail nature and inferior physical <br> abilities, these lowly ratfolk can be quite ferocious <br> when they feel they have the upper hand. They <br> relish the opportunity to be tormenters rather <br> than the tormented and will utilize every <br> underhanded tactic available to them. However, <br> these ratfolk are cowards among a race known <br> for cowardice, and the moment the fight turns <br> against them, they are prone to scurry away. <br> Ratfolk slaves who die a coward’s death are liable <br> to get one last spiteful bite in as recompense for <br> a short, meaningless life of fear and pain.

> ### Reactions
>
> ***Cornered Rat.*** When the ratfolk is reduced to 0 hit points, and it took the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action on its last turn, it makes a bite attack against a creature within 5 feet of it with advantage, dealing an extra 2 (1d4) damage on hit.
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
