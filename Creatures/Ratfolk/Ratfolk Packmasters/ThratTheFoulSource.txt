## Thrat, The Foul
Thrat, The Foul, stands as a grotesque paragon of ambition and madness among the ratfolk. With countless cycles behind him, he is one of the eldest and most revered—or feared—packlords within the depths of the ratfolk enclaves. His lair, a sprawling underground laboratory riddled with the remnants of failed experiments and the echoing cries of monstrous creations, serves as the heart of his dark empire.

Having dedicated his life to the unholy sciences of mutation and beastcraft, Thrat has perfected the art of fusing flesh and magic to create abominations that defy nature’s boundaries. His expertise lies not just in the creation but in the control of these beasts, employing a twisted combination of alchemical mutagens and sheer willpower. His body bears the marks of his profession; he is grotesquely bloated, a side effect of the mutagenic substances that course through his veins, enhancing his already formidable intellect and giving him a monstrous appetite. This supernatural metabolism forces Thrat to consume vast quantities of food, especially when exerting himself in his experiments or in combat.

Thrat wields two magical implements that symbolize his power: the Creature-Killer and the Whip of Domination. The Creature-Killer, a massive things-catcher, is outfitted with blades and arcane sigils, capable of grasping and rending the flesh of the mightiest beasts. The Whip of Domination, a long, sinuous whip crackling with eldritch energy, not only inflicts pain but also bends the will of any creature it strikes, ensuring their obedience.

Among the ratfolk, Thrat’s name is synonymous with both brilliance and horror. His creations are not merely beasts; they are masterpieces of terror, each reflecting his deranged genius. From multi-limbed rat ogres to chimeric horrors with the heads of predatory birds and the bodies of muscular wolves, Thrat’s menagerie is as diverse as it is deadly. His lab is a place of dark legend, known well to those who dare the deeper darkness of the world below.

Despite his bloated and seemingly cumbersome form, Thrat is a formidable foe in battle, relying on his magical weapons and the ferocity of his creations to dismantle any who oppose him. His reputation as a master of monstrosities deters most from even considering betrayal or confrontation. Yet, his constant hunger and the volatile nature of his experiments leave him always on the brink, driven by a never-ending desire to consume and create.

The ratfolk whisper of Thrat’s past deeds and the nightmares he has unleashed upon the world. Some say he seeks the ultimate mutation, a creature that combines all the strengths of the beasts he has mastered without any of their weaknesses—a living embodiment of his twisted vision of perfection. For now, though, Thrat continues to lurk in his lab, ever scheming, ever crafting, and forever feeding his insatiable appetite.

### Experimental Vats

If Thrat The Foul is encountered in his lair, you can enhance the challenge of the encounter by incorporating Experimental Vats. Each vat is a large magical object with an Armor Class (AC) of 16 and 60 hit points. Distribute one or more vats throughout the lair as desired. Each vat present increases Thrat's Challenge Rating (CR) by 1.

On initiative count 20 (losing ties), each vat spawns a **creeping experiment** with a random Experimental Attack. These experiments take their turns immediately after spawning. Each vat can spawn a maximum number of experiments (NOTE: What number?), enhancing the complexity and dynamics of the encounter.

### Thrat The Foul Tactics

**Minion Dependency:** Thrat constantly requires a supply of minions to command and consume to stave off his Ravening Hunger.

#### Attacks
**Creature-Killer:** Used when not grappling a target. This attack grants advantage to Thrat and his minions for future attacks, and should target foes with large hit dice and low AC.
Ravening 

**Bite:** Employed at least once each round to prevent the activation of Ravening Hunger. Target restrained creatures or consume corpses with beneficial mutations.

**Whip of Domination:** Primarily used with his Surge of Cruelty legendary action unless he is consuming a corpse or restraining a target with Creature-Killer.

#### Creeping Experiments Tactics
**Target Selection:** Thrat uses his mutagen ability to adapt to enemy tactics. (NOTE: He can't control which attack they have, right?)

**Acid Smear:** Used if the opponent has high AC or can impose disadvantage on attack rolls.

**Withering Touch:** Used if the opponent relies heavily on weapon attacks.

**Electrical Surge:** Employed against opponents who benefit significantly from bonus actions, such as monks or rogues.

**Flailing Limbs:** Used against opponents with lower than usual AC.

>|  4  | ***Flailing Limbs.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature and the experiment is under the effects of a mutagen, hit or miss, it makes another Flailing Limbs attack as a bonus action against the target with disadvantage. |

### Thrat, The Foul Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. 

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. In the case of a ninja sorcerer, you may use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check instead. 


#### Thrat, The Foul Loot Tables
The following table describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Thrat, The Foul Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-8  | 2d4(5) 100gp Items |
|  9-11 | 2d6(7) 100gp Items | 
|  12-18 | 1d6(3) 200gp Items  |  
|  19-23 | 2d4(5) 200gp Items |  
|  24+ |  2d6(7) 200gp Items |  


#### Example Thrat, The Foul Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Thrat, The Foul Item Names
|1d4 |  100gp Item | 200gp Item | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 <br> (Bone)  |  Thrat's Trophy Bone | Thrat's Special Trophy Bone |
| 2 <br> (Gem) | Warp Gem |  Pristine Warp Gem  | 
| 3 <br> (Hide) | Mutant Hide |  Irradiated Mutant Hide  | 
| 4 <br> (Metal) | Thrat's Monster Collar  | Thrat's Masterwork Monster Collar   |

#### New Magic Item: Mutagen
*Potion, rare, 400gp*

This crude syringe is filled with a thick green sludge, ready to be injected into those who dare to risk its potent effects.

As a bonus action, you can inject this mutagen into a willing or incapacitated creature, which gains one of the following random effects, determined by rolling a d4; these effects can stack if multiple doses are administered, and each lasts for 1 minute:

##### Mutagen Effect
| d4  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------:|
 |  1  | ***Rapid Healing.***  The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. Additionally, it has advantage on Constitution saving throws. |
 |  2  | ***Rapid Grow.***  The creature becomes one size larger. If there isn’t enough space to grow, its size doesn't change. While one size larger, it has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and its attacks with weapons or unarmed strikes deal an extra 7 (2d6) damage.|
 |  3  | ***Rapid Acceleration.*** The creature's speed increases by 30 feet, and its movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. It also has advantage on Dexterity checks and Dexterity saving throws. |
|  4  | ***Rapid Degeneration.*** At the end of each of its turns, the creature takes 10 (3d6) force damage and must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If the creature dies from this effect, it explodes, and each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. |
