## Ratfolk Packmasters

Though the many giant rats and other rat  monstrosities lurking beneath the world's surface can be devastating weapons when  unleashed upon one's enemies, few <br> possess the capabilities to control them reliably <br> enough to do so. Ratfolk have a special affinity for <br> such creatures, and ratfolk packmasters are experts <br> at controlling these monsters and goading them into <br> battle. Packmasters utilize whips to keep their <br> bestial charges in line and to use as a weapon <br> when necessary. With each snap of the whip, <br> their war beasts are driven to heightened <br> levels of aggression. 

Packmasters also use wicked weapons <br> known as things-catchers, which, as the name <br> implies, they use to catch things. These <br> two-handed polearms have a large, tong-like <br> head with the inside of their grips lined with <br> spikes. Packmasters can use these weapons to <br> painfully capture and control creatures at a <br> distance, whether it's a new beast to train or <br> an enemy for their beasts to tear apart.

### Packlords
Packlords are the elite commanders among ratfolk, overseeing vast legions of monstrosities with unmatched authority and skill. These formidable leaders distinguish themselves not only in their ability to command large, diverse armies but also in their exceptional talent for creating monstrous creatures. Through dark alchemy and arcane experimentation, packlords engineer new forms of life, blending traits from various beasts to craft unique and terrifying war creatures tailored for battle.

In addition to their roles as master breeders, packlords are also adept in personal combat and employ advanced tactical maneuvers on the battlefield. During battles, packlords administer these concoctions to their creatures, inducing random, powerful mutations that can dramatically alter the course of combat. These mutations might enhance a beast’s healing factor, increase its size, or speed, or even cause it to violently explode, making each encounter with a packlord's army unpredictable and dangerous.

### Gnawfang
Gnawfang's tale is one of survival against the odds, rising from the runt of the litter to become one of the most revered packmasters among the ratfolk. Born significantly smaller and weaker than his siblings, Gnawfang's early life was marked by the looming shadow of death. However, his cunning and resilience allowed him to form an unlikely alliance with swarms of rats and giant rats that roamed the underground warrens. These verminous creatures became his first command, devouring any threats to his survival and solidifying his place within the colony.

Gnawfang's unique bond with these creatures was soon recognized by the elder ratfolk, who trained him in the arts of a packmaster. Unlike his peers, Gnawfang possessed an almost supernatural ability to communicate with and direct the verminous beasts under his control. He knew exactly when to apply the lash and bend creatures to his will to the point that the creatures seemed to understand and anticipate his needs intuitively. They obeyed his commands with such loyalty that they would protect him at all costs, often sacrificing themselves to ensure his safety.

As Gnawfang has grown into his role, his tactical prowess on the battlefield has become legendary. He has mastered the art of maneuvering his beasts in combat, using them not just as blunt instruments of war but as strategic assets. He can orchestrate complex attacks that bewilder his enemies, turning what seem like chaotic swarms into well-coordinated assaults. Under his command, his creatures flank enemies, cut off retreats, and create openings for devastating strikes.

Gnawfang's reputation as a master strategist continues to grow as he leads numerous successful campaigns against those who threaten ratfolk territories. His ability to wield verminous monstrosities as extensions of his own makes him a figure of both awe and fear.

### Ratfolk Packmasters Tactics
&emsp;**Positioning.** Pack masters are frontline commanders who lead beasts and monstrous creatures into battle, maintaining close proximity to activate their Pack Leader trait. They use their pets strategically to form a barrier between themselves and the enemy, ensuring they can command from a position of relative safety.

**Combat Style.** Pack masters employ reach weapons to keep enemies at a distance, making use of their Pack Tactics to gain advantages on attacks and ensuring they can strike effectively while minimizing personal risk.

**Things Catcher.** This weapon allows pack masters to disrupt enemy formations by pulling foes away from their allies, and then directing their minions to surround and isolate the target, effectively cutting them off from support.

**Whip.** The whip is primarily a tool for controlling their beasts, and pack masters can use it to direct and organize their creatures during combat. However, the beasts themselves are typically relied upon for dealing damage.

**Retreat.** Pack Masters are known for their cautious approach in combat, quickly using their Scurry Away ability to retreat behind the safety of their beasts if threatened. If no beasts are available, they will attempt to flee the battlefield to avoid direct confrontation.

#### Packlord Tactics
Packlords mostly use the same tactics as packmasters, with the primary difference being their mutagens.

**Mutagen Use.** Packlords enhance their battlefield capabilities by using Mutagens on themselves and their minions. They typically prioritize their most powerful minion for mutagen injections to maximize combat effectiveness, resorting to self-injection only when extremely vulnerable or cornered due to the risk of adverse effects.

#### Gnawfang Tactics
&emsp;**Minion Creation.** Gnawfang excels at pairing with large monstrosities and can generate rat swarm minions, which can be useful when he's in dire circumstances.

**Combat Objectives.** Gnawfang aims to dominate the battlefield by focusing attacks on less agile enemies. He uses his Command bonus action and Maneuver legendary action to coordinate uses of his Overwhelming Strikes legendary actions.

### Ratfolk Packmasters Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby.
