>
> ### Bonus Action
> ***Cunning Action.*** The ratfolk takes the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.
>
> ***Invoke Duplicity.***  The ratfolk magically creates a perfect illusory copy of itself in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it. The illusion lasts for 1 minute or until the ratfolk dismisses it as a bonus action or the ratfolk is incapacitated.
>
> Once on the ratfolk's turn or when it uses its Scurry Away feature, it can move the illusion up to 60 feet as long it can see the illusion (no action required).
>
> A creature can use an action to examine the illusion, making a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the target ignores all effects of the illusion. Hitting the illusion with an attack (AC 15) or targeting it with an effect that only targets it will also reveal it is an illusion. 
>
> When both ratfolk and its illusion are within 10 feet of a creature that can see the illusion and is unaware it is an illusion, the ratfolk has advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
>
> ### Reactions
