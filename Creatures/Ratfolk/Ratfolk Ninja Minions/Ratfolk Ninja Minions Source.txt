## Death Runner

These ratfolk are the elite minions of their clans. Death runners either lead squads of gutter runners or form squads of their own when faced with situations that require the best of the best their clan has to offer. They utilize the same tactics as their gutter runner subordinates, but with a near-supernatural level of mastery. Death runners are often sent deep into enemy territory on what would be suicide missions for any other ratfolk. Here they eliminate high-value targets, steal the most precious of information, and unleash any other forms of mayhem their masters desire. Most importantly, death runners perform these tasks without leaving any trace of their presence. 

Death runners are also privy to some of the finest equipment their clans have to offer. They wield deadly blades dripping with poisons that can rapidly subdue even the hardiest of foes. Victims who are repeatedly subjected to their attacks find the toxins to become progressively more devastating, and death runners are brutally relentless when assaulting high-priority targets.

## Death Runner of Renown
These ratfolk are members of some of the most notorious death runner units, often referred to as death squads. These renowned death runners often wear uniforms with distinctive colors and patterns to signify their elite membership. These uniforms also usually pay homage to a particularly well-known master from their clan’s history who may have even been the original founder of the death squad.

Renowned death runners possess combat skill that surpasses that of “ordinary” death runners, making them the elite amongst an already elite class. Besides having greater skill and dexterity, these death runners have mastered advanced techniques allowing them to mitigate deadly blows from enemies as they retreat from range and prepare counterstrikes. These evasive techniques make them even more difficult foes to pin down and slay, and most who attempt to do so are quickly dispatched by the poison blades of these renowned death runners.

## Gutter Runner

Ratfolk who survive their dangerous apprenticeships as night runners can rise through the ranks of their clan to become deadly gutter runners. These ratfolk serve as special operations forces, carrying out covert missions that require their level of subtlety and skill. Gutter runner missions may include sabotage, espionage, or guerilla warfare. A gutter runner strike is often a prelude to a larger ratfolk attack, as they remove key enemy assets, destroy equipment, and weaken defenses to pave the way for a larger strike force.

When engaged in combat, gutter runners excel in hit-and-run attacks. Their near-supernatural agility allows them to dodge most attacks with ease, negating the need for armor. This lack of armor allows them to move quickly and operate as effective skirmishers. Gutter runners excel at hit-and-run style attacks, utilizing throwing stars to harry their foes before closing in for deadly strikes the moment they see an opening. Enemies find that trying to engage gutter runners directly is like grabbing at smoke, and they never strike the same way twice, constantly leaving opponents disoriented.

### Night Runners
While most ratfolk are known for <br> employing sneaky, underhanded tactics, <br> night runners make a career of it.  These <br> skirmishing soldiers fight in mobile packs <br> that utilize stealth and guerilla tactics to harry <br> their foes.  Once foes look sufficiently weakened <br> and vulnerable, night runners move in for the kill, <br> using a flurry of throwing stars and flashing blades <br> to quickly dispatch their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, night runners serve as light skirmisher infantry who utilize their mobility to harass and disrupt enemies ahead of attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a dangerous task with a low survival rate, ensuring that only the most skilled night runners advance far in their careers.

## Triad

The ninja clans of the ratfolk focus on training skirmishers and covert operatives for special operations and make less use of the traditional soldiers of other clans. Still, there are times when it becomes necessary for these clans to field ratfolk who can operate as battlefield soldiers and engage foes more directly. The largest and most physically imposing of the ninja clans are trained as triads to fulfill this role They combine the martial tactics of their clan with traditional battlefield training to become deadly and evasive light infantry. 

Though triads don’t wear the heavy armor of other soldiers, they possess the natural evasiveness of their clan which helps them avoid harm as they utilize their deadly polearms.  These polearms are tipped with insidious weeping blades which earn their name from the caustic acid that continually drips from their edge. This acid burns through the flesh and armor of their enemies, allowing triads to dispatch even the most formidable and heavily armored of foes.

### Ratfolk Triad of Duplicity

These triads have studied the shadowy magics of their clans to gain supernatural powers of illusion. At a moment’s notice, they can summon illusory doppelgangers of themselves, making them appear to be in two locations at once. Triads of duplicity use these abilities to bewilder foes on the battlefield, appearing to charge from one direction only to pop out and attack from another. 

An entire squad of triads may be made of illusionary decoys, meant to draw enemies into vulnerable positions or trick them into squandering valuable resources attempting to destroy their fake foes. Once their prey has fallen for the ruse, the real triads leap from hiding and make them pay dearly for their mistake.

> A creature can use an action to examine the illusion, making a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the target ignores all effects of the illusion. Hitting the illusion with an attack (AC 15) or targeting it with an effect that only targets it will also reveal it is an illusion.

> When both ratfolk and its illusion are within 10 feet of a creature that can see the illusion and is unaware it is an illusion, the ratfolk has advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.

> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
