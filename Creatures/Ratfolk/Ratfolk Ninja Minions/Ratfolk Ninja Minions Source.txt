## Death Runner

These ratfolk represent the bottom rung of their <br> society. Numerous and expendable, they are <br> responsible for the lowliest and most dangerous <br> tasks, from unskilled labor to grislily test subjects. <br> Their low quality of life and hazardous duties make <br> their lives mercifully short, and most ratfolk slaves accomplish little with the time they have. 



Despite their frail nature and inferior physical <br> abilities, these lowly ratfolk can be quite ferocious <br> when they feel they have the upper hand. They <br> relish the opportunity to be tormenters rather <br> than the tormented and will utilize every <br> underhanded tactic available to them. However, <br> these ratfolk are cowards among a race known <br> for cowardice, and the moment the fight turns <br> against them, they are prone to scurry away. <br> Ratfolk slaves who die a cowardâ€™s death are liable <br> to get one last spiteful bite in as recompense for <br> a short, meaningless life of fear and pain.

### Night Runners
While most ratfolk are known for <br> employing sneaky, underhanded tactics, <br> night runners make a career of it.  These <br> skirmishing soldiers fight in mobile packs <br> that utilize stealth and guerilla tactics to harry <br> their foes.  Once foes look sufficiently weakened <br> and vulnerable, night runners move in for the kill, <br> using a flurry of throwing stars and flashing blades <br> to quickly dispatch their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, night runners serve as light skirmisher infantry who utilize their mobility to harass and disrupt enemies ahead of attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a dangerous task with a low survival rate, ensuring that only the most skilled night runners advance far in their careers.

>
> Once on the ratfolk's turn or when it uses its Scurry Away feature, it can move the illusion up to 60 feet as long it can see the illusion (no action required).
>
> A creature can use an action to examine the illusion, making a DC 13 Intelligence (Investigation) check. If the check succeeds, the target ignores all effects of the illusion. Hitting the illusion with an attack (AC 15) or targeting it with an effect that only targets it will also reveal it is an illusion. 
>
> When both ratfolk and its illusion are within 10 feet of a creature that can see the illusion and is unaware it is an illusion, the ratfolk has advantage on attack rolls against that creature, given how distracting the illusion is to the target.
>
> ### Reactions
