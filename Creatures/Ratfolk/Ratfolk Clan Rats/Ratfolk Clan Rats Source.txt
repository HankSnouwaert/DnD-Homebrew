## Ratfolk Clan Rats

Ratfolk are a prolific, though short-lived, race. They <br> rarely want for numbers, though few of their kind <br> have the opportunity to develop specialized skills. In <br> battle, ratfolk clans leverage the quantity-over-quality approach of their race to field overwhelming numbers <br> of otherwise unremarkable troops. All healthy ratfolk <br> are equipped with basic weapons and armor and <br> given enough rudimentary training to put it to use. <br> These clan rats then utilize their overwhelming <br> mass to break enemy fighters they would otherwise <br> be unable to defeat in a one-on-one fight.

Clan rats are called such because they are most <br> often the core fighting force of a given ratfolk clan. <br> However, clan rat is a broad term, and any healthy <br> but otherwise unremarkable ratfolk with some <br> weapon proficiency and battle gear could be <br> referred to as a clan rat.

### Volcanic Slashers

Some ratfolk clans make their underground homes <br> in volcanic regions. They quickly learn how to utilize <br> their fiery environment to their advantage, burrowing <br> their homes around magma chambers that provide <br> molten rock, useful for defending their lair with lava <br> traps. The magma also proves useful for forging <br> equipment, and ratfolk of these clans learn to imbue <br> all their weapons with fiery properties. 

The warriors of these clans also prove to be much hardier and heat resilient, as those lacking these qualities donâ€™t last long within their volcanic homes. Known as volcanic slashers, these specialty clan rats combine their high fortitude with flaming weapons to burn their way across the battlefield.
