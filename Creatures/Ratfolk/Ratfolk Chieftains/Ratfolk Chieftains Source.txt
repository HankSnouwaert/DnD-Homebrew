## Ratfolk Chieftains
These ratfolk occupy some of the highest positions of authority within their society. Chieftans are accomplished warriors and commanders who often command smaller groups of ratfolk within a clan. They usually answer to a more powerful warlord who may have several chieftains at his command. Though they must obey their commander without question, chieftains usually rule their given domain with absolute authority and are quick to quash any potential usurpers. By the same token, chieftains usually eye the position of warlord with envy, and those who are bold and opportunistic enough will eventually make a bid for greater power. 

In combat, chieftains command other ratfolk much in the same way as their warlord superiors. Their elite training, equipment, and resolve make them difficult to defeat, and their commanding presence keeps other ratfolk from routing as easily. As such, chieftains are often put in command of strike forces charged with dangerous missions that require higher levels of bravery than ratfolk are typically inclined to provide.

> ***Rat Rally.*** The frightened condition caused by the Scurry Away feature ends on each other rat or ratfolk within 120 of the chieftain that can see or hear it, and its actions are no longer restricted to the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide actions on its next turn. The ratfolk chieftain can take this action while it is frightened by the Scurry Away feature. 
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
