>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (3).*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 3 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The ratfolk can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.

> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The ratfolk makes three attacks, it can replace one of it's attack with a Rat Rally.
>
> ***Spike Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage or, if the ratfolk had advantage on the attack roll, 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage.
>
> ***Warlord's Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage.
>
> ***Rat Rally.*** The frightened condition caused by the Scurry Away feature ends on each other rat or ratfolk within 120 of the warlord that can see or hear it, and its actions are no longer restricted to the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide actions on its next turn. Ratfolk Warlord can take this action while it is frightened by the Scurry Away feature. 
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
