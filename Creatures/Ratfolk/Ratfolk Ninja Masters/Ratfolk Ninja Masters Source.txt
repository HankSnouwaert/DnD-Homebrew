> ***Assassinate.*** During its first turn, the ratfolk has advantage on attack rolls against any creature that hasn't taken a turn. Any hit the ratfolk scores against a surprised creature is a critical hit.
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The ratfolk can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Evasion.*** If the ratfolk is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, the ratfolk instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The ratfolk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Nimble Reflexes.*** When a creature 30 feet or more away from the ratfolk that it can see makes a ranged attack against it, if the ratfolk is not grappled, incapacitated, or restrained, the attack is made with disadvantage.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (3).*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 3 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The ratfolk can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.
>
> ***Poisoned Blades.*** At the end of each turn, each creature hit by the ratfolk with a Throwing Star or Shortsword attack that turn must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) poison damage per hit it took that turn, or half as much damage on a successful save.
>
> ***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The ratfolk deals an extra 21 (6d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft. of an ally of the ratfolk that isn't incapacitated and the ratfolk doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.

> ***Unarmed Strike.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one 
target. *Hit:* 7 (1d6 + 4) piercing damage.

> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.*** When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

> ##### Optional Rule: Smoke Bombs
>In place of an attack as part of an Attack action, the ratfolk can throw a smoke grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. The grenade emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area within a 20-foot radius of where it lands. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.
>
> The ratfolk can use its action to throw a smoke grenade while frightened by its Scurry Away feature.
