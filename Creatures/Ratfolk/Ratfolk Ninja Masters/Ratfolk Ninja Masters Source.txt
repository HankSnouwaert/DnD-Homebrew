## Ratfolk Ninja Masters

### Ratfolk Ninja Assassin

Those few ratfolk who manage to ascend through the ranks of their shadowy clan may eventually become dreaded assassins, representing the pinnacle of their deadly art. These dreaded killers carry out the most vital missions of their clan and usually hire their services out to other clans and even non-ratfolk. Assassins usually operate alone, carrying out operations that would be impossible for multiple ratfolk to accomplish. Killing important figures in heavily guarded locations, tracking the whereabouts of elusive individuals, and pilfering priceless information or artifacts are all within the prevue of an assassin. 

<br><br><br><br>

In times of war, assassins will often disguise as rank-and-file ratfolk, joining their kin in battle until they come within range of a high-value target. At that moment, the assassin springs forth dispatching foes with a whirl of poisoned blades, appearing as a blurred shadow as they deal death to their unprepared victims. At other times, assassins are tasked with sneaking behind enemy lines to slay dangerous but fragile targets, such as commanders, spellcasters, or weapon crews. Their speed and agility allow them to perform such strikes and retreat before their enemies can react to the attack.

This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

#### Master Assassins
The most skilled assassins are given the title of Master, and it is said only thirteen such masters exist at any one time. These assassins possess a level of agility that surpasses that of nearly any mortal creature, making it almost impossible to land a meaningful strike on them. And any who attempt to do so will be mercilessly cut down by a flurry of poisoned attacks in the process. 

The skill of these assassins is such that their clan almost never makes their services available to outsiders and they are only assigned the most vital of missions. On the rare occasions that their clan must wage open war, their nimble forces are led by master assassins who are able to expertly direct their clan members and maximize their deadly potential.

### Ratfolk Ninja Sorcerer

These mystics wield shadowy magics designed to aid <br> the warriors of their clan. Ninja sorcerers are quite <br> rare, and they are very secretive about the nature of <br> their magic. How they recruit new members and how <br> their ranks are organized is a mystery even to many <br> with their clans. They rarely consort with those outside <br> the ranks of the ratfolk ninja clans and usually only <br> carry out missions in direct service of their shadowy <br> masters. 

Ninja sorcerers are typically assigned to support larger groups of their clan carrying out covert missions, where <br> their magic can be put to maximum effect. Their spells conjure shadows and illusions to confuse foes and provide cover for their allies. Ninja sorcerers can also enhance the combat ability of their allies, making their already swift <br> and stealthy clan members even faster and stealthier. If enemies attempt to engage them directly, they can quickly throw up smoke and shadow, disappearing out of sight <br> before rallying their allies for a deadly counterstrike.

> ##### Optional Rule: Smoke Bombs
>In place of an attack as part of an Attack action, the ratfolk can throw a smoke grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. The grenade emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area within a 20-foot radius of where it lands. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.
>
> The ratfolk can use its action to throw a smoke grenade while frightened by its Scurry Away feature.

|  3  |A group of **gutter runners** is sneaking through a province’s farmlands, poisoning water supplies and destroying crops to weaken the land in preparation for a larger invasion.     |
|  4  | The players find a hermit soldier living in the wilderness, claiming his old regiment was slain by sneaky rat-soldiers (**gutter runners**) and that they’ve been hunting him ever since.    |
|  5  |The players are pursuing a marauding warchief with a hefty bounty on his head and soon find themselves in a deadly competition for the prize with a squad of **death runners**.  |

|  12  | The players are charged with protecting a supply depot which ends up attacked by a group of **triads of duplicity** who first send an illusionary attack as a fake-out before attacking from a different direction.

## New Spells

#### Black Whirlwind
*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a moth wing)
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:** Druid, Wizard, Warlock
___

You cause a whirlwind of vile smoke and stinging ashes to rush up at a point you choose within range. Each creature in a 20-foot radius of that point must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 necrotic damage and loses any darkvision it has until the end of its next turn. On a successful save,  a creature takes half as much damage and doesn't lose its darkvision.

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 5th level or lower, the spell that created the light is dispelled. The spell also snuffs out any non-magical fire in its area.


***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.

#### Brittle Bones

- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a broken twig)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:** Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Choose a creature that you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become brittle for the duration. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target. Effects and spells that remove the paralyzed condition will remove the brittle condition.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th. The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\columnbreak

The next time the coated object deals piercing or slashing damage to a creature during the spell’s duration, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 poison damage and is poisoned for 1 minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature poisoned this way can repeat the Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher, the poison damage increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
