## Vaskrik, The Exterminator
*Nigh-Unkillable Cybernetically Enhanced Ratfolk Assassin* <br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Individual, Armaments

This murderous oddity stalks the streets of the surface world, consumed by the singular drive of the hunt. Those unfortunate enough to glimpse this creature see a hunched ratfolk figure, its body a fusion of flesh and machinery. Brass prosthetics replace limbs and swaths of skin, while where hands used to be, now monstrous, bladed claws are in their stead. Embedded in its arms are twin firearms, loaded with bullets carved from deadly cursed stone. Most terrifying is the creature’s face: one beady eye is missing, replaced by a glowing red lens fixed within a brass framework. Like a hellish telescope, this strange device extends with a soft hum, locking onto whatever has caught its predatory interest.

This walking phantom was once Vaskrik, a ratfolk assassin of unparalleled skill. His abominable transformation came after a nearly impossible mission to rescue an Eldritch Engineer. Vaskrik succeeded, leaving a trail of blood in his wake, but victory came at a terrible cost. Maimed and clinging to life, he was saved by the very engineer he rescued. The artificer replaced Vaskrik’s failing body parts with sorcerous forged limbs of bone-crushing strength, devices implanted in his shattered skull amplified his already lethal instincts, forging him into something more construct than ratfolk, turning him into a relentless automaton. Now known as the Exterminator among his kind, Vaskrik is barely controlled by his clan. When assigned a target, nothing—neither pain nor fear—can deter him. He will not stop until his quarry is dead.

***Vaskrik’s Core.***
The mechanical workings of Vaskrik’s form are a mystery, even to the cunning engineer who created them. It is said that even if his mortal body is burned or flayed away, his robotic components will persist, lurching forward with an unyielding intent to annihilate.


### Epic Battle: Vaskrik's Core
If you wish to turn Vaskrik into a truly terrifying encounter, you can have his mechanical frame continue to fight even after his flesh is destroyed. 

When Vaskrik dies, even if his body would otherwise be destroyed, his flesh instead sloughs off, leaving behind Vaskrik’s Core in the space he occupied. Vaskrik’s Core retains the same initiative count as Vaskrik. When the core appears, each hostile creature within a 120-foot emanation must make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 18.

*Failure:* The creature is Frightened and can’t cast spells other than cantrips while Frightened this way. It may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

*Failure by 10+:* While Frightened, the creature can’t take reactions and must take the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the core by the safest available route.

Vaskrik and his core combined should be considered a CR 17 encounter.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a Move, an Action, or a Bonus Action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

### Vaskrik's Tactics
&emsp;**Lock-On:** Vaskrik targets an enemy designated for elimination or the one with the lowest Constitution and Strength. He switches targets if another foe significantly hinders access to his chosen target.

**Attacks:** Prefers close-range Rend attacks. Uses Hex Pistol for distant targets to inflict rending wounds and Daze conditions so that they can’t escape, and he can close the distance.

**Uncanny Dodge:** Reserves for evading high-damage attacks such as Sneak Attacks from rogues or smites from paladins. Avoids making opportunity attacks unless against his Locked-On target.

**Sweep Aside:** Pushes away enemies protecting his target or throws a creature at his Locked-On target to knock it Prone.

**Vaskrik’s Core:** Mirrors Vaskrik’s tactics but prioritizes pursuing, Grappling, and crushing the target.

>
