> ***Avoidance.*** If the deathmaster is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The deathmaster can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The deathmaster has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on Smell.
>
> ***Nimble Reflexes.*** When a creature 30 feet or more away from the deathmaster that it can see makes a ranged attack against it, if the deathmaster is not grappled, incapacitated, or restrained, the attack is made with disadvantage.
>
> ***The Cloak of Shadows. (Magic Item)*** If the deathmaster is in darkness while wearing this cloak, it is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in that darkness, is hidden from divination magic, and can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (5).*** The first time each turn that the deathmaster hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 5 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The deathmaster can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.
>
> ***Sneak Attack (1/Turn).*** The deathmaster deals an extra 35 (10d6) damage when it hits a target with a weapon attack and has advantage on the attack roll, or when the target is within 5 ft. of an ally of the deathmaster that isn't incapacitated and the deathmaster doesn't have disadvantage on the attack roll.
>
> ***Unarmored Defense.*** While the deathmaster is wearing no armor and wielding no shield, its AC includes its Wisdom modifier.

If the target is a creature, it is covered in acid until it or a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. At the end of a creature’s turn, if it is covered in acid this way, it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage, and any armor it is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.

> ##### Optional Rule: Smoke Bombs
>In place of an attack as part of an Attack action, the deathmaster can throw a smoke grenade at a point up to 60 feet away. The grenade emits a cloud of smoke that creates a heavily obscured area within a 20-foot radius of where it lands. A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (20 or more miles per hour) disperses it in 1 round.
>
> The deathmaster can use its action to throw a smoke grenade while frightened by its Scurry Away feature.
