## Doom Wheels

In the sprawling laboratories of the ratfolk, technological and magical prowess intertwine in frenetic chaos. Amidst this interplay, one invention stands as a testament to the insanity and genius of the ratfolk engineers - the doom wheel.

The doom wheel is an immense vehicle that looms over the battlefield like a nightmarish mockery of a rat wheel, a testament to the raw and unbridled power the ratfolk engineers can command. An engineer, picked from the most daring (or unhinged) of their kind, steers the doom wheel from a pilot seat within, guiding this deadly contraption with mad glee, careening wildly across the landscape.

The doom wheel’s motion is powered by an army of irradiated rats, feverishly running in unison along the inside of its massive. Dangerous arcane stones built into the machine mutate and transform these rats into tireless, monstrous variants of their kin, their muscles bulging with unnatural strength and their eyes glowing an eerie green. The ceaseless running of these mutant rats drives the huge wheel, causing it to spin with a relentless, unstoppable momentum.

But the arcane stones serve a dual purpose. As the wheel spins, it generates a kind of eldritch energy, harnessed by the embedded stone. The magical mineral, imbued with the raw force of movement, channels this power into devastating blasts of arcane lightning. This energy is unleashed upon the ratfolk’s enemies in brilliant, lethal arcs, turning the doom wheel into a rolling generator of destructive force.

The swarm cannot steer the doom wheel, and if no one uses the Helm’s action before the start of the swarm’s next turn, at the start of the swarm’s next turn, the doom wheel moves its speed forward in a straight line before its speed drops back to 0.

### Warpfire Wheel

Instead of generating devastating arcs of lightning, this doom wheel variant channels its eldritch energy into an infernal pyrotechnic display. At the heart of the wheel, an eldritch furnace glows with an unholy intensity. Fueled by the sheer kinetic force of the running rats, the furnace channels its blazing wrath into gouts of horrifying, green-tinged flame that consumes all in its path. This fire, hotter and more potent than any natural flame, reduces enemies to ash and the battlefield to a scorched wasteland.

However, the warpfire wheel's destructive potential doesn't end there, for it is equipped with a high-pressure sprayer loaded with a sticky, highly flammable oil. At the pilot's command, this oil can be sprayed over adversaries or across the battlefield. Then, with a malicious grin, the engineer ignites the oil-soaked area with the eldritch fire, turning it into a nightmarish sea of flame.

>
> The grease can be removed from a creature if it or another creature within 5 feet uses an action to scrap or wash it off. The doom wheel ignores this difficult terrain; instead, moving 2 feet through the grease costs the doom wheel only 1 foot of movement. Any creature or vehicle other than the doom wheel that enters the area or ends its turn must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
>
> If an attack, spell, or ability that deals fire damage targets something in a grease-covered area or has an area of effect that overlaps with a grease-covered area, any grease in that area is set ablaze; this includes grease that is covering creatures in that area. All other grease-covered areas and grease-covered creatures in contact with an area of burning grease are also immediately set ablaze as the fire spreads across all the grease it comes in contact with.
>
> When a creature moves into or within the area of burning grease or starts its turn in the area, it takes 3 (1d6) fire damage for every 5 feet it travels. A creature that starts its turn covered in burning grease takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.
>
> ***Wheel of Fire.*** Whenever the doom wheel finishes moving at least 10 feet, a 15-foot wide line of fire with a length equal to the distance the doom wheel just moved (maximum 100 feet) erupts from the doom wheel in a direction it's facing. Each creature caught in the area of the fire must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Wheelz of Doom

When the mad ratfolk engineers set their minds to outdo themselves, they do so with a level of fanaticism that defies comprehension. Born of such fervor is the pinnacle of their insane genius, a terrifying machine imbued with unstable destructive power: The Wheelz of Dooom.

The Wheelz of Dooom represents the zenith of ratfolk engineering prowess, an evolved doom wheel that is the ultimate fusion of the most potent arcane technology and the highest-grade parts scavenged, stolen, or "ingeniously acquired” by ratfolk. The structure of the Wheelz of Dooom is reinforced with arcane steel designed to make it hardier and amplify the machine’s unnatural power.

Every nook and cranny of this monolithic machine boasts meticulous attention to detail, from the titanium-bolted joints to the arcane-etched gears. In a significant upgrade from the original doom wheel, the Wheelz of Dooom is equipped with additional lightning generators. These devices, powered by the relentless running of the strongest irradiated rats, generate lightning of a potency unseen in its predecessor. This energy coalesces into brilliant, crackling bolts that can arc between multiple foes, leaving a trail of charred bodies and scorched earth. The spectacle of the Wheelz of Dooom in action is nothing short of a storm let loose on the battlefield.

### Doom Wheel Loot
Because doom wheels are vehicles, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are items they were carrying or materials salvaged from their remains. Most carried valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks or may not require a check to spot at all. Salvaged material can usually be gathered using an Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls) or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Doom Wheel Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
