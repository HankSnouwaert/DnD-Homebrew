## Cretch Cravenhide

Cretch Cravenhide is a notorious ratfolk chieftain renowned for his unparalleled cunning and treachery. In a society already steeped in backstabbing and opportunism, Cretch stands out as a master of survival and deceit. He has risen through the ranks not by brute strength but by outwitting foes, orchestrating betrayals, and turning near-defeat into unexpected victory.

Cretch is lean and scarred, his wiry frame bearing the marks of countless battles and betrayals. His most striking feature is the bleached skull of his predecessor, which he wears as a grim talisman of luck. His movements are quick and unpredictable, and his uncanny ability to evade death—whether by luck or design—has earned him an almost supernatural reputation among allies and foes alike.

In battle, Cretch is a brutal opportunist. Armed with a curved blade and barbed whip, he thrives in chaos, striking when foes are distracted. His survival instincts are legendary, with attacks seemingly missing him by chance, leaving his underlings to bear the brunt of danger. His retinue, the Vermin Raiders, mirrors his tactics, relying on stealth, ambushes, and sabotage to overwhelm enemies before slipping away.

Cretch climbed the ranks of his clan through ruthless ambition, exploiting every opportunity to undermine rivals and eliminate superiors. His most infamous act was assassinating his predecessor, using the resulting chaos to solidify his leadership. Despite being sent on countless suicidal missions, Cretch has always found a way to survive, earning him both fear and grudging respect.

Cretch’s only true loyalty is to himself. He thrives on proving his cunning and escaping death, caring little for the lives of his followers or the long-term well-being of his clan. His ultimate ambition is not conquest but survival and power at any cost, even if it means sacrificing his own kind to secure his position.

Cretch Cravenhide embodies the worst and most dangerous traits of the ratfolk: cunning, treachery, and ruthless self-interest. A survivor above all else, his presence on the battlefield or in the shadows ensures chaos, betrayal, and the promise that Cretch will always find a way to slink away, victorious or not.

* **Ambush:** Cretch ambushes his foes, striking when least expected.
* **Overwhelming Numbers:** He ensures he has a significant numerical advantage before engaging.
* **Favorable Environment:** Cretch exploits areas with plenty of places to hide, using the terrain to his advantage.

### Vermin Raiders

Most elite ratfolk warriors with access to mastercraft armor and weapons gladly equip these heavy armaments despite the cost to their natural stealth. Yet the Vermin Raiders stand apart. Unlike their heavily equipped peers, these select warriors not only retain their ability to ambush but refine it to a deadly art, surpassing even their lighter-armored kin. Striking in coordinated packs, they attack before an enemy has time to mount a defense, cutting down isolated foes by seizing every fleeting opportunity. The Ratfolk chosen for these regiments are cunning and utterly ruthless; only the keenest can hope to survive among them. Indeed, a Vermin Raider is far more likely to be butchered by his own comrades once the dust settles than by any enemy’s blade.



#### Vermin Raider Tactics
Ratfolk Raiders always initiate combat by attempting to ambush isolated targets. Their strategy varies based on the target's combat style:
* **Against Melee Fighters:**
Raiders maintain their distance, avoiding close combat unless absolutely necessary.
* **Against Ranged Attackers:**
They close in to maximize damage with their pike attacks, particularly when other allied ratfolk surround the target, enabling their Overwhelming Mass ability.

This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

### Cretch Cravenhide in Your Adventures
The following tables provide some adventure hooks for incorporating Cretch into your adventures.

##### Cretch Cravenhide Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Hit-and-Run Raiders:** Cretch leads his Vermin Raiders on a campaign of guerrilla attacks against a dwarven outpost. The adventurers must protect the outpost while tracking the elusive chieftain through twisting tunnels and sabotaged routes.|
|  2  | **The Treacherous Ally:** A rival ratfolk clan approaches the players, seeking help in overthrowing Cretch. They promise to guide the party to his lair but warn that he has numerous traps and escape routes. Can the players trust their "allies," or are they walking into another of Cretch’s schemes?  |
|  3  |**The Cursed Skull:** Cretch’s predecessor’s skull—his so-called "good luck charm"—is revealed to be cursed, sowing chaos wherever he travels. A desperate scholar hires the party to retrieve and destroy the artifact. The challenge? Cretch never lets it leave his side.     |
|  4  | **The Fake Siege:** Cretch engineers a fake ratfolk invasion to panic a surface town while his Vermin Raiders loot its valuables unnoticed. The players must uncover the deception and stop the heist before Cretch disappears into the shadows once again.   |

### Cretch Cravenhide Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. 

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the circumstance. In the case of a ninja sorcerer, you may use an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check instead. 


#### Cretch Cravenhide Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
