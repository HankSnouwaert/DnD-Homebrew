## Lord Scraulk
*The Walking Plague* <br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark, Urban; <br> **Treasure:** Individual, Relics

Among the iniquitous prophets who have sallied forth in the name of the Vermin God to spread ruin and pestilence, none are as horrid as Scraulk. He has surpassed all others in the fecund blight he has nurtured. Scraulk’s destiny was sealed when he and his parishioners were stricken by a baleful sickness—one that cast him into a coma and killed the rest.

In his delirious slumber, Scraulk beheld the vile schemes of the Vermin God: a vision of a world where the surface-dwellers had been enfeebled by rampaging plagues, unleashed by the god’s children. Seas of vermin would rise from the earth to overtake the crippled stragglers. So vivid and glorious was this revelation that, upon awakening, Scraulk’s eyes ceased to function—for no other sight was worthy of beholding. In their absence, he was granted a mystic perception—one that allows him to see the ever-present atrophy within all things. This dreadful sense now guides his unholy pilgrimage.

Scraulk travels across the land, clutching a gnarled staff adorned with spiked censers that hang from its end, each one spewing the very essence of rot as they sway. In his other hand, he chants incantations from the moldering pages of the Book of Blight.

As the Prophet of Decay strides across the realm, all manner of illnesses are drawn to him—summoned by his vile hymns to infest his nefarious pilgrimage. These blights grow in number and lethality within their new host, ultimately spreading far beyond the horizon and fulfilling the machinations of the Vermin Lord.

Over a lifespan that has long exceeded that of ordinary ratfolk, Scraulk has gathered a procession of murderous pathogens. They hover over his misshapen form, creating a sickening cloud that only the most devout members of the Church of Decay can withstand. So numerous and deadly is his flock of diseases that entire armies sent to halt Scraulk’s advance have failed—bodies broken by the noxious miasma, forced to kneel before the malicious power of the Vermin God as they are liquefied from within.

Should one manage to brave the horrid aura, they would find the abominable creature at its heart—not a frail husk, but a being made strong by blasphemous vitality, empowered by decades of accumulated maladies. With grotesque strength and unholy resilience, Scraulk delivers the brutal wrath of his unholy master.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Aura of Pestilence.*** Scraulk emits an aura in a 30-foot emanation from himself. Any ranged attacks that don't deal necrotic damage and travel 30 or more feet through the aura have disadvantage. Additionally, Scraulk may have any creature in the emanation (including himself) take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage at the end of its turn.  
>
> ***Corruption.*** Necrotic damage dealt by Scraulk ignores resistance to necrotic damage and treats immunity as resistance. Necrotic damage dealt by Scraulk to creatures also causes the targets to gain an amount of corruption equal to the necrotic damage dealt. Any creature that has more corruption than it has hit points has disadvantage on d20 tests and can't gain advantage on them.
>
> If Scraulk has more corruption than he has hit points, he instead gains advantage on d20 tests and can't gain disadvantage on them.
>
> A creature loses all corruption after 8 hours of not receiving corruption or if the creature receives an effect that removes exhaustion. If a creature regains hit points, it loses an amount of corruption equal to the amount of hit points it regained.
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** Scraulk can move through and stop in a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than he is without squeezing.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** Scraulk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Plague Focus.*** Scraulk can use his Blight Censer as a spellcasting focus.
>
> ***Vile Conviction.*** Scraulk’s concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking necrotic or poison damage.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** Scraulk is a spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:
>
> - **At will:** *chill touch* (4d8), *thaumaturgy*
> - **3rd level (6 slots):** *rancid visitation**, *world sore**
> 
> <Br>***Rod Of Corruption.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. Hit or miss, all creatures within a 15-foot emanation of Scraulk (including Scraulk) take 13 (3d8) necrotic damage.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
> Scraulk gains two additional actions in combat: Blighted Assault and Foul Incantation. He rolls initiative for each of these at the start of combat using his own initiative modifier. On the rolled initiative count (losing ties), Scraulk can take that action if he is not incapacitated. Instead of using either of these actions, he can use Tenacious Will, even if incapacitated.
> 
> **Blighted Assault.** Scraulk can move up to 15 feet. During this movement, Scraulk can make a Rod of Corruption attack.
>
> **Foul Incantation.** Scraulk casts a spell.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If Scraulk is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.
>
> **New spells described at the end of the document.*
> 
> ### Corrupted Burst
> On initiative count 1, Scraulk may choose one creature he is aware of with 30 or more corruption within 60 feet of him, even if he is incapacitated. That creature loses all of its corruption, and each other creature in a 10-foot emanation of the chosen creature must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 18. *Failure:* The target takes 30 necrotic damage. *Success:* Half damage only. *Fails by 10 or more:* The creature is also paralyzed until initiative count 1 of the next round.
>
> If Scraulk is in the emanation, he regains 30 hit points instead.

### Scraulk's Lair

Scraulk's long wanderings mean he claims no place as home. However, the Prophet of Blight may linger in one region for an extended time, allowing the rot that exudes from him to fully permeate the land. Parishes belonging to the Church of Decay may also summon him to festering sanctuaries when in need of his dark power to enact some grand, villainous scheme.

When fighting within his lair, Scraulk's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 1.  

#### Lair Action
When Scraulk rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or Scraulk dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 14 and acts of its own accord, always acting in Scraulk’s best interest. 

While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. When it awakens, it chooses three points on the ground within its boundaries, causing vile rot to ooze out and spread in a 5-foot radius on the ground from each point.

On initiative count 0 (losing ties), each creature standing in one or more pools gains 16 (3d10) Corruption (as described by Skraulk's Corruption trait). Then, for each pool, if no creatures are standing in it, its radius increases by 5 feet. The rot lasts one minute or until Scraulk dies.

\columnbreak

#### Regional Effects

The presence of Scraulk drastically affects his surroundings, causing rot to run rampant and create the following effects everywhere within 10 miles of his lair (the Corruption referred to in these effects is described in Lord Skraulk's Corruption trait):

 - Whenever a creature with the Plague Disciple or Pox-Ridden Lucidity trait scores a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it gains 16 (3d10) Corruption.

-  Any wood in the area becomes covered in a thin coating of mold. Any creature without the Plague Disciple or Pox-Ridden Lucidity trait that touches this mold gains 16 (3d10) Corruption. The creature cannot gain Corruption again in this way for the next minute.

-  Whenever a creature without the Plague Disciple or Pox-Ridden Lucidity trait spends an hour in the area, it gains 16 (3d10) Corruption.

### Epic Battle: Unholy Resilience
For a mythic encounter with Scraulk increase his hit points to 466. His Challenge Rating (CR) increases to 20.

### Scraulk's Tactics
Scraulk’s primary goal during combat is to spread corruption to as many targets as possible. He focuses on the enemy with the lowest hit points, aiming to increase their corruption level beyond their remaining health

**Rod of Corruption.**
This is Scraulk’s primary form of attack. It's always used against the largest group of enemies.

**Rancid Visitation:** Cast if Scraulk is not already concentrating on another spell, targeting a creature with low Constitution.

**World Sore.** Cast at the center of an enemy group or used to deter movement. On subsequent turns, he detonates the sore if it can affect two or more targets.

**Corrupted Burst.**
Scraulk targets any creature within range, prioritizing blasts that will affect two or more enemies. If he must choose between two creatures, he favors the one whose corruption level is not high enough to impose disadvantage on the DC 20 test.



#### Scraulk’s Lair
Scraulk strategically positions the three oozing puddles within his lair, spreading them out evenly to make it difficult for intruders to stand on them and keep them from spreading. He may also cast World Sore, placing the boil near the puddles to further discourage creatures from approaching or lingering in those areas.

### Scraulk's Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying which materials they're carrying that have functional value.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the

##### Lord Scraulk Loot (Avg. 2,100gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Items (500gp) |
|  10-11 | 1 1,000gp Item (1,000gp) | 
|  12-17 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items (2,000gp) |  
|  18-23 | 1d6(3) 1,000gp Items (3,000gp)  |  
|  24+ |  1d4(2) 2,000gp Items (4,000gp) |  



\columnbreak

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 1,000gp Bone item from a Scraulk could be Scraulk's Bone Idol, a 500gp version might be a Scraulk's Cracked Bone Idol, and a 2,000gp version could be a Scraulk's Pristine Bone Idol.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.



##### Scraulk Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Scraulk's Bone Idol (Cracked/Prsitine) | 
| 2   | Cloth | Scraulk's Robes (Tattered/Masterwork)|  
| 3   | Gem |  Scraulk's Pendant (Chipped/Pristine) |  
| 4  | Metal |Scraulk's Armement Scraps (Damaged/Masterwork) | 

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The **Magic Theme** column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the **Example Descriptor** suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Fiendish loot could be used to craft items that inflict necrotic effects or spread disease, while Chaotic effects could cause madness or mutation.

 
***Random Magic Ingredients.***
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Scraulk Magic Themes 
**Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot: 80%**
|1d4 | Magic Theme | Example Descriptor | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-5 <br>  | Fiendish| Plague-Ridden| 
| 6   | Chaotic  | Warped|  

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.
