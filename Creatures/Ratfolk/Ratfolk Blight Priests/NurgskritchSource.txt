## Arch-Blightlord Nurgskritch
*Supreme Spiritual Ruler of The Church of Decay*<br>
**Habitat:** Jungle, Swamp, Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Relics


Bloated with corruption and wielding the highest authority within the pitiless hierarchy of the Church of Decay, the obdurate Arch-Plaguelord Nurgskritch stands as a festering beacon of pestilence. Both his mind and body are equally hazardous, for the vile schemes and plagues he has devised have annihilated all who dared oppose his ascension—whether from within the church or beyond. His putrescent body harbors such calamitous pathogens that even his fellow foul priests and bishops find them perilous. His schemes are so insidious that entire kingdoms wither and collapse under the ravages of famine and disease, all without his involvement ever being detected.

Beyond his ruthless efficiency in eliminating his enemies, Nurgskritch's unwavering devotion to decay, combined with his hatred for anything that hinders its progression, fuels his religious tyranny. His fevered fanaticism is so powerful that it instills absolute obedience in his followers, compelling them to carry out his will without question.

Rarely does Nurgskritch engage in battle directly, preferring to let his devoted minions or his own lethal plagues exterminate those who displease him.

However, on the rare occasion that his schemes fail to eliminate a target, the pestilent master takes up his Bubo-ridden blade and bubonic scepter, dealing a wretched end to any nettlesome individuals who have evaded death for too long. When he rides into battle, the Great Lord of Decay towers atop Bubo, his grotesquely overgrown and noisome rat, accompanied by his most trusted attendant, Byle. Byle wields a massive blight censer, swinging it with fevered passion, unleashing clouds of noxious filth upon the battlefield.

All the while, Nurgskritch calls upon the baleful power of the Pestilent God, causing the land itself to bloom with filth. The ground splits open like putrid flesh, releasing waves of tainting slime, massive throbbing boils, and malodorous vermin, all spreading festering death in their wake.

Even if one manages to withstand this nauseating onslaught of devoted minions and conjured plagues, they must then contend with the Unholy Figure himself. Fueled by unnatural strength and righteous indignation, each swing of his blade sinks deep into flesh, turning it to mulch as it cleaves through with rotting power.

### The Nurgskritch's Lair  

Nurgskritch's primary lair lies within the darkest reaches of a plague-ridden jungle, buried beneath its twisted roots, within the crumbling ruins of a once-mighty temple city, built by a race far more ancient than the ratfolk who now infest it. It was within this forsaken place that the Great Church of Decay was first founded by the ratfolk who stumbled upon its desolate remains.
However, Nurgskritch’s insidious designs have led him to construct secret strongholds deep underground in many lands. Wherever these bastions take root, they spread like tumors, seeping illness and corruption into the region.


When fighting within his lair, the Nurgskritch's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 1.  

#### Lair Actions  

When Nurgskritch rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him, and until combat ends or Nurgskritch dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 16 and acts of its own accord, always acting in Nurgskritch’s best interest. While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it.  

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair chooses a point within its boundaries. One of the following substances erupts in a 15-foot cube centered on that point, and creatures within suffer the corresponding effect. The lair cannot use the same substance two rounds in a row:  

- **Soul Feasting Blight.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Charisma saving throw or take 5 necrotic damage. Nurgskritch regains hit points equal to the total damage dealt this way.  

- **Sticky Pus.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Strength saving throw. On a failure, their speed becomes 0 until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

- **Disruptive Fumes.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, they cannot cast spells or maintain concentration until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

- **Slick Slime.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they fall prone and can't stand up until initiative count 20 on the next round.  

- **Sickening Sores.** Creatures must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they must use their next movement to travel away from the point where the effect originated. After doing so, they may take the rest of their turn as normal.  

#### Regional Effects  

The presence of the Nurgskritch drastically affects his surroundings, causing rot to run rampant within 10 miles of his lair:  

- Whenever a creature with the Plague Disciple trait scores a critical hit with a melee weapon or reduces a creature to 0 hit points, it inflicts Nurgskritch’s Fever on the target.  
- Any wood in the area becomes covered in a thin coating of mold. Any creature without the Plague Disciple trait that touches this mold becomes inflicted with Nurgskritch’s Fever. The creature cannot be infected again in this way for the next minute.
- Any food or potions left in the area for more than 24 hours become tainted until removed from the region for the same duration. A creature without the Plague Disciple trait that eats or drinks the tainted substance contracts Nurgskritch’s Fever.  
- Whenever a creature without the Plague Disciple trait finishes a long rest in the area, it contracts Nurgskritch’s Fever.  

These effects gradually dissipate over 1d10 days after Nurgskritch’s death.  



### Nurgskritch's Fever  

Whenever an event causes a creature to contract Nurgskritch’s Fever, it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it becomes infected with the disease at Severity Level 1. If already infected, its Severity Level increases by 1.  

##### Severity Effects  

| Severity Level | Effect |  
|:----:|:---------------------------------------------------|  
| **1** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d4 and subtracts the result. |  
| **2** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the result. |  
| **3** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d8 and subtracts the result. |  
| **4** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d10 and subtracts the result. |  
| **5** | Whenever the infected creature makes a d20 Test, it rolls a d12 and subtracts the result. |  

#### Curing Nurgskritch's Fever  

A creature suffering from Nurgskritch’s Fever can attempt to cure itself through magic or healing abilities:  

- If a creature uses an ability that would end the Poisoned condition, it must first succeed on a DC 19 wisdom check. On a success, the Severity Level decreases by 1.  
- For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, the Severity Level decreases by an additional 1.  
- If the ability used to cure the disease is from a class with the Spellcasting feature, the caster adds their Spell Attack Modifier to the ability check.  
- If the creature is targeted by Heal or Mass Heal, the disease is instantly cured.  

After Nurgskritch’s death, a creature infected with Nurgskritch’s Fever reduces its Severity Level by 1 for each completed long rest.

>
> ***Keen Smell.*** Nurgskritch has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Nurgskritch’s Plague.*** Whenever Nurgskritch casts a spell that deals necrotic damage and forces one or more creatures to make a saving throw, each creature that fails that save becomes infected by Nurgskritch’s Plague for the next minute or until cured.  
> At the end of each of Nurgskritch’s turns, he rolls on the Plague Symptom table (described at the end of this document). Each creature infected by this plague makes a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and has disadvantage on ability checks, saving throws, and attacks using the ability tied to that symptom until the end of Nurgskritch’s next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is no longer infected. If the creature fails by 10 or more, it also suffers the Severe Symptom for that ability until the end of Nurgskritch’s next turn.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass.*** When Nurgskritch hits a creature with an attack, he deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage per ally he has within 5 feet of that target who isn’t incapacitated (up to three allies).
>
> ***Pestilent Blessing.*** When a creature makes a saving throw against a spell cast by Nurgskritch (including on himself), it can choose to fail. If it does so, Nurgskritch can have that creature use its reaction to move up to its speed and make one melee attack with advantage.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Spellcasting.*** Nurgskritch is a spellcaster. His spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). He knows the following spells:
> - **At will:** *chill touch* (4d8), *thaumaturgy*  
> - **2nd level (4 slots):** *stream of corruption**  
> - **3rd level (4 slots):** *world sore**  
> - **4th level (4 slots):** *virulent decay**
>
> <br>***Blade of Nurgskritch.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
> *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage, and the target becomes infected by Nurgskritch’s Plague.
>
> ___
> ### Monstrous Actions
> Nurgskritch gains two additional actions in combat: **Blighted Assault** and **Pestilent Birth**. He rolls initiative for each of these at the start of combat using his own initiative modifier. On the rolled initiative count (losing ties), Nurgskritch can take that action if he is not incapacitated. Instead of using either of these actions, he can use **Tenacious Will**, even if incapacitated.
>
> **Blighted Assault.** Nurgskritch or a creature he is mounted on can move up to 30 feet. During this movement, Nurgskritch can make two *Blade of Nurgskritch* attacks.
>
> **Pestilent Birth.** Nurgskritch creates three **Foul Spawn** (stat block on next page) in unoccupied spaces within 30 feet of him. These **Foul Spawn** remain until destroyed or until Nurgskritch dies. They act on their own turns, immediately after this action’s initiative count. He can have up to three **Foul Spawn** at a time from this feature.
>
> **Tenacious Will.** If Nurgskritch is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.
>
> **New spells described at the end of the document*
>

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> 
> While rampaging, the creature is subject to the following effects:
> 
> - Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
> - On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see within reach. After making its attacks, it can’t move for the rest of its turn.
> - If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it moves toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest available route until it is within range to attack. If it reaches a target, it immediately makes an attack and can’t move for the rest of its turn.
> - If the creature still isn’t within reach of a hostile creature after moving, it must take the Dash action and continue moving toward the nearest hostile creature.
> - The creature can’t cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

> ### Traits
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** Byle can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than him without squeezing.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** Byle has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass.*** When Byle hits a creature with an attack, he deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage per ally he has within 5 feet of that target who isn’t incapacitated (up to three allies).
>
> ***Plague Disciple.*** While Byle is poisoned or diseased, he is rampaging*. Additionally, when he takes necrotic or poison damage, he is also rampaging until the end of his next turn. While rampaging, he cannot use his Scurry Away ability.
>
> ***Scurry Away.*** At the start of his turn, the Byle can choose to become frightened of a creature he can see until the start of his next turn (ignoring immunity to the frightened condition) and move up to half his speed away from that creature without provoking opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, he can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action.

### Nurgskritch's Tactics
Nurgskritch's main goal in combat is to spread his plague to as many targets as possible.

#### Normal Turn Sequence
Nurgskritch casts the following spells in order of priority:

* **Virulent Decay**
    * Cast when it can affect three or more enemies.
    * Upcast to 5th level if it will hit more targets.
    * Can use his own allies to bridge gaps between enemies.<br>
<br>  
* **World Sore**
    * Placed in the center of an enemy group or in key locations to deter movement.
    * Follow-up: Cast Chill Touch, or if the boil can hit four or more enemies, detonate it immediately.
    * On subsequent turns, minions will detonate the boil if it affects two or more targets.<br>
<br>
* **Stream of Corruption**
    * Targets as many creatures as possible.
    * Effective for hitting both enemies and Nurgskritch’s own minions.<br>
    
\columnbreak

* **Blighted Assault**
    * Focuses on infecting as many targets as possible, prioritizing enemies with low AC.<br>
<br>
* **Pestilent Birth**
    * Summons minions next to ranged attackers.
    * Minions stay grouped to benefit from Overwhelming Mass and can be affected by Nurgskritch’s spells.

#### Lair Actions
* Nurgskritch is highly intelligent and wise, allowing him to predict his opponents' weakest saving throws.
* He selects lair actions based on the largest enemy group, choosing a saving throw type they are least likely to succeed against.
* If his plague causes disadvantage on a particular saving throw, he will favor lair actions that exploit this weakness.

#### Allies
**Billios.** Targets large enemy groups to maximize damage.
**Bubo.** Functions as an independent mount for Nurgskritch that attacks targets that will give it the benefits of Overwhelming Mass. Bubo can still move with Nurgskritch when he uses Blighted Assault.

### New Spells

#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___


Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.


#### World Sore
*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You cause a festering boil to grow from a surface in an unoccupied space you can see. The boil is a Medium object, and the surface must be wide enough to accommodate its size. When the spell ends, the boil shrivels and disappears.

The boil has AC 10, 30 hit points, immunity to psychic, poison, and necrotic damage, and vulnerability to piercing and slashing damage. It cannot regain hit points.

When the boil is reduced to 0 hit points, it bursts in a spray of toxic pus, creating a 20-foot-radius emanation centered on it. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. The spell then ends.

At the start of each of your turns, while the spell is active, the boil swells with more pus, the damage it deals increases by 1d12, and it takes 3d6 force damage as it strains under its own pressure.

You can use your action to rupture the boil, reducing it to 0 hit points.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The hit points of the boil are increased by 10, and the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 3.

\columnbreak

#### Virulent Decay
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

You unleash a bolt of decay toward a creature you can see within range, infecting it with necrotic energy. The infection can then spread to another creature of your choice within 5 feet of the first target, and then to another creature within 5 feet of that one. This process repeats one more time. A creature can only be infected once by this spell.

Each infected creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 6d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10, and the infection can jump one additional time for each spell slot level above 4.
