## Ratfolk Blight Monks
*Fanatical Zealots of Disease & Decay*<br>
**Habitat:** Swamp, Underdark, Urban; **Treasure:** Individual, Relics

Soiled and tattered robes drape the emaciated frames of these wretched creatures, their skin riddled with rashes and boils as though rotting from within. Crusted with rust and filth, their weapons seem little more than festering extensions of their own diseased bodies. These are the initiates of the Great Church of Decay, known as Blight Acolytes—the most fanatical servants of the Verminous God of Ruin. Though many ratfolk pay homage to this dark deity, none are more zealous than those within the Church of Decay.

These twisted preachers proclaim disease and pestilence to be gifts from their god—holy instruments of conquest meant to spread ruin and usher in his eternal dominion. Those who join their ranks willingly embrace infection, believing each bout of sickness to be a sacred trial. However, few endure for long; many perish before completing their initiation, and more succumb just days or weeks after ordination.

Yet in the short time they have, these contagion-ridden zealots instill dread wherever they go. Even a narrow victory over them can prove hollow, for the virulent illnesses they carry may linger, claiming victims long after the ratfolk have fallen. Ironically, the very diseases that destroy most creatures only embolden these deranged followers. Their ravaged bodies endure cruel punishment, driven by feverish mania that overrides the ratfolk’s usual urge to flee.

In their most delirious moments, these zealots throw themselves into violent frenzies—frothing at the mouth, swinging their corroded weapons with abandon, and shrieking praises to their noxious god.

***Path to Monkhood.*** Acolytes who survive the Church’s anointing rituals—wherein they are deliberately exposed to a multitude of diseases—ascend to the rank of blight monk, fully inducted into the order. To the Church of Decay, this elevation is an honor of the highest degree, proof that the ratfolk in question is truly chosen by the Verminous God. Blight monks are tasked with both spreading the faith and seeking ever more potent strains of contagion to perfect their vile worship.

No longer mere carriers of disease, blight monks become living vessels of corruption, their bodies swollen with layered infections that would kill any lesser creature. Each new malady intensifies their fevered devotion, granting them a kind of unholy resilience and near-ecstatic delirium. They pour this fervor into recruiting new initiates—often by force—while continuing to spread their god’s plague far beyond the tunnels and warrens of the ratfolk. In their eyes, every fresh outbreak is a grand offering, a testament to the Rat God’s power, and a reminder that all will eventually succumb to the sweet rot of decay.

### Ratfolk Blight Censer Bearers

In reeking corridors and plague-ridden warrens, ragged robes cling to gaunt frames, their frantic eyes shining through noxious fumes. These are the blight censer bearers of the Church of Decay, wielders of heavy, chain-flail censers loaded with rancid incense and toxic powders. Each swing unleashes a choking haze that sears lungs and rots flesh—foe and wielder alike—leaving behind the bitter stench of necrosis.

Chosen from the most zealous initiates, they endure brutal trials of disease and forced inhalation to prove their worth. Survival hinges as much on fanaticism as on fortitude. For them, every hacking cough is an act of devotion. Dying from their own fumes is no tragedy but a sacred martyrdom—an offering to their pestilent god, securing a place of honor among the rotting faithful.

Their mission is brutally simple: slaughter as many heretics as possible before succumbing to their own toxic clouds. Even fellow ratfolk recoil in dread, yet within the Church of Decay, they stand as revered champions. Charging headlong into battle with rattling chains, hacking coughs, and frenzied cries, they spread disease and despair with unhinged glee—sure each ragged breath draws the world one step closer to the triumphant reign of decay. Their feverish resolve knows no bounds; in every spasm of pain and labored gasp, they glimpse the promise of their god’s all-consuming blight.


\columnbreak

<br><br>

***Blight Stokers.*** Most who dare to wield the toxic blight censers quickly perish, their lungs corroded by the very fumes they unleash. Only the hardiest and most devout ratfolk endure this peril, proving their worth through unrelenting faith and sheer physical resilience. Those who survive become blight stokers, revered among the faithful for their singular ability to withstand—and even thrive on—the censer’s noxious output.

It is whispered that their devotion to the Rat God ignites an inner fire so potent that it protects not only themselves but also those who charge into battle at their side. When a blight stoker marches, lesser zealots follow in their wake, shielded by a haze of foul vapors that would otherwise rot flesh on contact. This aura of protection bolsters the Church of Decay’s ranks, forging a fanatical spearhead that can breach fortified positions with lethal efficiency.

In the thick of combat, a blight stoker’s relentless swings conjure swirling clouds of virulent smoke, soaking the battlefield in corrosive fumes that eat away at armor and flesh alike. Their unwavering fervor becomes a rallying beacon for other ratfolk, driving them onward despite the stench of decay. While others choke on toxic air, the blight stokers remain steadfast, confident that their pious suffering will be rewarded when the Rat God’s grand design of rot and ruin finally engulfs the world.

### Zealot of Blight 
Ratfolk chieftains who fully pledge themselves and their clans to the Church of Decay, along with seasoned warriors who claw their way through the church’s treacherous ranks, ascend to the esteemed title of Zealot of Blight. Their authority is second only to the clergy, and they are entrusted with leading crusades in the name of the Rat God.

As champions of pestilence, these zealots wield weapons steeped in the deadliest poxes, their very touch capable of turning flesh to mulch. Their devotion to decay is so intense that it becomes infectious, spreading like a living plague. Those who fall under their influence descend into reckless abandon, casting aside all caution as madness overtakes them.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

 Any campaign led by a Zealot of Blight inevitably becomes a massacre, as  delirium wracked foes are driven into a frenzied charge, only to be cut down by the equally rabid minions of ruin.

So insidious is the zealot’s madness that even in death, its influence lingers and spreads. The moment a zealot of blight falls, their followers seem to inherit their madness, as if a festering contagion from the fallen zealot burrows into their minds. Consumed by newfound fanaticism, they carry on the slaughter. Such is the fecund nature of the Church of Decay.

> ***Aura of Vile Fanaticism.*** During combat, the ratfolk emanates a 10-foot aura that is inactive while it is incapacitated.

On a failure, it takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage and gains advantage on melee weapon attack rolls until the start of its next turn, but attack rolls against it also have advantage.

> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The ratfolk can move through and stop in a space large enough for a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The ratfolk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass.*** When the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage per ally it has within 5 feet of that target who isn’t incapacitated (up to three allies).
>
> ***Plague Disciple.*** While the ratfolk is poisoned or diseased, it is rampaging*. Additionally, when it takes necrotic or poison damage, it is also rampaging until the end of its next turn. While rampaging, it can’t use its Scurry Away ability.
>
> ***Power Grab.*** When the zealot dies, the ratfolk within 60-feet that has the most hit points may end any charmed or frightened conditions affecting it. For the next minute, it gains 15 temporary hit points, is quickened, and gains the Power Grab ability if it does not already have it. If multiple ratfolk are tied for the highest hit points, the closest one is chosen. If multiple are at equal distance, one is chosen randomly.
>
>
> ***Scurry Away.*** At the start of its turn, the ratfolk can choose to become frightened of a creature it can see until the start of its next turn (ignoring immunity to the frightened condition) and move up to half its speed away from that creature without provoking opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, it can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action.

### Lords of Blight
Some ratfolk warlords and ascended blight monks surpass the Zealots of Blight, earning the dreaded rank of Lord of Blight. While Zealots wield pox-laced weapons, these higher masters of ruin possess enough unholy faith and resilience to brandish colossal blight censers—chain-bound orbs spewing corrosive fumes potent enough to scour flesh from bone. 

Their warped bodies bear the marks of countless battles: limbs twisted by pestilence, skin etched with the Rat God’s vile sigils, and eyes burning with feverish conviction. Merely standing in a Lord of Blight’s presence can drive ratfolk hordes into a rabid frenzy, hurling themselves through clouds of necrotic vapor without pause. 

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Under such leadership, campaigns of ruin become an orchestra of choking screams and ragged battle cries, as enemies struggle for air amid the searing haze.

Yet these warlords are far from mindless berserkers. They lead entire warhosts with cold precision, unleashing waves of disease and delirium to cripple the enemy before the final blow. Even in death, their legacy endures—manifesting as a psychic contagion that spurs their followers to a last, frenzied surge of ruin, ensuring no victory is truly safe. Thus, these grim tyrants sit at the Church’s martial pinnacle, driving decay’s relentless advance.

##### Ratfolk Blight Monk Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Quarantined Temple:** A once-peaceful monastery goes silent amid rumors of a deadly outbreak. In truth, blight monks have seized its holy relics to craft a potent contagion. The party must enter the infected halls, halt the plague’s spread, and reclaim the temple before neighboring villages fall victim.  |
|  2  |**The Whispering Windmill:** Farmers claim strange chanting echoes from a desolate windmill at dusk. Investigations reveal a blight monk outpost, using toxic sludge to taint the local aquifer. The heroes must climb the creaking tower, face maddened zealots, and sabotage the machinery before the entire region is poisoned.  |
|  3  | **Nightmare Caravan:** Travelers report a roving caravan of ratfolk wielding massive censers that leave victims bedridden with fever. The party can ambush them on the open road—or cut off their supply lines, forcing the censer bearers to withdraw. Failure means an unchecked plague sweeping across the land.   |
|  4  |  **The Fume-Filled Maze:** Beneath a ruined fortress lies a deadly labyrinth laced with swirling toxins, guarded by blight censer bearers who experiment on captives. The heroes must brave claustrophobic tunnels to free prisoners and dismantle the censer stations.   |
|  5  | **The Tower of Decay:** A Zealot of Blight occupies a remote wizard’s tower, exploiting its resources to forge new plagues. Ratfolk enforcers now patrol corrupted halls, storing arcane toxins in the library. The party must infiltrate, rescue any surviving scholars, and topple the Zealot’s defenses to prevent a catastrophic outbreak.   |
|  6  |  **The Short-Lived Kingpin:** A rogue lord of blight peddles unstable “diluted” plague incense to criminal rings, seeking quick power in the undercity. Each batch risks turning buyers into plague-ridden casualties. The party must infiltrate the black-market network, track down this renegade, and stop an impending epidemic.  |

### Ratfolk Blight Monk Tactics
&emsp;**Blight Acolytes and Monks.** These ratfolk gang up on targets to trigger their Overwhelming Mass ability, swarming their foes. They work best with AoE necrotic or poison damage and thrive in tight spaces, where enemies can’t spread out. They position themselves to prevent foes from escaping but will scurry away and regroup if left without support.

**Censer Bearers and Stokers.** These ratfolk target large enemy groups, maximizing their Plague Disciple effects with their weapons. They trigger their own abilities and can activate the effects of nearby allies, spreading their sickness further.

**Zealots & Lords of Blight** These leaders and their allies only fail their Aura of Vile Fanaticism saving throw if they have not yet activated their Plague Disciple ability or if no enemies have succumbed to the aura. They always seek advantage on attacks.

### Ratfolk Blight Monks Loot
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby.

Finding valuables can be done using an **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check, depending on the

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging
> 
> While rampaging, the creature is subject to the following effects:
> 
> - Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
> - On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action, targeting the nearest hostile creature it can see within reach. After making its attacks, it can’t move for the rest of its turn.
> - If no hostile creatures are within range of any of the creature’s attacks, it moves toward the closest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest available route until it is within range to attack. If it reaches a target, it immediately makes an attack and can’t move for the rest of its turn.
> - If the creature still isn’t within reach of a hostile creature after moving, it must take the Dash action and continue moving toward the nearest hostile creature.
> - The creature can’t cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.
