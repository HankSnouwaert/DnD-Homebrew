## Ratfolk Storm Vermin


These ratfolk soldiers are the most massive and elite of their kind. Future storm vermin are identified at a young age by their clan as their size, aggressiveness, and dark fur easily distinguish them from the rest of their litter. They are then raised via brutal training regiments designed to shape them into elite warriors. Packs of storm vermin are given the best equipment in the clan and go on to serve as heavy infantry and personal retinues for powerful ratfolk commanders.

>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

In combat, storm vermin are less prone to the cowardice of most rat folk soldiers. Their higher resolve and heavy armor allow them to hold the line against enemy combatants, and their size, training, and deadly weaponry allow them to cut a swath through most ordinary soldiers. Thus, storm vermin are often charged with protecting critical locations and individuals or leading rallying charges against particularly imposing foes.

### Council Guard
These albino storm vermin are the most elite bodyguards in the ratfolks' under-empire. Though their origin is unknown, the council guard serve the most elite members of ratfolk society with an unquestioning loyalty almost alien to most ratfolk. No amount of bribery or coercion can shake a guard member's loyalty. They are even mute, thus preventing them from accidentally spilling any of their master's secrets.

<br>
In combat, these hulking warriors fight with many times the ferocity of an ordinary storm vermin. Their implacable natures mean they will fight to the death if necessary, and no amount of magic can charm or frighten them into submission.
