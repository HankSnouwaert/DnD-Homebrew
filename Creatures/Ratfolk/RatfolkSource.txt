# Ratfolk

## Grey Seer

These eldritch ratfolk are born with grey or <br> white fur and small horns that set them apart <br> from their kin and mark them for a path of <br> arcane greatness. They are trained to be grey <br> seers, the spiritual leaders of ratfolk society <br> who serve as messengers for their verminous <br> god. This position of divine authority allows <br> grey seers to remain somewhat above the <br> petty machinations and power plays of other <br> ratfolk, and even powerful warlords are weary <br> of incurring the ire of a grey seer and, by proxy, <br> its rat god.

 The favor of the rat god is made <br> evident through the grey seer's devastating <br> magical abilities. Using their ruinous magic, <br> these ratfolk can conjure blasts of elemental <br> magic, summon massive rat tides, or drive <br> their allies into self-destructive battle frenzies. <br> They are also notoriously difficult to pin down <br> in combat, able to scurry just out of reach before <br> unleashing their destructive magic. The <br> protection of the rat god is ever-present, and <br> even those able to make seemingly accurate <br> attacks against a grey seer will often find their <br> strikes suddenly veer off course, or their spells <br> lose potency just as they reach their target.

___

You send a creature into a frenzy that pushes its body beyond its limits. Choose a willing creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, it takes 1d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and has advantage on weapon and unarmed strike attack rolls until that turn ends. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt out from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long.  The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep.  If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure.  Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side it moves to. 

The fissure deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with it when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the length by 20 feet and its depth by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

## Night Runners
While most ratfolk are known for <br> employing sneaky, underhanded <br>  tactics, night runners make a career of <br> it.  These skirmishing soldiers fight in <br>  mobile packs that utilize stealth and <br> guerilla tactics to harry their foes.  Once <br> foes look sufficiently weakened and <br> vulnerable, night runners move in for <br> the kill, using a flurry of throwing stars <br> and flashing blades to quickly dispatch <br> their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, <br> night runners serve as light skirmisher <br> infantry who utilize their mobility to <br> harass and disrupt enemies ahead of <br> attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a <br> dangerous task with a low survival rate, <br> ensuring that only the most skilled night <br> runners advance far in their careers.

## Packmasters

Though the many giant rats and other rat <br> monstrosities lurking beneath the world's <br> surface can be devastating weapons when <br> unleashed upon one's enemies, few possess <br> the capabilities to control them reliably <br> enough to do so. Ratfolk have a special <br> affinity for such creatures, and ratfolk <br> packmasters are experts at controlling these <br> monsters and goading them into battle. <br> Packmasters utilize whips to keep their <br> bestial charges in line and to use as a weapon <br> when necessary. With each snap of the whip, <br> their war beasts are driven to heightened <br> levels of aggression. 

Packmasters also use wicked weapons <br> known as things-catchers, which, as the name <br> implies, they use to catch things. These <br> two-handed polearms have a large, tong-like <br> head with the inside of their grips lined with <br> spikes. Packmasters can use these weapons to <br> painfully capture and control creatures at a <br> distance, whether it's a new beast to train or <br> an enemy for their beasts to tear apart.

## Poisoned-Wind <br> Globadiers

This insidious ratfolk infantry specializes in the <br> use of poisoned wind globes. These glass orbs <br> unleash clouds of toxic gas when they shatter, <br> overwhelming groups of foes with choking fumes. <br> A squad of these ratfolk can bring down entire <br> enemy formations with poison gas, and they are <br> especially adept at fumigating foes trapped in <br> enclosed spaces. As such, poisoned-wind <br> globadiers are often used to deal with enemies <br> bunkered within rooms or enclosed fortifications.

Poisoned-wind globadiers wear heavy robes <br> and gas masks made to protect them from their <br> poisons, though in combat, this gear can be <br> damaged, leaving them vulnerable to their own <br> gases. This, combined with the fragility of the <br> poisoned wind globes they carry, makes heavy <br> combat hazardous for these ratfolk, and many a <br> globadier has died to the same gases that slew its <br> foes. As such, most globadiers stay out of the fray, <br> dropping poisoned globes in the path of  pursuers.

## Vermin Lords
These demonic rat beings serve as the avatars of their verminous demon lord. They tower above mortals, their twisted forms a mixture of rat, human, and fiendish features. Their heads are topped with mighty horns, and the flesh peels away from their rat-like skulls, revealing bone etched with demonic sigils. Their long, muscular limbs can wield massive weaponry, yet they are dexterous and nimble with their movements, able to dash across the battle and swiftly dismember foes in the blink of an eye. When not taking action, vermin lords are intensely twitchy and prone to pacing about with a rat-like restlessness. 

Mortal ratfolk regard vermin lords with a mixture of fear and reverence. They only summon these terrifying demons in the most significant of situations, such as when the machinations of their demon lord are in play. Vermin lords always hold the highest position of authority amongst ratfolk, who show them grudging subservience. As instruments of their demon lord’s will, they serve to guide his mortal pawns and ensure his schemes come to pass.

Vermin lords come in different variants, and the type of demon to step into the mortal world depends on its summoners and the needs of its verminous demon lord.


## Vermin Lord Corrupter

Vermin Lord Corrupter
These pestilent demons represent the virulent diseases unleashed into the world by their demonic rat lord. They are magical maladies shaped into a fiendish rat form, and where ever they roam, they leave plagues in their wake. They are most often summoned by those ratfolk who revel in disease and spreading sickness, and these vermin lords consider it their sacred duty to spread their master’s diseases across the mortal realm.

In combat, vermin lord corrupters unleash a slew of pestilent magics capable of rotting away most foes before they can even reach the demon. Those who attempt to engage it in melee combat will find themselves assaulted by waves of biting parasites whittling away their vitality. The vermin lord will then summon a pair of sickle blades to quickly dispatch its weakened and rotting enemies in short order.

### Vermin Lord Deceiver
These devious demons represent their demonic rat lord's cunning and duplicitous nature. They are shadowy fiends whose size and power belies the stealth and subtlety with which they can move and act, always lurking out of sight until an opportunity presents itself. Vermin lord deceivers are summoned when subtlety and guile are needed rather than conspicuous displays of force, and these cunning fiends manipulate enemy and ally alike to facilitate the schemes of their demon lord. They are most commonly served by assassin clans of ratfolk, and are supreme assassins themselves, able to stalk and slay even the most formidable and well-guarded of targets before disappearing into the shadows.

<br><br>

In combat, vermin lord deceivers utilize stealth and misdirection to attack from unexpected directions and prevent enemies from surrounding them. They prefer to attack from a distance, utilizing a massive throwing star capable of cutting a swath through armored soldiers before flying back into the demon’s claws. When engaging in melee combat, the vermin lord utilizes its deadly warpstiletto, a massive dagger the length of a man and capable of piercing through shield and armor alike.

### Vermin Lord Warbringer

These brutal demons represent their demonic rat lord’s arrogance and ferocity. They are the most common and most warlike of the vermin lords. Their awe-inspiring presence rallies the normally cowardly ratfolk and drives them into battle with bloody-minded ferocity. Warbringers revel in their effect on others, making dramatic entrances whenever possible and striking majestic poses before their followers. 

In battle, vermin lord warbringers will often initially lead from the back, driving their minions into the fray. When it comes time for them to join combat, they wield mighty war glaives capable of cleaving through swaths of enemy soldiers. Should the vermin lord fight a powerful foe, they will utilize a brutal spike-fist capable of inflicting horrendous wounds. These weapons are also useful for delivering underhanded strikes against already overwhelmed enemies. Regardless of the circumstances, whenever a warbringer slays a foe, it is always sure to do it in the most dramatic and gory way possible, leaving minions struck with awe and foes struck with terror.

### Vermin Lord Warpseer

These scheming demons represent their demonic rat lord’s plotting and manipulative nature. While all vermin lords scheme, warpseers carry out plots within plots within plots. All their actions serve to advance the inscrutable and long reaching schemes of their verminous master, and the world’s mortals are simply the tools through which they achieve their ends. They are most often summoned by other so-called “masterminds” among the ratfolk who serve the demonic rat god and require aid in carrying out his schemes.

Warpseers are aided in their plotting by the scryorbs they carry. These large crystal balls enable them to peer into a myriad of different futures and determine how each potential action can further their schemes. 

<br><br>

In dire circumstances, the warpseer can shatter the scryorb, unleashing all its mind-shattering knowledge at once. Creatures caught in its proximity will have their psyches torn apart as they are overwhelmed by the near-infinite possibilities they are suddenly exposed to.

However, these mighty fiends are rarely pushed to use such measures, for they wield arcane power beyond even their other vermin lord kin. While all vermin lords can channel magic, warpseers alone are capable of calling down bolts of arching lightning, hurling balls of fire, and unleashing earthquakes capable of leveling settlements.

> ***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The verminlord has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
>
> ***Scry-orb.*** The verminlord can perform a 1-hour ceremony to create a scry-orb from nothingness. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and any previous scry-orb is destroyed if it still exists. The scry-orb vanishes when the verminlord dies. The scry-orb is a magic item, and while the verminlord holds it, it is under the effects of the *foresight* spell. The scry-orb can be attacked while the verminlord is holding it. It has AC 16 and 80 hit points and is immune to poison and psychic damage. Attacks against it have disadvantage if they are made from more than 5 feet away.

All clouds disappear when the spell ends.

>
> **Shatter Scry-orb.** The verminlord throws its scry-orb at a point within 60 feet of it, causing it to shatter and unleash horrifying visions.

## Ratfolk Warlords

Though ratfolk aren’t known for their valor or <br> powers of leadership, those that rise to the top <br> of their martial hierarchy possess an <br> underhanded ferocity that can’t be denied. <br> These warlords combine martial skill, devious <br> tactics, and the ability to rally their otherwise <br> cowardly kin, making them foes that are <br> underestimated all too often. Even when a <br> ratfolk force appears to be routing, one <br> rallying cry from their warlord can turn them <br> from a fleeing army to one that’s quickly <br> overwhelming their overconfident enemies. 

When engaging enemies, ratfolk warlords <br> can utilize an array of weaponry, though brutal <br> spike fists are among their most favored tools. <br> They never fight fair and often use feinting <br> tactics, fleeing from  enemies who appear to have <br> a strong position and striking back at them the <br> moment they show weakness. These strategies <br> also serve to distract and draw out their foes, <br> allowing their minions to surround and swarm <br> the now vulnerable targets.

> ***Warlord's Blade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Rat Rally.*** The frightened condition caused by the Scurry Away feature ends on each other rat or ratfolk within 120 of the warlord that can see or hear it, and its actions are no longer restricted to the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide actions on its next turn. Ratfolk Warlord can take this action while it is frightened by the Scurry Away feature. 
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
