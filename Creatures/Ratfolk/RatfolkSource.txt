# Ratfolk Creature Guide
This document contains a collection of resources to help you run adventures heavily featuring ratfolk. Ratfolk forces come in many shapes and sizes, but this guide will focus on what is common to most ratfolk, with a focus on ratfolk soldiers and grey seers. These resources are divided into Encounter Guides, Loot Guides, and Example Encounters. Encounter Guides will help you understand the mindset, motivations, and tactics of the creatures, so you have a better idea of how to play them. Loot Guides provide alternate ways to provide treasure found after defeating these enemies. Example Encounters will provide encounter scenarios involving these creatures and instructions on how to run them.

## Encounter Guides
These guides explore the motivations and tactics of specific creatures to help provide richer roleplaying experiences when using them. Motivations determine the priorities the creature has and what goals it is likely to form based on them. Tactics determine the means through which the creature is most likely to achieve those goals. Motivations and tactics apply when roleplaying wild beasts looking for their next meal, as well as major characters serving as antagonists for an entire campaign.

### Motivations

Understanding a creature's motivations will help you give it goals that may put it into direct conflict with the players. If players can decern that a creature has goals that aren't just "be an enemy for the players to defeat," it will breathe more life into the world and give the players a chance to make more informed decisions as to how to deal with the creature. 

This section of the guide will provide examples of common motivations for these types of creatures in general and specialized motivations for more unique creatures.


### Tactics

Understanding a creature's preferred tactics will help you form a strategy for how the creature will attempt to achieve its goals and guide you in making the most of the creature's abilities. Players who can recognize a creature's tactics will then have a chance to make note of them and attempt to adjust their own tactics accordingly.

This section of the guide will provide examples of how the creatures prefer to initiate combat, what tactics they use during combat, and what they will do if they are losing.

## Loot Guides

The DMG contains Individual Treasure tables listing the number of coins that can be dropped by creatures of different CRs. However, many creatures have no reason to carry coins or even have them within their vicinity. Other creatures may carry wealth in the form of items whose value isn't apparent at first glance. 


And sometimes, items are hidden away in nearby areas that are difficult to spot. How different CRs are split among the tables also results in creatures of wildly different power levels dropping the same amounts of wealth.

You can use these loot guides if you wish to provide your players with alternate sources of wealth when they slay monsters that don't carry money, let players use their skills to collect wealth, or just provide treasure that scales more closely with creature CR.

The guides provide rules for allowing players to loot valuable goods from their foes' corpses or the surrounding area after an encounter. This looting can be done using a skill check made by one of the players, with the type of check required dependent on the type of item the player wishes to collect and how the item is being collected. The more successful the check, the more goods the player is able to collect. 

> ##### What’s Alternate Loot Good For?
>Treasure other than coins, gems, and art objects can be used to provide forms of wealth that better fit the context of the current environment. Players with the right skill sets might also be able to use valuables they find this way to craft useful items. These could be handy mundane items or even magic items. Hide and bone could be crafted into weapons and armor, while potent plants or liquids could form the base for a potion.

## Ratfolk Encounter Guide

The nature of ratfolk and the names they go by varies from setting to setting. However, adventures that pit players against evil ratfolk usually feature them as unscrupulous and underhanded adversaries who utilize stealth and overwhelming numbers to compensate for other shortcomings. Ratfolk often dwell in formerly abandoned towns or the sewers of cities occupied by other humanoids. They may also construct their own hidden settlements underground or within deadly swamps. From these dwellings, they can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive.  

Players may come into conflict with ratfolk who are launching an attack on other humanoids, or they might stumble across ratfolk lairs in the wild or while exploring urban ruins. The most common types of ratfolk players are likely to encounter are foot soldiers, who range from lowly slaves to mighty warlords leading entire clans. Some ratfolk forces may also include a grey seer who serves as a powerful mystic and spiritual leader for the clan.


### Ratfolk Motivations
Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. Many carry an everpresent sense of fear and inferiority and thus grab at power as a means of mitigating these insecurities. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk with specialized skills will seek mastery in that skill as a means of elevating themselves while also seeking to sabotage any rivals. 

\columnbreak

Lowly ratfolk slaves will leap at any chance to bully another creature, and ratfolk warlords seek to expand the size of their territory and clan. All ratfolk take particular glee in seeing the works of rival races reduced to ruin and will bring about such ruin for its own sake as it facilitates a sense of superiority amongs their kind.



Ratfolk with more mystical inclinations, such as grey seers, may appear to give up this selfish drive in service of their divine calling, but they, too, seek power. Their service is merely a means of gaining access to eldritch powers, which they can use to elevate themselves amongst their clan, and they often walk the fine line between doing what their divine masters require of them and utilizing their gifts to achieve their selfish ends.



#### General Ratfolk Motivations
* Securing resources or territory for a clan
* Bringing ruin upon a feared enemy
* Acquiring items that enhance the ratfolk’s power or can serve as a status symbol
* Increasing status among the clan
* Avoiding the wrath of higher-ranking clan members


#### Grey Seer Motivations
* Serving the will of an otherworldly master
* Securing eldritch lore or powerful magic items
* Gaining influence over other clans

### Ratfolk Tactics
Ratfolk rarely have the advantage over their foes in terms of individual power and must instead rely upon cunning and numbers. Grand strategic goals are pursued using deception, betrayal, and securing large numbers of allies. Ratfolk are opportunistic schemers by nature and can flip from cowering hesitation to brutal aggression the moment they see an opening to pursue their goals. Though ratfolk are quick to backstab one another to pursue their ends, they naturally unite into overwhelming verminous mobs when faced with an outside threat. These tactics carry over into how ratfolk engage the players in combat.




#### Engagement
Ratfolk rarely engage enemies on anything approaching even footing. They don’t start a fight unless they’ve caught the players off-guard, have overwhelming numbers, or have a terrain advantage. If they’re able, ratfolk will surround the players before making their presence known using their natural stealthiness. They will also try to fight in dark and claustrophobic environments where their darkvision and Crevice Crawler abilities allow them to sneak up from unexpected directions.


#### Combat

So long as they believe they have the upper hand, ratfolk are vicious combatants to the point of recklessness. They will dogpile an isolated or otherwise vulnerable opponent and utilize their Overwhelming Mass feature to rack up brutal amounts of damage. If the players manage to regroup to support whoever is being ganged up on, the ratfolk will scatter using their Scurry Away feature before rallying to reattempt the same tactic. Fighting in an environment with tight spaces the players can’t easily move through helps facilitate this fighting style.

\columnbreak

#### Retreat
Ratfolk aren’t shy about retreating if a fight doesn’t appear to be going well. If ratfolk force as a whole is doing well, individual ratfolk will often fight to the death. However, their morale plummets once they no longer perceive themselves as having the upper hand. This may happen if the ratfolk lose more than half their fighting force or their leader is slain, and their enemies don’t appear to be near defeat. Under these circumstances, most ratfolk will flee if they have lost at least half their health, face a foe they don’t outnumber, or see multiple nearby allies flee.


#### Tactics: Ratfolk Slaves
These wretches are generally used as cannon fodder by other ratfolk. They often spend as much time fleeing the players as they do fighting them. This “strategy” does give them a better shot at using their Cornered Rat ability before they are slain. Ratfolk slaves are also considered so expendable by other ratfolk that seeing them fleeing or slain isn’t a bother, and other ratfolk are unlikely to break and flee as a result.



#### Tactics: Council Guards
These are the most elite ratfolk soldiers and most atypical of their kind in terms of their combat behavior. Their primary goal is to safeguard their commander, and their Scurry Towards feature lets them intercept players trying to chase down said commander. Council guards will also never flee a fight if doing so would put the commander in jeopardy.

#### Tactics: Grey Seer
Like most spellcasters, grey seers will try to stay out of reach of the players and use minions as a meat shield. *Fissure* is an excellent spell for creating terrain that impedes the players, and Vermintide can be used to drop tides of rats on players who’ve fallen into the fissure or are trying to attack the grey seer. If players do manage to close into melee range, the warp staff attacks do high damage and prevent reactions, giving the grey seer an opening to retreat.

## Ratfolk Loot Guide
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying what goods are truly valuable items, not just trinkets they were trying to pretend were impressive status symbols.

### Lootable Ratfolk Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Ratfolk Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Grey Seer Items |  Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Religion |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. As ratfolk are quick to horde anything they might see as valuable, the difficulty in looting ratfolk often stems from sorting out actual valuables from items that have simply been made to appear valuable. 

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, a Monstrous Bone may be worth 10gp, but a Pristine Monstrous Bone would be worth 20gp, and a Cracked Monstrous Bone would be worth 5gp. Gems may be flawed, hide might be tattered, and metal corroded, cutting their value in half, and any item in pristine condition can be worth twice as much. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort.


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Bone | Gem | Hide | Metal |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1gp |  Rat Bone |  Green Quartz  | Leather Scraps | Blade Fragment |
|  10gp| Monstrous Bone |  Warp Stone  | Armored Leather | Intact Blade |
|  100gp| Trophy Bone |  Warp Gem  | Trophy Hide | Warp-Steel Fragment |
|  1,000gp| Eldritch Horn |  Warp Jewel  | Warp Leather| Warp-Steel Blade |

### Loot Tables

# Example Ratfolk Encounters

## The Vermin Tide <br> (Player Levels: 2-3 or 6-8)
In this encounter, the players wander into the abandoned remains of a ruined town before swarms of rats and ratfolk begin emerging from the shadows to attempt to overrun them. There are two versions of this encounter; one for players in the level 2-3 range and one for players in the level 6-8 range.


### Encounter Context
This encounter doesn't need much setup and only assumes the players are wandering into the ruins of a town they haven't been to recently. Players with experience fighting rats or ratfolk will have better odds with the fight, but it isn't necessary. The players can enter the map from either area 7 or 8.

### Lead Up

The players wander into the remains of a dilapidated town that appears to have been recently abandoned. As they approach the town's market square, they spot dead guardsmen near a well. As they start to investigate the bodies or the area, the ratfolk attack.

### The Ratfolk Mobs
When the encounter begins, a group of random ratfolk will scurry out from a random location on the map. You can roll a Dexterity (Stealth) check against the players' Passive Perception (PP) to determine if the players are surprised or not. To determine what types of ratfolk appear, roll on the Ratfolk Mob table below. To determine where they appear, roll a d8 and match the result with the corresponding map location.

After this first ratfolk mob appears, roll on the Ratfolk Mobs table to determine the type of mob that will appear next, and then roll for the location where that mob will appear. This next mob appears 3 rounds later. Players within 30 feet of that location with a PP of 12 or greater can hear them coming the round before they appear. Players with a PP of 15 or higher can hear them from 60 feet away, and players with a PP of 18 or greater can hear them from anywhere on the map.

Repeat this process until 3 randomly generated ratfolk mobs have appeared. The final mob you roll for will accompany a second "boss mob" as the capstone to the fight, which enters from a different random location. For the level 2-3 version of the encounter, this will be a **ratfolk storm vermin** who is the ratfolk leader. For the level 6-8 version of the encounter, it will be a **ratfolk chieftain**, who is the ratfolk leader, accompanied by 2 **ratfolk storm vermin**. If the ratfolk leader is slain, all remaining ratfolk will lose their resolve and flee the battle.

##### Encounter Map: Ruined Town

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>




### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The full moon casts the village in dim light. The building interiors are obscured in darkness.
* **Market Well.** The well in the market center is 30 feet deep. Attempting to climb out requires a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check. If a ratfolk falls down the well, remove it from combat unless it’s the chieftain or storm vermin who show up in the last wave of the encounter. If it is one of these “boss” ratfolk, have it try to climb out of the well (no check required, though it still climbs at half its move speed).
* **Elevated Areas.**  The areas of the map highlighted in green are at a higher elevation than the ground floor of the market. The height difference is described in the map.
* **Cover Areas.** The areas of the map highlighted in yellow are locations the ratfolk may try to retreat to after using their Scurry Away feature. The tents provide half cover to creatures within them and are destroyed after taking 10 damage. A creature can make a DC 11 Strength check to knock a tent over. If a creature is inside a tent that’s been knocked over, it is blinded and moves at half speed until it leaves the tent or cuts its way out with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage.

##### Ratfolk Mob Table
| 1d4  | Level 2-3 | Level 6-8 | 
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1 |  3 Ratfolk Clan Rats |  8 Ratfolk Clan Rats  |
|  2 | 5 Ratfolk Slaves |  4 Ratfolk Storm Vermin  | 
|  3 | 1 Ratfolk Clan Rat & 3 Ratfolk Slaves |  2 Ratfolk Storm Vermin & 6 Ratfolk Slaves  | 
|  4 | 2 Ratfolk Clan Rats & 1 Rat Swarm |  2 Groups of 8 Ratfolk Slaves, each appearing at a different location  |

### Encounter Tactics
The ratfolk fight using the same tactics outlined Ratfolk Encounter Guide. Ratfolk are likely to use their Scurry Away feature if they are fighting from a disadvantageous position, there is somewhere nearby they can hide, and there are nearby allies that make it difficult for them to be followed. If a ratfolk mob is near defeat but a new mob will be showing up soon, they are likely to use Scurry Away to attempt to survive long enough for reinforcements to arrive. However, they will not flee from the fight entirely until the ratfolk leader is killed or flees.

#### The Ratfolk Leader
The ratfolk leader, whether it be a storm vermin or a chieftain, will use its minions as disposable cannon fodder to be thrown at the players and pin them down. It will then move in and attack anyone that looks weakened or overwhelmed. The leader is recklessly confident and is unlikely to flee unless it is reduced to a quarter of its health or less, or the majority of its minions are dead or near death, and the players still look like they're going strong.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Aftermath
If all the ratfolk are slain or flee, the players will no longer be in any immediate danger. If the leader escapes, it will likely try to rally a new force of ratfolk and exact its revenge against the players. Though this could take days or even weeks. Any remaining ratfolk in the town will likely flee the players on sight unless they appear vulnerable. If the players were forced to flee, the ratfolk will hound them until they have made it well outside the outskirts of the town.





#### Loot
If the players search the area for valuables, they'll find a chest full of coins the ratfolk were hoarding and a valuable items carried by the ratfolk. They can also loot the individual ratfolk they slew using the guidelines from the Ratfolk Loot Guide. The amount of treasure they find will depend on the level of the encounter.

##### Level 2-3 Encounter Loot
* **Chest:** 1,230 cp, 1,175 sp, 93 gp
* **Individual Ratfolk Minions:** 3 Potions of Healing
* **Ratfolk Storm Vermin:** Warp Gem worth 100gp
##### Level 6-8 Encounter Loot
* **Chest:** 6,032 cp,7,879 sp, 1,862 gp, 1,132 pp
* **Individual Ratfolk Minions:** 3 Potions of Greater Healing
* **Ratfolk Chieftain:** 1 Fractured Warp Jewel worth 500gp


> ##### Looting Potions During Combat
> You can give the players the opportunity to loot the healing potions from the ratfolk mobs during the battle. Each mob should have a potion carried by one of its ratfolk that the players can grab and use to heal themselves during the fight. This can allow the players to reduce the fight's difficulty if they are willing to expend part of their loot right away.

#### XP Award: 1,000xp (Level 2-3) or 7,000xp (Level 6-8)
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The majority of the ratfolk and their leader were slain
* **100% XP:** The player won the fight, but the leader or a larger number of ratfolk escaped
* **50% XP:** The players slew the majority of the ratfolk mobs, but retreated before being able to defeat the leader
* **10% XP:** The players were forced to retreat before defeating the majority of the ratfolk mobs


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Remove the second mob that accompanies the ratfolk leader's mob. Cut the XP award by roughly 20%.

**Harder Encounter.** Have a new mob appear each round after the ratfolk leader appears. These new mobs should contain roughly half the number of ratfolk as what's presented in the table. Boost the XP award by roughly 20%.

## The Ruinous Ritual <br> (Player Levels: 16-18)
In this encounter, the players face off against a ratfolk grey seer performing a dark ritual to gain untold eldritch power. The seer is guarded by multiple ratfolk and protected by an arcane force shield that can only be dispelled by disabling three eldritch generators located across the map.


### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players are aware of the ratfolk grey seer and the ritual he is performing in his underground lair. This encounter’s chamber may even serve as the final room of a dungeon where the players have been fighting their way through ratfolk to reach the grey seer. 

### Lead Up
When the players arrive at the chamber, they will immediately see the grey seer performing his dark ritual, surrounded by a magical force shield. The eldritch generators glow as their vile machinery whirls, and the players will see the energy they generate being siphoned to the grey seer and his shield. You should make it clear to the players that the shield cannot be destroyed or dispelled through conventional means as it is being continually rejuvenated by the generators. Once the grey seer and his ratfolk minions notice the players, they will immediately attack.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The green glow of the ritual and the eldritch engines illuminates the chamber with dim light. If the ritual ends, there will be no light source in the room.
* **Elevated Areas.**  The areas of the map highlighted in green are at a higher elevation than the ground floor of the chamber’s entrance. The height difference is described in the map.
* **Generators.** The generators are Large objects with 30 hit points, AC 18, immunity to psychic and poison damage, and resistance to all spell damage. Attacks against it made from 5 feet away have advantage. A creature within 5 feet of it can make a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) check or an Intelligence check using tinker’s tools to disable a generator rather than destroy it.
* **Water.** The water in the champer is 10 feet deep and heavily polluted. Any creature that ends its turn in the water takes 3d6 poison damage.
* **Pipes.** The pipes crisscrossing the chamber have an AC 16 and immunity to psychic and poison damage. If 16 points of damage is dealt to a single section, it ruptures, filling a 10 foot area around it with the effects of the *cloudkill* spell for 1 minute (save DC 16). Once a section of pipe is burst this way, no pipes within 30 feet of it will produce this gas if they are destroyed.

##### Map Legend
* **C:** Ratfolk Council Guard 
* **G:** Eldritch Generator
* **P:** Ratfolk Poisoned Wind Globadier 
* **S:** Ratfolk Grey Seer
* **V:** Ratfolk Storm Vermin

### Encounter Tactics
The goal of all the ratfolk in this fight is to kill or drive off the players while protecting the grey seer’s ability to continue the ritual. Different ratfolk go about this in different ways, but they all answer to the grey seer.

#### Ratfolk Grey Seer
The grey seer can’t move from his location while performing the ritual, but he can still direct the other ratfolk, cast spells, and use his other abilities. The grey seer is intelligent enough that he can assess what types of saving throws each player will have a more difficult time dealing with, and will play on each player’s weaknesses whenever possible. 

##### Grey Seer Tactic Tips
* Have him use *chain lightning* as soon as he can target three or more players with it.
* Have him use *fireball* if he can hit two or more players with it. He will deem hitting minions with a fireball acceptable so long as he’s hitting more players than minions and the players have low odds of passing Dexterity saving throws.

<img src='https://i.ibb.co/4Kp08f0/The-Vermin-Ritual-Guide.png' style='position:absolute; top:70px; right:2px; width:415px; ' />


\pagebreakNum


* The *fissure* spell should be used following the same guidelines as the fireball spell, but only if it can be used without affecting an active generator. Any pipes in the fissure’s area are ruptured, and you can have the toxic water flow into the newly formed crevice if it makes sense.
* If the players are spread out, his Lightning Strike attack is usually his best option. Prioritize players surrounded by ratfolk to make use of the extra Overwhelming Mass damage.
* If a player reaches an active generator, that’s a good time to summon a rat tide to hinder that player.
* *Control winds* can be used to hinder player movement and keep them separated, so it’s harder for them to aid isolated and overwhelmed party members.

#### Council Guard and Storm Vermin
The grey seer will squeak orders at the council guard in Undercommon throughout the fight. Two council guards are stationed at each generator. If the players split up, sending high-speed characters to quickly disable the generators, the grey seer will order the council guard to leave their post and charge any fragile players that have been left exposed. This will be done in an attempt to force the other players to pull back to help their allies. If the players take a slower, more methodical approach, the council guard will hold their ground and wait for the players to come to them.
Storm vermin are more flexible in who and how they’ll fight and <br> will generally help gang up on any player engaged in <br> combat to help add to the damage of Overwhelming <br> Mass.

#### Poisoned Wind Globadiers
Globadiers will keep their distance and attempt to whittle down players from afar, even if it means hitting a ratfolk or two in the process. They will only engage in melee with players who are fragile and poor hand-to-hand combatants.

#### The Generators are Destroyed
If all the generators are destroyed, the grey seer will attempt to maintain his position by calling his remaining guards to protect him while he continues to bombard players from afar. If his platform ceases to be safe, or it’s clear he can’t defend it, he will break and flee. Spells like *control winds* and *fissure* can help hinder the players’ pursuit. Any remaining council guard will fight to the death to buy the grey seer time to escape, but the rest of the ratfolk will break and begin fleeing once they see their leader making a run for it.


### Aftermath
If the players are forced to flee, the ratfolk won’t pursue them out of sight of the chamber. The grey seer will continue his ritual, and it’s up to you how long it will take him to complete it and what the consequences are. The ritual might be minutes away from completion or hours. The completion of the ritual could result in a variety of deadly consequences, including, but not limited to:
* The grey seer summons a vermin lord
* The grey seer gains the stats of a vermin lord warpseer
* The grey seer summons an army of ratfolk
* The grey seer unleashes terrible disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, or meteor showers

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

If the players stop the ritual by destroying the eldritch generators but are forced to flee afterward, the grey seer will have them repaired and attempt to restart the ritual. This will likely take at least a day, if not more, and the grey seer may add extra safeguards, such as more minions, in case the players make a second attempt at stopping the ritual.
If the grey seer is forced to flee, he will likely be foiled in his attempt to complete his ritual and begin plotting revenge against the players.

#### Loot
The players can salvage valuable arcane components from each of the generators. Each generator yields 2d6 x 1,000 gp worth of salvageable goods. If a character with proficiency in Arcana or tinker’s tools salvages a generator, they loot 3d6 x 1000 gp worth of salvageable goods instead. 

The grey seer wears an eldritch amulet which served as the focal point for the ritual and is worth 10,000 gp.

As this was likely a climatic final battle part of a larger adventure, it is an opportune time to drop in any magic items appropriate to the players’ level that fit the environment or are useful to one or more of the players.

The players can also loot the individual ratfolk they slew using the guidelines from the Ratfolk Loot Guide.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Reduce the pairs of council guards to solo council guards. Change the XP Award to 33,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter.** Increase the pairs of council guards to trios of council guards. Increase the XP award to 50,000 XP.

> ***Devious Globadier.*** The ratfolk can use its action to throw a poisoned wind globe while frightened by its Scurry Away feature.
>
> ***Fragile Cargo.*** Whenever ratfolk suffers a critical hit or is reduced to 0 hit points, it shatters a poisoned wind globe centered on itself.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The ratfolk has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass x2.*** The first time each turn that the ratfolk hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 2 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The ratfolk can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.
>
> ***Ripped Gear.*** The ratfolk loses immunity to poison damage and poisoned condition when reduced to half hit points or less. This immunity loss lasts until it completes a short or long rest.

>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The ratfolk makes two dagger attacks. It can replace one attack with poisoned wind globe throw.
>
> ***Dagger.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 4 (1d4 + 2)
piercing damage.
>
> ***Poisoned Wind Globe.*** The ratfolk throws a poisoned wind globe up to 20 feet where it shatters on impact. Once shattered, it releases a cloud of poison gas in a 5-foot radius sphere, heavily obscuring the area. The cloud lasts for one round or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.
>
>When a creature enters an area covered by one or more of these gas clouds for the first time on a turn or starts its turn in one or more gas clouds, that creature must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 12 (2d8 + 3) poison damage and is poisoned until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t poisoned.
>
>The ratfolk can carry up to 6 poisoned wind globes at once. 
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
