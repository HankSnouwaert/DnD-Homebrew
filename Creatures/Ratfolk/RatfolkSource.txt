## Ratfolk

These devious and opportunistic humanoids scurry within the shadowy recesses of other civilizations, where they scheme ways to advance themselves and bring ruin upon their hated enemies.  And the enemies of a ratfolk are many, for most other humanoids view them with fear and disdain.  Thus, ratfolk live hidden within swamps, caves, sewers, or the ruins of other humanoids.  From here, there can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive.  
Some ratfolk find it in their best interest to bargain with and even form alliances with other races.  These alliances are almost always created out of a sense of survivalist pragmatism, and most ratfolk won't hesitate to cast them aside once they are no longer of use.  

### Nimble and Devious
Though ratfolk possess natural agility and a vicious bite, they don't typically confront their foes head-on.  Their smaller frames and lack of resources have made ratfolk accustomed to fighting at a disadvantage.  As such, ratfolk rarely believe in fighting fair.  They are twitchy and quick to scurry away if they perceive themselves in a losing fight.  

Skilled ratfolk can use this natural tendency to their advantage as they whittle enemies down with hit and run tactics.  Ratfolk also become more confident when attacking in numbers and quickly become more vicious when they are part of a swarm overwhelming their foes.

If worst comes to worst and they are <br> forced to flee, ratfolk can quickly squeeze their <br> way into tight crevices to escape attackers.  This  <br>ability also gives them a substantial combat advantage <br> when fighting in their claustrophobic underground homes, where they can pop from hidden alcoves to attack unsuspecting intruders.

### Bringers of Plague and Ruin
Most ratfolk live brutal lives in which pure survival is prioritized above all else.  The idea of shunning a source of power out of fear of corruption or avoiding tactics because they are dishonorable is absurd to them.  As such, ratfolk are known to be masters of many powers and abilities other races consider sinister.  Many ratfolk become deadly assassins, some possessing a supernatural mastery of their wicked craft.  Others tap into the notoriety of rats for swarming through civilization and spreading plagues.  These ratfolk may become carriers for terrible diseases which they can inflict upon their victims, or they may learn to command swarms of other vermin to overwhelm their foes.  Even ratfolk who pursue power through more conventional martial means utilize fear and underhanded tactics to obtain that power.

### Chieftains
These ratfolk occupy some of the highest positions of authority within their society. Chieftans are accomplished warriors and commanders who often command smaller groups of ratfolk within a clan. They usually answer to a more powerful warlord who may have several chieftains at his command. Though they must obey their commander without question, chieftains usually rule their given domain with absolute authority and are quick to quash any potential usurpers. By the same token, chieftains usually eye the position of warlord with envy, and those who are bold and opportunistic enough will eventually make a bid for greater power. 

In combat, chieftains command other ratfolk much in the same way as their warlord superiors. Their elite training, equipment, and resolve make them difficult to defeat, and their commanding presence keeps other ratfolk from routing as easily. As such, chieftains are often put in command of strike forces charged with dangerous missions that require higher levels of bravery than ratfolk are typically inclined to provide.

### Clan Rats

Ratfolk are a prolific, though short-lived, race. They rarely want for numbers, though few of their kind have the opportunity to develop specialized skills. In battle, ratfolk clans leverage the quantity-over-quality approach of their race to field overwhelming numbers of otherwise unremarkable troops. All healthy ratfolk are equipped with basic weapons and armor and given enough rudimentary training to put it to use. These clan rats then utilize their overwhelming mass to break enemy fighters they would otherwise be unable to defeat in a one-on-one fight.

Clan rats are called such because they are most often the core fighting force of a given ratfolk clan. However, clan rat is a broad term, and any healthy but otherwise unremarkable ratfolk with some weapon proficiency and battle gear could be referred to as a clan rat.

#### Volcanic Slashers

Some ratfolk clans make their underground homes in volcanic regions. They quickly learn how to utilize their fiery environment to their advantage, burrowing their homes around magma chambers that provide molten rock, useful for defending their lair with lava traps. The magma also proves useful for forging equipment, and ratfolk of these clans learn to imbue all their weapons with fiery properties. 

The warriors of these clans also prove to be much hardier and heat resilient, as those lacking these qualities don’t last long within their volcanic homes. Known as volcanic slashers, these specialty clan rats combine their high fortitude with flaming weapons to burn their way across the battlefield.

### Grey Seers

These eldritch ratfolk are born with grey or white fur and small horns that set them apart from their kin and mark them for a path of arcane greatness. They are trained to be grey seers, the spiritual leaders of ratfolk society who serve as messengers for their verminous god. This position of divine authority allows grey seers to remain somewhat above the petty machinations and power plays of other ratfolk, and even powerful warlords are weary of incurring the ire of a grey seer and, by proxy, its rat god.

 The favor of the rat god is made evident through the grey seer's devastating magical abilities. Using their ruinous magic, these ratfolk can conjure blasts of elemental magic, summon massive rat tides, or drive their allies into self-destructive battle frenzies. They are also notoriously difficult to pin down in combat, able to scurry just out of reach before unleashing their destructive magic. The protection of the rat god is ever-present, and even those able to make seemingly accurate attacks against a grey seer will often find their strikes suddenly veer off course, or their spells lose potency just as they reach their target.

#### Death Frenzy
*2nd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a sharp tooth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You send a creature into a frenzy that pushes its body beyond its limits. Choose a willing creature you can see within range. Until the spell ends, it takes 1d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns and has advantage on weapon and unarmed strike attack rolls until that turn ends. This damage can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

***At Higher Levels:*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. All the creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Fissure
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S,
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:** Druid
___

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt out from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long.  The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep.  If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and into the fissure.  Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side it moves to. 

The fissure deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with it when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the length by 20 feet and its depth by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

### Night Runners
While most ratfolk are known for <br> employing sneaky, underhanded tactics, <br> night runners make a career of it.  These <br> skirmishing soldiers fight in mobile packs <br> that utilize stealth and guerilla tactics to harry <br> their foes.  Once foes look sufficiently weakened <br> and vulnerable, night runners move in for the kill, <br> using a flurry of throwing stars and flashing blades <br> to quickly dispatch their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, night runners serve as light skirmisher infantry who utilize their mobility to harass and disrupt enemies ahead of attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a dangerous task with a low survival rate, ensuring that only the most skilled night runners advance far in their careers.

### Packmasters

Though the many giant rats and other rat  monstrosities lurking beneath the world's surface can be devastating weapons when  unleashed upon one's enemies, few <br> possess the capabilities to control them reliably <br> enough to do so. Ratfolk have a special affinity for <br> such creatures, and ratfolk packmasters are experts <br> at controlling these monsters and goading them into <br> battle. Packmasters utilize whips to keep their <br> bestial charges in line and to use as a weapon <br> when necessary. With each snap of the whip, <br> their war beasts are driven to heightened <br> levels of aggression. 

Packmasters also use wicked weapons <br> known as things-catchers, which, as the name <br> implies, they use to catch things. These <br> two-handed polearms have a large, tong-like <br> head with the inside of their grips lined with <br> spikes. Packmasters can use these weapons to <br> painfully capture and control creatures at a <br> distance, whether it's a new beast to train or <br> an enemy for their beasts to tear apart.

### Poisoned-Wind Globadiers

This insidious ratfolk infantry specializes in the use of poisoned wind globes. These glass orbs unleash clouds of toxic gas when they shatter, overwhelming groups of foes with choking fumes. A squad of these ratfolk can bring <br> down entire enemy formations with poison gas, and they <br> are especially adept at fumigating foes trapped in <br> enclosed spaces. As such, poisoned-wind globadiers are <br> often used to deal with enemies bunkered within rooms <br> or enclosed fortifications.

Poisoned-wind globadiers wear heavy robes and gas <br> masks made to protect them from their poisons, though <br> in combat, this gear can be damaged, leaving them <br> vulnerable to their own gases. This, combined with the fragility of the poisoned wind globes they carry, makes <br> heavy combat hazardous for these ratfolk, and many a globadier has died to the same gases that slew its foes. <br> As such, most globadiers stay out of the fray, dropping poisoned globes in the path of  pursuers.

### Plague Censer Bearers

For it is a great honor to die in bloody service to their holy crusade.  The sacred mission of every plague censer bearer is simply to slaughter as many of their blasphemous foes as they can before they succumb to their own deadly necrotic fumes.

### Ratfolk Slaves

These ratfolk represent the bottom rung of their <br> society. Numerous and expendable, they are <br> responsible for the lowliest and most dangerous <br> tasks, from unskilled labor to grislily test subjects. <br> Their low quality of life and hazardous duties make <br> their lives mercifully short, and most ratfolk slaves accomplish little with the time they have. 

In battle, other ratfolk use their slaves as canon <br> fodder to bog down foes. Their expendable nature <br> means other ratfolk have few qualms about giving <br> them suicidal tasks, and ratfolk slaves are often <br> subjected to friendly fire from the spells and <br> artillery of their ratfolk “allies.” 

Despite their frail nature and inferior physical <br> abilities, these lowly ratfolk can be quite ferocious <br> when they feel they have the upper hand. They <br> relish the opportunity to be tormenters rather <br> than the tormented and will utilize every <br> underhanded tactic available to them. However, <br> these ratfolk are cowards among a race known <br> for cowardice, and the moment the fight turns <br> against them, they are prone to scurry away. <br> Ratfolk slaves who die a coward’s death are liable <br> to get one last spiteful bite in as recompense for <br> a short, meaningless life of fear and pain.

### Storm Vermin


These ratfolk soldiers are the most massive and elite of their kind. Future storm vermin are identified at a young age by their clan as their size, aggressiveness, and dark fur easily distinguish them from the rest of their litter. They are then raised via brutal training regiments designed to shape them into elite warriors. Packs of storm vermin are given the best equipment in the clan and go on to serve as heavy infantry and personal retinues for powerful ratfolk commanders.

<br><br>

In combat, storm vermin are less prone to the cowardice of most rat folk soldiers. Their higher resolve and heavy armor allow them to hold the line against enemy combatants, and their size, training, and deadly weaponry allow them to cut a swath through most ordinary soldiers. Thus, storm vermin are often charged with protecting critical locations and individuals or leading rallying charges against particularly imposing foes.

#### Council Guard
These albino storm vermin are the most elite bodyguards in the ratfolks' under-empire. Though their origin is unknown, the council guard serve the most elite members of ratfolk society with an unquestioning loyalty almost alien to most ratfolk. No amount of bribery or coercion can shake a guard member's loyalty. They are even mute, thus preventing them from accidentally spilling any of their master's secrets. 


<br>

In combat, these hulking warriors fight with many times the ferocity of an ordinary storm vermin. Their implacable natures mean they will fight to the death if necessary, and no amount of magic can charm or frighten them into submission.

### Warlords

Though ratfolk aren’t known for their valor or powers of leadership, those that rise to the top of their martial <br> hierarchy possess an underhanded ferocity that can’t <br> be denied. These warlords combine martial skill, <br> devious tactics, and the ability to rally their otherwise <br> cowardly kin, making them foes that are <br> underestimated all too often. Even when a ratfolk <br> force appears to be routing, one rallying cry from <br> their warlord can turn them from a fleeing army <br> to one that’s quickly overwhelming their <br> overconfident enemies. 

When engaging enemies, ratfolk warlords can <br> utilize an array of weaponry, though brutal <br> spike fists are among their most favored tools. <br> They never fight fair and often use feinting <br> tactics, fleeing from  enemies who appear to <br> have a strong position and striking back at <br> them the moment they show weakness. <br> These strategies also serve to distract and <br> draw out their foes, allowing their minions to <br> surround and swarm the now vulnerable targets.

> ***Scurry Away.***  When an enemy the ratfolk can see ends its turn, the ratfolk can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the ratfolk can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
