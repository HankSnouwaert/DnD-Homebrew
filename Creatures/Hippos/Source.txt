# Hippos

Despite being strictly herbivorous, the hippopotamus is the most powerful river creature in the animal kingdom.  Reaching over 15 feet in length and weighing up to 4,000 pounds, not even crocodiles will trifle with an adult hippo.  With their dense hide, huge size, and massive jaws, they are the undisputed rulers of the riverways.

**Aggressive Nature**  The herbivorous nature of the hippopotamus in no way makes it docile or safe to approach.  Hippos are very aggressive and are likely to attack any creature that comes too close.  They will open their jaws wide in a threating manor to attempt to scare off intruders.  If that should fail, the unfortunate intruder will likely be charged and subjected to the hippo's mighty jaws.

**Blood Sweat.** Because hippos lack fur and live in very sunny environments, their skin is vulnerable to sun's harsh rays.  Infections from contaminated river water are also a concern.  

To combat this, hippos secrete an oily substance from their skin, often referred to as "blood sweat".  Blood sweat not only protects them from the sun's rays, but also helps prevent them catching diseases common to rivers.

**River Runners.** Though they are river creatures, hippos cannot swim.  Instead, they rely on their extremely dense bodies to allow them to run along the bottoms of rivers without impediment. They have been known to chase down boats this way, leaping up through the water and chomping through the unfortunate water vehicle.

**Hippopotamus Gorgops.** These monstereous creatures are primeval relatives of the modern hippopotamus.  Growing 15 feet long, 7 feet high, and weighing nearly 10,000 pounds, the the hippopotamus gorgops is a titan of the rivers.  Adventurers exploring remote and uncharted rivers may suddenly find themselves staring into the yawning jaws of these terrifying behemoths.

**Pygmy Hippos.** This smaller cousin to the common hippopotamus is quite elusive.  Pygmy hippos only reach 6 feet in length, 3 feet in height, and weight in at up to 600 pounds.  This, combined with their reclusive and solitary nature, makes them difficult to locate.  

They are much less common than other hippos and <br> their group sizes are much smaller, though local druids <br> and other forest folk will often befriend them.  Smaller <br> forest dwellers, such as forest gnomes, will sometimes <br> use pygmy hippos as mounts and beasts of burden, and <br> are very protective of their hippopotamid friends.
