## Warrior Priests
*Grim Religious Leaders Who Honor The Gods Through War*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Relics <br>
Many religious orders across the realms include warrior priests within their ministry, called forth to battle when unholy armies gather to spread woe. These devout followers excel in martial combat, protecting the bodies and souls of those who stand alongside them in the fight against evil. Clad in thick, gleaming chainmail adorned with holy symbols and sacred scrolls, warrior priests wield a shield in one hand and ornate warhammers that glow with divine power, enabling them to smite all manner of dreadful fiends. As they vanquish their adversaries, warrior priests recite battle prayers, blessing their comrades with righteous might to batter through their foes or granting sacred wards to shield them from harm. Such boons can turn the tide of battle, allowing common soldiers to fa

### Warrior Priest Tactics
The priest supports its allies by casting one of its aura spells from its Spellcasting feature, chosen based on the situation:

* **Aura of the Crusader.** The priest casts this spell when all allies are alive and able to fight, enhancing their offensive capabilities to maximize damage against enemies.
* **Aura of Might.** The priest casts this spell when enemies depend on tactical positioning, such as those using pack tactics or beneficial auras, or when battlefield hazards (e.g., cliffs, environmental dangers, or enemy spells like wall of fire) can be exploited to disrupt enemy formations.
* **Aura of Shielding.** The priest casts this spell as a last resort when only one ally remains or when enemies force the priest and its allies to make frequent Dexterity saving throws or rely solely on weapon attacks to deal damage.

### Arch Lector
Among the highest-ranking members of their holy orders, Arch Lectors are tasked with protecting entire cities, provinces, or even nations while enforcing the sacred doctrines of their church. These influential figures wield great authority both on and off the battlefield, involving themselves in matters of state and military to root out those they deem secular from positions of power. They ensure that those aligned with their god’s will find favor and high office. When the most wicked monstrosities threaten to topple the works of the gods, Arch Lectors march forth with steel-hearted soldiers, united in righteous fury to deliver justice to those who defy their deity. Such worshipers and beasts of enormity are shattered into burning rubble as the Arch Lector and his devout followers crash

#### Arch Lector Tactics
The lector follows the same tactics as the priest, casting aura spells from its Spellcasting feature based on the situation as described above. However, the lector prioritizes spreading its Smiting Warhammer attacks across multiple enemies to apply the Burning condition to as many targets as possible, maximizing ongoing Radiant damage.

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

## War Altars
For many churches, no possession is grander than a war altar dedicated to their patron god. These monuments are not easily crafted, achievable only by the most influential religions. First, a masterfully built statue—fashioned from gold, silver, or platinum in the likeness of the deity or a sacred creature—is created. This effigy is then placed upon an exquisite, massive chariot, which must be pulled by the mightiest of war beasts to move. Finally, a single stone pulpit is mounted on the hefty shrine, from which clerics and priests proclaim their god’s unrivaled greatness through sermons. War altars are paraded during sacred holidays and religious ceremonies to cement the authority of their faith, leaving the common folk of the land awestruck by their magnificence. Far from mere displays of grandeur, these altars radiate hallowed power that the devout can draw upon.

When brought into battle, the towering presence of a war altar inspires worshipers to acts of heroism, while foes falter or become utterly crippled in the face of its righteous splendor. ost potent of all is the priest riding the chariot, who can beseech their god to call down white flame, banishing and burning any who defy such reverential sovereignty.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

These instruments of divinity are rare, with many lost through the ages as governments fell into chaos or when carried to distant lands on harrowing crusades. Many sacred orders have dedicated their lives to seeking out these lost relics, for the discovery of such antiquities can restore an entire religion to prominence.

### War Altar Tactics
The altar is typically commanded by a priest riding it, using its Banishing Flames when it can target two or more enemies or a single Stunned creature to maximize the spell’s impact. The steeds pulling the altar use Holy Charge to move in and out of combat, striking Dazed or Stunned targets that cannot make opportunity attacks, then retreating to safer positions to maintain tactical advantage.



> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

While a creature attuned to the altar is riding it, it can use its action to expend 1 charge to cause a vertical column of divine fire, 10 feet in radius and 100 feet high, to descend at a point within 300 feet of the altar. Creatures in the area must succeed on a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 17. <bR> *Failure:* A creature takes 14 (4d6) Fire damage and 14 (4d6) Radiant damage. <br>
>
>*Fails by 5 or more:* The creature is aslo transported to a harmless demiplane for 1 minute or until the altar takes 30 or more damage in a single turn. While there, the target is Incapacitated. When the effect ends, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied. If the target is an Aberration, Celestial, Elemental, Fey, or Fiend, and the effect lasts for 1 minute, the target is instead transported to a random location on a plane (GM’s choice) associated with its creature type. <bR> *Success:* The creature takes half damage.
>
> ***Symbol of Might.*** While a creature attuned to the altar is with in 30 feet of it, the altar radiates a magical aura in a 30-foot emanation. Creatures of the rider's choice within the aura have advantage on saving throws.
>
> ***Holy Presence.*** While a creature attuned to the altar is with in 30 feet of it, the altar radiates a magical aura of authority in a 30-foot emanation. Any creature hostile to the rider that starts its turn within the emanation must succeed on a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 17 (with disadvantage if it is an *Undead* or *Fiend*). <br> *Failure:* The creature is Dazed* until the start of its next turn. <bR> *Fails by 5 or more:* The creature falls Prone and is Stunned until the start of its next turn. *Success:* The creature is immune holy presence of all war altars for 10 minutes.
>
> ### Steed Actions
>
> ***Holy Charge.*** Each steed pulling the altar can make a melee weapon attack against one creature within 5 feet of it. If the altar moved at least 20 feet in a straight line before the attacks are made, each attack deals an additional 16 (3d10) Radiant damage.

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.

\columnbreak

#### Constitution Saves
While objects are normally immune to effects that require a Constitution save, chariots are active combatants, meaning it often doesn't make sense for them to ignore effects that deal types of damage they are not immune to. As such, chariots can make Constitution saving throws against effects capable of damaging them and have their own modifier they apply to these saves. The chariot may make these saves regardless of whether or not it is being pulled by steeds.

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.
