## Flagellants

*Fanatical Doomsayers & Mad Zealots*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Relics <br>
Throughout the world, many kingdoms of good and <Br> civilized folk are plagued by ghastly raiders and monsters that descend upon prosperous cities and hamlets, razing these communities to the ground and inflicting terror-laden death—or worse—upon the populace. The few inhabitants who survive such massacres are forever scarred by the nightmarish onslaught they endure, often descending into hysteria and concluding that such events are omens of the world’s impending end. These assumptions drive refugees into madness, turning them into vagabonds who wander from one community to another, proclaiming that the final war between the forces of good and evil has begun. Such lunatics are drawn to the cries of doomsayers, whose demented preaching aligns with their delusions.

Thus, traveling groups known as flagellants form, their deranged members routinely flogging themselves with crude lashes, clubs, or other makeshift implements in repentance for their sins as they rave about the inevitable Armageddon descending upon the world. These disheveled wretches’ insanity often leads them to battle. When word reaches the band that a horrific beast or unholy marauders encroach upon the lands of order to plunder and bring ruin, they seek out such villainy, believing it to be the ultimate conflict to decide the fate of their souls. With fervent conviction, flagellants beat themselves into a frenzy, becoming numb to fear and pain, and charge even the most horrific adversaries, heedless of their own lives and striking with maniacal force. Most flagellants do not survive these encounters, dying on war-torn fields, their final moments reinforcing their belief that the end is upon them.

For the most part, flagellants direct their holy wrath toward truly wicked creatures or criminals, contributing to the fight against evil. However, it is not unheard of for these demented mobs to attack neighboring kingdoms they believe have fallen to sin or harbor wrongdoers. Worse still, the addled berserkers may be manipulated by conniving religious authorities who exploit them to further personal agendas, unleashing them on those who challenge their authority or interfere with their corrupt schemes.

### Tattersouls
The Tattersouls are a renowned religious order whose prophecies of annihilation have spread far and wide. Their members radiate a fervent aura, contagious and alive with its own fervor, compelling others to join their cause. This radical devotion was first sparked by great warrior priests whose sanity shattered in battles against the children of chaos. Returning home, his body covered in gashes and his former personality eradicated, consumed by mania. Only dire warnings of great, terrible forces of chaos issued from his lips, delivered with such conviction that they set aflame the souls of all who heard them.

Thus, others were converted to the priest’s crusade of despair, their numbers swelling as they marched onward. In a liturgical furor, they thrash themselves insensibly, their frenzy so intense that onlookers are compelled to join the horde’s ceremonies. These newcomers seize whatever implements they can find to perform their penances, their pained shrieks mingling into a cacophonous hymn. Some join only briefly, eventually coming to their senses and returning home battered and bewildered. Others, however, abandon all they knew, fully merging with the congregation.

Wherever agents of chaos descend to sow destruction, the Tattersouls are drawn, seeking to purge such evil with divine hatred. Their reckless charges against their vile adversaries often decimate their numbers, yet their foes are invariably obliterated or driven back to the dark places from whence they came. As the dust clears, distraught bystanders who witnessed the bloody conflict take up the fallen warriors’ weapons and whips, carrying on their hallowed hysteria.

### Harbingers of Doom
Shepherding processions of crazed flagellants with their hysteria-provoking sermons, these grim figures are known as Harbingers of Doom. Such preachers possess a radical faith that makes them dangerous both on and off the battlefield.

Most communities disregard their warnings, which insist that locals are living in sin and must find salvation before the world burns in the coming fires of war. Such deranged babbling is either ignored or met with the lunatic being pelted with rotten food. However, communities that suffer untold hardship are far more credulous to such prognostications and will follow these figures in hopes of seeking redemption within their mad sect. In times of great strife, entire populations can be uprooted, transformed into inimical mobs roaming the countryside, purging any heinous creatures in their wake.

When conflict inevitably arises, Harbingers of Doom possess a strength born of unbreakable piety, capable of crushing a hellhound. Chanting prayers of deliverance, they enable themselves and their deranged flock to survive wounds that would kill an ordinary person, enduring long enough to purify their souls in holy combat.

### Flagellants, Tattersouls, and Harbinger of Doom Tactics

&emsp;**Flagellants and Harbinger of Doom.** Use their Penitent Flagellation ability to increase their damage each turn unless they have 5 or more Fury or fewer than 15 Hit Points, and use Reckless Attack when they have 3 or more levels of Fury.

**Tattersouls.** Transfer their Fury to the target capable of performing the most attacks in a turn and who has the most Hit Points.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Fury  
> The creature gains levels of Fury that cause its attacks to deal increasing amounts of damage with each level.
> * The creature can only gain levels of Fury during combat, and all levels are lost when combat ends.
> * A creature can gain up to a max of 6 levels of Fury.
> * First time each turn the creature hits a target with an attack, it deals an additional 1d4 damage for each level of Fury it has.
> * A creature also loses all levels of Fury if it becomes Charmed or Frightened, or is affected by the *calm emotions* spell.  It also can't gain levels Fury while under these conditions.
