## Witch Hunter Bands
Most witch hunters work alone in their quest to destroy the unholy, but some form small bands with others who have also dedicated themselves to these sacred endeavors. Within these hunting parties, a variety of specialized hunters can be found, each excelling in their own field and wielding unique weapons. The combination of these resolute warriors is a death sentence for any monster or individual deemed guilty of committing atrocities.

### Woodsman

Woodsmen are specialized hunters who thrive in the shadowy, monster-infested forests. These towering, solemn figures wield axes originally designed for splitting logs. Navigating dense undergrowth where most would fear to tread, they patrol diligently, ever alert for the rustling of leaves or the glint of predatory eyes in the gloom. Many travelers owe their lives to woodsmen who rush forward, positioning themselves between the villain and their next victim, delivering a tree-toppling blow with their axe. These strikes are so powerful that tales are told of woodsmen felling ravenous trolls, hags, and other giant beasts.

#### Woodsman Tactics
The woodsman targets the largest creature with the lowest Dexterity within close range, imposing disadvantage on its attacks against other creatures.

### Marksman

Masters of archery, marksmen are armed with expertly crafted crossbows of enormous proportions. They load these with a varied assortment of thick bolts made from materials such as silver, cold iron, or sacred oak, ensuring no spawn of evil is safe from their wrath. When their quarry is spotted, marksmen position themselves to deliver devastating shots. A well-placed bolt can thrust a pierced creature backward, embedding the arrow in a nearby wall and pinning the victim against it. Most monsters are already dead by the time they are nailed down, becoming macabre decor. 

\columnbreak

<br>

More resilient, nightmarish foes of unnatural constitution may squirm and scream, struggling to escape their restraints, but trapped victims are rarely fast enough to avoid another arrow that either further secures them or ends their miserable existence.

#### Marksman Tactics

The Marksman targets opponents with low Strength, attempting to pin them against walls. They may goad enemies into chasing them by using the Dash or Disengage action, luring them toward a wall to pin them.

### Interrogator

Interrogators are perhaps the most feared breed of witch hunter, dreaded by both the guilty and the innocent. Masters of torture, they excel at extracting confessions and information from anyone they apprehend. Even the most black-hearted and zealous cultist becomes contrite when subjected to the Interrogator’s holy brand, renouncing their dark ways. However, such victims can only hope for their suffering to end in death. 

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Interrogators descend upon towns where they suspect secret covens or cults have taken root. These communities are overwhelmed with terror as the hunters stalk through the night, dragging away anyone they believe knows about blasphemous activities, brutally gathering any information they can.

#### Interrogator Tactics

Interrogators are vindictive and target those they deem most sinful, even if they have high bonuses to Deception.

### Hound Master

Hound masters command one or more fiercely loyal hunting hounds, each subjected to rigorous and ruthless training. These hounds wear collars adorned with charms that ward off dark magic, ensuring they do not falter even when facing the most horrific aberrations. Working in tandem with their masters, the hounds coordinate to outmaneuver even the deadliest adversaries, shredding them in a flurry of blades and teeth. Through perilous excursions, hunter and hounds form a fierce loyalty to one another. Over time, the dogs become as somber as their masters. Should a member of the pack fall in battle, the others exact cruel vengeance on the perpetrator.

\columnbreak

<br>

#### Hound Master and Hounds Tactics

Hound Masters are typically accompanied by two witch hunter's hounds. The hounds dash toward a spellcaster marked by the master, hounds granting him advantage on his musket attack. The master then approaches the target and draws his scimitars to finish them off.

> ##### Trained Beasts
>
> Trained beasts acquire skills over the years, similar to how players gain experience in a class. This means spells and abilities, such as *polymorph* or a druid's Wild Shape, cannot transform a creature into a trained beast.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.
