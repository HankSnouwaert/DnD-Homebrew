## Witch Hunters
*Zealous & Resourceful Hunters of Heresy*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Relics <br>

Worming their way through societies are nefarious cults acting in secret on behalf of dark gods and demons. Such acolytes seek to hollow out bastions of order with their corrupt schemes until all morality crumbles and is lost. This infectious and subtle evil has given rise to righteous organizations and individuals who have taken it upon themselves to purge these malignant influences.

These slayers are commonly referred to as witch hunters. Though their appearance can vary widely, and the weaponry they employ in their grim profession differs depending on the type of foul wretches they specialize in hunting, all are mirthless in demeanor and unwavering in their hallowed duty. Neither temptations nor compassionate begging can sway a witch hunter from their moral strictures. Such relentless individuals are solitary by nature, whether driven by their own self-granted vow to weed out the wicked or acting on behalf of a guild dedicated to eradicating practitioners of the profane.

Witch hunters stalk cities and villages, ever vigilant for signs or stories of unholy influence. When such spoor is detected by the hunter, they pursue tirelessly, ultimately acting as judge, jury, and executioner once the source is found.

Their final sentences are myriad: a silver bullet to the head, a cold iron stake through the heart, or being burned alive in hallowed fire. 

Even the most adaptive sorcerers and vile devils find it nearly impossible to avert such fates, as witch hunters are adorned with trinkets and holy symbols that turn aside all manner of terrible incantations and curses.

Though witch hunters cleanse the world of the most heinous individuals, the innocent must also fear their wrath. Merciless in their destruction of the iniquitous, witch hunters will burn to ashes anyone or anything bearing even the slightest hint of dark influence. Many villages have been razed to the ground and entire populations executed to ensure no cultist escapes their divine judgment.

### Witch Hunter Tactics

Witch hunters single out a target, typically a spellcaster, and focus on them throughout the fight. They use pistols while closing in, then switch to a rapier to disrupt spellcasting. Most witch hunter weapons have secondary effects designed to negate specific magical abilities, and they always target enemies most vulnerable to these effects.

### Witch Hunter Weapons

You can replace the witch hunter's default Spellbane Rapier or Spellbane Pistol with one of the following melee or ranged weapons, respectively. The witch hunter always wields one melee weapon and one ranged weapon.

#### Melee Weapons

&emsp;***Spellbane Rapier.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) Slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) Radiant damage, and the target cannot cast spells other than cantrips until the end of its next turn.

***Silver Stake.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) Piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) Radiant damage, the target cannot regain hit points until the end of its next turn, and any creature that is Charmed or Frightened by the target is no longer Charmed or Frightened.

***Torch of Holy Flame.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d8 + 4) Radiant damage, and the target gains the Burning* condition, taking 5 (1d10) Radiant damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends.

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid. 
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

<br>

#### Ranged Weapons

&emsp;***Spellbane Pistol.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) Piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) Radiant damage. A creature making a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage has disadvantage on the saving throw. The witch hunter has four pistols and cannot use a pistol again until it uses an action to reload one or replaces an attack from the Attack action to reload one.

***Stalker’s Crossbow.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) Piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) Radiant damage, and the target cannot teleport or become Invisible until the end of its next turn.

***Persecutor’s Volley Gun.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 100/400 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (6d4 + 3) Piercing damage plus 5 (1d10) Radiant damage. If the attack misses, the target takes 7 (3d4) Piercing damage. The witch hunter cannot use the volley gun again until it uses three actions to reload it.



**New condition described above*
