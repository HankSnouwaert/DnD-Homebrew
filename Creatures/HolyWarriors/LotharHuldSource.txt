## Lothar Huld
*The Wandering Prophet*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Relics <br>

In a verdant countryside, where emerald hills rolled beneath the watchful gaze of the heavens, there stood a grand monastery, its stones whispering with the prayers of ages, hewn to honor the High God of Light, guardian of the green lands and shepherd of his chosen disciples.

One shadowed eve, a boy appeared at the gates of this hallowed sanctum. Priests, their faces shadowed by sacred cowls, ushered the child within and questioned whence he came. No tale of his past did he offer, save his name—Lothar Huld—and a vow that burned in his voice: to be forged into a slayer of the dark minions of the forsaken gods in the name of the radiant deity of light.
The monks, moved by his fervor, granted him shelter. They raised him within the sacred walls, teaching him the holy tenets of their divine lord and forging his spirit and sinew into a warrior of unyielding resolve. Years passed, and Lothar, tempered by relentless training under the gaze of their lord’s eternal light, emerged a champion bishop of the light, a blazing sword sworn to purge the world of chaos’s brood.

His quest led him to remote hamlets, where unholy marauders—spawn of the forbidden gods—wrought terror upon the innocent. In each village, Lothar’s voice thundered with holy sermons, kindling righteous fervor in the hearts of trembling townsfolk. They rose as one, their fear transmuted into zeal, and followed him into battle. Each swing of his hammer smote a blighted beast; each hallowed prayer made wicked spawn cower and burn in the fires of divine judgment. For in the fury of combat, Lothar became a vessel of his god, wielding his patron’s majesty as a flame against the dark.

Such victories echoed across the land, and the clergy of the great god sang Lothar’s deeds, proclaiming him a prophet. Yet, as his star ascended within the sacred order, Lothar beheld a bitter truth: the corruption he sought to vanquish had taken root within his own faith. Chaplains and priests, swayed by ambition and glittering coin, had forsaken their vows, sullying the name of their lord with conceit and avarice.

With a heart resolute yet shadowed by sorrow, Lothar denounced his brothers, his voice a clarion against their perfidy. Thenceforth, he rode forth upon his black steed, Sanctus, a solitary crusader, rooting out malignant forces wherever they lurked—be they in shadowed glades or the very halls of the righteous. The faith stood divided, torn by his ordained doom. Many within the sect whispered of unease, for priests and bishops, found perverse or in league with the acolytes of the forbidden gods, lay dead—struck down, it was said, by the prophet’s hand.

Now, Lothar rides still, his steed’s hooves heralding the approach of judgment. He declares the end nigh, and the faithful tremble, uncertain whether his path be salvation or the ruin of all he holds dear.

### Lothar Huld Tactics 
&emsp;**Choosing Targets.** Lothar prioritizes the creature with the lowest Strength to maximize the impact of his Crushing Hammer. He uses Hallowed Judgment against martial fighters with low Wisdom. Condemned is employed to pull in ranged attackers, preventing their escape. When alone, Lothar activates his Reckoning ability on his first turn.

**Holy Followers.** Lothar’s *circle of power* greatly benefits his followers, encouraging them to stay close. As followers accumulate Fury over time, Lothar delays using Reckoning until most are heavily damaged or dead. This maximizes damage of the followers, as followers lose their Fury upon death.

**Sanctus.** When riding Sanctus, Lothar’s tactics remain largely unchanged. He focuses on charging in and out of combat to optimize Sanctus’s Hooves attack.



### Epic Battle: The Grand Prophet 
If you wish to make Lothar into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 390, and give him the Fiery Demagogue trait, described below. This increases his CR to 18. 

***Fiery Demagogue (Recharges after a short or long rest).*** If Lothar Huld becomes Bloodied (195 HP), he may either recharge his Reckoning ability if it has been used, or he may use the ability with expending a use of the feature.

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.



> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

> ### Traits  
>  
> ***Fanatical Devotion.*** Lothar has advantage on saving throws against being Charmed or Frightened.  
>  
> ***Reckoning (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** On Initiative Count 30, Lothar can declare a time of reckoning, ending any effects that cause him to be Incapacitated and becoming empowered with holy might until Initiative Count 20 of the next round. While empowered, he has resistance to all damage and advantage on all saving throws.  
>  
> ### Actions  
>  
> ***Multiattack.*** Lothar makes two Crushing Warhammer attacks while empowered*.  
>  
> ***Crushing Warhammer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) Bludgeoning damage plus 5 (1d10) Thunder damage. The target must succeed on a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 18 (DC 21 if Lothar is empowered). <br> *Failure:* Lothar automatically hits the target with another Crushing Warhammer attack as part of this action (this does not tigger another saving throw). <br> *Failure by 10 or more:* The extra attack is a critical hit.  
>  
> ### Bonus Actions  
>  
> ***Spellcasting.*** Lothar can cast *circle of power*, using Wisdom as the spellcasting ability.
>  
> ### Monstrous Actions  
>  
> Lothar gains two additional actions in combat: Hallowed Judgment and Condemn. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count, separate from Lothar’s. On the action’s initiative count (losing ties), Lothar can take one of these actions if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.  
>  
> ***Hallowed Judgment (Initiative Count 10).*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 18 (DC 21 if Lothar is empowered), one creature of Lothar’s choice within 60 feet that he can see. If Lothar is empowered, he can choose any number of creatures within 60 feet to be affected.  
>  
> *Failure:* The target gains the Burning* condition, taking 11 (2d10) Radiant damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends. While Burning*, the target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius, attack rolls against it have advantage, and it can’t benefit from the Invisible condition.   
>  
> *Failure by 5 or more:* The target is also Frightened. While Frightened, its Burning* condition cannot be ended by nonmagical means. The target can make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the Frightened condition on a success.  
>  
> ***Condemn (Initiative Count 1).*** Lothar, or a creature he is mounted on, moves up to 20 feet in a straight line, then Lothar slams his hammer, unleashing a wave of destruction. *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 18, each creature Lothar chooses in a 15-foot cube originating from him. <bR> *Failure:* The creature takes 10 (3d6) Thunder damage and is pulled 30 feet towards Lothar. <bR> *Failure by 5 or more:* The target is Dazed* until the end of its next turn.  
>  
> If Lothar is empowered, the cube is 30 feet instead of 15 feet.  
>  
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Lothar is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.  
>  
> **New condition described on previous page*
