## Grand Theogonists
*Supreme Commanders of the Church of War*<br>
**Habitat:** Any; **Treasure:** Relics <br>

The highest position within the religious orders of the Holy Church of the Mortal Realm is that of the Grand Theogonist. Only the most pious, enlightened, and inspiring individuals can ascend to this revered title. Such a leader must faithfully uphold the dogma passed down through generations, maintain unity and prosperity within the faith, and spread its virtuous proclamations. Simultaneously, they are tasked with rooting out the venomous enemies of the Church—those whose foul practices are anathema to the sect.

Grand Theogonists are also the fiercest warriors within the Church’s hierarchy, wielding heavenly power that rivals the might of the greatest celestials. After years of rigorous religious study and disciplined practice, these leaders master the recitation of mystic vows and prayers. These sacred benedictions hold such divine power that they bestow upon the Grand Theogonists deific might, capable of sweeping aside even the most formidable demons.

 Cults and individuals who defy the righteous judgment of lesser clergy inevitably draw the seraphic wrath of the Grand Theogonist.

Mounted atop a grand altar of oaths—a towering golden icon dedicated to their patron lord—the Grand Theogonist can summon empyrean storms to crush their iniquitous foes. Wielding an ornate staff, a symbol of their supreme authority, they unleash sheathed lightning, thunder, and holy fire, purging the impure whose bodies are broken and burned away. When such a divine weapon is unleashed, entire cities deemed wicked are reduced to smoldering ruins.

### The Lair of The Grand Theogonist
The Grand Theogonist resides within an immaculate cathedral, the spiritual heart of the Holy Church of the Mortal Realm. Towering marble ribs uphold a vast ceiling adorned with vibrant frescoes, while colossal statues line the walls, these masterpieces immortalizing the heroic deeds of the Church’s past champions and saints who devoted their lives to their god’s divine cause.
The baroque sanctuary dominates the nave, its golden-lined pulpit intricately etched with holy symbols woven throughout its structure. The air hums with sacred incense, and hundreds of candles burn with heavenly light. Stained glass windows cast radiant beams that dance across the polished stone floors, illuminating this hallowed space where the divine and mortal converge. Here, the Grand Theogonist delivers stirring sermons that ignite fervent devotion and performs miracles that uplift the faithful, rousing them to unparalleled acts of greatness.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid. 
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

\columnbreak

#### Regional Effects
The area where the Grand Theogonist dwells is made holy by his presence, creating one or more of the following effects within 1 mile of his lair:

* While in his lair, the Grand Theogonist can cast *commune*, *dispel evil and good*, *greater restoration*, *raise dead*, and *hallow* without material components, using Charisma as his spellcasting ability. Once he casts a spell this way, he can’t cast the same spell again for 24 hours.

* The area is under the effects of the *forbiddance* spell, targeting Elementals, Fey, Fiends, and Undead, and dealing Radiant damage. If the effect is dispelled, it is automatically recast on the area after 24 hours.

* Creatures in the area have advantage on saving throws forced by aberrations, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

If the Grand Theogonist dies or moves his lair, these effects end immediately.


### Epic Encounter
To make the Grand Theogonist a true endgame threat, pair him with his Altar of Oaths, drawn by two Sacred Warhorses. Together, they form a CR 27 encounter.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Fanatical Devotion.*** The theogonist has advantage on saving throws against being *Charmed* or *Frightened*.
>
> ***Invoke Prayers.*** At the start of its turn or when it rolls initiative, the theogonist can choose one of the following prayers to become active until the end of combat. Once a prayer is chosen, it cannot choose another until it takes 100 damage or three rounds of combat have passed, and it cannot choose the same prayer twice in the same combat. The theogonist can have multiple prayers active at a time:
> - **Prayer of Ancients.** If the theogonist has 1 or more hit points, it regains 30 hit points.
> - **Prayer of Devotion.** The theogonist gains a +5 bonus to its attack rolls.
> - **Prayer of Vengeance.** The theogonist vows enmity against a creature it is aware of within 90 feet. Until the end of combat, the theogonist deals an extra 10 (3d6) Radiant damage to the target whenever it hits with a weapon attack.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The theogonist makes a number of attacks equal to the number of prayers it has chosen (1–3). Each attack must use a different Staff of Command effect.
>
> ***Staff of Command.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit (+16 with Prayer of Devotion), reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (1d8 + 5) Bludgeoning damage. The theogonist chooses one of the following additional effects on hit based on its active prayer:
> - **Prayer of Ancients.** The attack deals an additional 5 (1d10) Lightning damage, and the target can’t take reactions or bonus actions until the end of its next turn.
> - **Prayer of Devotion.** The attack deals an additional 5 (1d10) Radiant damage. The target gains the Burning* condition, taking 11 (2d10) Radiant damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends. While Burning, the target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius, attack rolls against it have advantage, and it can’t benefit from the Invisible condition.
> - **Prayer of Vengeance.** The attack deals an additional 5 (1d10) Thunder damage. The theogonist knocks the target Prone and may push it up to 15 feet away from itself.
>
> ### Prayer Actions
>
> The theogonist gains one additional action for each prayer it has chosen, usable on the specified initiative count (losing ties) if it is not Incapacitated. It can replace any action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated:
>
> ***Prayer of Vengeance (Initiative Count 20).*** The theogonist, or a chariot with steeds it is riding, moves up to 30 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. The theogonist can make two Staff of Command attacks against the same target, both using the Prayer of Vengeance effect.
>
> ***Prayer of Devotion (Initiative Count 10).*** The theogonist, or a chariot with steeds it is riding, moves up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. The theogonist makes Staff of Command attacks against any number of creatures within 10 feet, with a separate attack roll for each target, using the Prayer of Devotion effect.
>
> ***Prayer of Ancients (Initiative Count 1).*** The theogonist, or a chariot with steeds it is riding, moves up to 15 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. The theogonist throws its staff like a lightning bolt, making Staff of Command attacks against any number of creatures in a 90-foot, 5-foot wide line, with a separate attack roll for each target, using the Prayer of Ancients effect. These are ranged attack rolls, and the staff teleports back to the theogonist’s hand after the attacks.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the theogonist is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of its turn, it can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.
>
> **New condition described on previous page*

### Grand Theogonist Tactics
The Arch Lector invokes prayers from its Invoke Prayers trait in this preferred order:
* **Prayer of Devotion:** The most powerful prayer; use first to maximize impact.
* **Prayer of Vengeance:** Use second, targeting the most dangerous enemy, typically a powerful spellcaster, with Staff of Command attacks.
* **Prayer of Ancients:** Use last when enemy numbers are reduced to outlast remaining adversaries.

#### Grand Theogonist Attack Actions
The theogonist uses Multiattack with Staff of Command, prioritizing these targets for each prayer effect:

* **Prayer of Devotion:** Target the enemy marked by Prayer of Vengeance or the most dangerous enemy. If that enemy is already Burning, target a different enemy if it is safe to do so.
* **Prayer of Vengeance:** Target the enemy marked by Prayer of Vengeance or the most dangerous enemy, or push a supportive enemy (e.g., a paladin) to disrupt their positioning.
* **Prayer of Ancients:** Target the enemy marked by Prayer of Vengeance or the most dangerous enemy, unless another target (e.g., a rogue or monk) relies heavily on bonus actions.

#### Grand Theogonist Prayer Actions
The theogonist uses Prayer Actions on their initiative counts with these tactics:
* **Prayer of Vengeance (Initiative Count 20):** Target the marked enemy, positioning to push it near allies for follow-up attacks with other Prayer Actions.
* **Prayer of Devotion (Initiative Count 10):** Target a group of enemies not already Burning, hitting as many as possible within 10 feet.
* **Prayer of Ancients (Initiative Count 1):** Target a line of enemies, prioritizing those the theogonist has advantage against.


### Altar of Oaths and Sacred Warhorse Tactics

The altar, commanded by a theogonist, and its sacred warhorse steeds charge in and out of combat, coordinating with the theogonist’s tactics. The altar uses Invoke Power and the horses use Holy Charge, targeting based on the theogonist’s active prayer:

* **Prayer of Ancients:** Target the largest group of spellcasters with Invoke Power. Horses target Prone or Restrained enemies with Holy Charge.
* **Prayer of Devotion:** Target the largest group of enemies with low Constitution using BInvoke Power. Horses target these enemies with Holy Charge.
* **Prayer of Vengeance:** Target the largest group of enemies, preferably including the theogonist’s Prayer of Vengeance marked target, with Invoke Power. Horses target brittle enemies with Holy Charge.
