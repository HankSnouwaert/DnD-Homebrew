# Owls
These nocturnal birds of prey are often seen as symbols of wisdom and the ever-present perceptiveness of the wilds.  Though, among some cultures, they are instead viewed as cursed omens of death and misfortune.  Owls can be found swooping across snowy tundras or perched ominously on dead tree branches deep within dark forests, their everpresent hooting echoing through the night.   By day, they are beautiful and sometimes even adorable hunting birds.  But by night, their glowing eyes strike fear into the hearts of travelers, reminding them the wilds are always watching.

**Stealthy Hunters.** Most owls are less than two feet in length and have wingspans ranging from 1 to 6 feet across.  As such, their primary prey tends to be small rodents and rabbits.  Owls spot their quarry in the dead of night using superior dark vision and hearing.  Their nocturnal prey often relies on hearing to detect predators.  To counter this, owls have developed specialized feathers which allow them to fly slowly and stealthily, catching their unsuspecting meal by surprise.

**Wizarding Familiars.** The stealth and keen senses of the owl make it a popular familiar amongst magic users.  Its associations with wisdom further its appeal amongst those with scholarly inclinations.  Wizarding schools often make extensive use of owls in their symbology and as familiars used for information gathering and parcel delivery.  Amongst magic users with a more sinister bent, owls can also serve as menacing familiars to spy on enemies and inspire fear and paranoia amongst superstitious commoners.

> ##### Waterlogged Owls
> Unlike most other birds of prey, owls do not possess a waterproof undercoat.  While short periods in the rain won't hinder them, if they become soaked in water, their fluffy feathers will absorb so much of it that they become too heavy and waterlogged to fly.  Owls in this state are extremely vulnerable and must dry out before they can fly again.  If you wish to incorporate this in your games, you can include a rule that owls soaked in water lose their fly speed until they dry off.

**Great Horned Owls.** The great horned owl is among the most far-ranging and dangerous of all its kind. These deadly birds of prey can measure over two feet in length and sport five-foot wingspans. Their talons can deliver crushing forces ten times what a typical human can produce, allowing them to kill most small prey instantly. This hunting prowess allows great horned owls to hunt a wide range of prey with impunity, and some have even been reported hunting animals as large and dangerous as foxes and bobcats.

**Giant Owls.** In some extremely wild and dangerous areas, man-sized owls hunt much larger prey than their mundane counterparts.  These beasts are favored guardians and companions to many woodland races, and smaller peoples, such as forest gnomes, will even use them as flying steeds.  When giant owls contact traveling humanoids, they will not hesitate to hunt them like any other animal.  Villagers living near giant owl territory rarely travel alone or unarmed and always keep an eye to the treeline. 

**Monstrous Owls.**  Some owls obtain supernatural levels of size and intelligence.  They may be part of a larger species of monstrous owls or may have once been typical owls that were transformed through magical means.  In either case, their enhanced abilities make them deadly foes and powerful allies.  These owls will often align themselves with other fey and intelligent woodland beings.  Some are noble guardians, working with druidic circles to watch over and safeguard the wilds.  Others are brutal killers, serving dark fey as spies and assassins while mercilessly hunting down any who trespass upon their wilds.

## Owlbears
These beasts are monstrous amalgamations of giant owls and grizzly bears.  Owlbears possess the stealthiness and deadly beak of a giant owl, the sheer size, power, and aggression of a grizzly bear, and the heightened senses of both.  They are fiercely territorial hunters and will attack almost anything that crosses their path without provocation.  However, through tremendous effort, some races can train owlbears as fierce guardians and terrifying battle mounts.

**Snowy Owlbears.** This subspecies of owlbear is native <br> to arctic environments and appears  to be a combination of snowy owl and polar bear.  It behaves much like other owlbears, but its polar bear nature makes it somewhat larger and much heartier than its temperate cousins.  The harshness of its environment also makes it a deadlier and more determined hunter.  Snowy owlbears are unrelenting in their pursuit of prey, willing to climb treacherous mountains and swim through icy waters to secure their kills.

## Strix
All the omens and superstitions regarding owls are made manifest in the dreaded strix.  These fiends are quite literally living curses shaped into the form of a dread owl with glowing malevolent eyes and wings that move in an almost incorporeal and dreamlike fashion.  This leads some to believe they are creations of dark magic, used by wicked spell casters to hunt their victims.  Others believe them to be fiends native to the underworld sent to reap the souls of the damned.  Regardless of their origin or motivation, once a strix has marked someone for death, there is little hope of escaping its terrible curse.  

**The Dread Curse.** Strixes are cursed omens of death given physical form, and they seek to spread their curse to others.  When a strix marks someone for death, it will stalk its victim, sometimes for nights on end.  This stalking involves waking up the victims with terrifying calls in the night and watching them through darkened windows with shining eyes.  When their prey's mounting dread reaches its peak, the strix will strike, its talons imparting a fatal curse.  The doomed individual then has twenty-four hours to live before their soul is violently ripped from their body by the curse.  The only way to break to curse is to hunt down the strix and nail it to a wooden door, dead or alive, using an iron nail.

**Servants of Dark Powers.** Strixes often act in the service of dark masters.  Hags and witches may summon a strix to enact vengeance upon someone who has crossed them, underworld fiends may send strixes to collect souls they've won through dark dealings, and dark wizards may summon strixes to use as twisted familiars.  Regardless of its master or mission, the strix will act with a single-minded malevolent determination to carry out its dark purpose.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma saving throw or be cursed by the strix.  The cursed creature dies in the next 24 hours unless the curse is removed.  The creature is aware of the curse and its effects.  The curse can be removed by nailing the strix to a wooden door, dead or alive, with an iron nail.  The curse also ends if the strix curses another creature with its talons.
