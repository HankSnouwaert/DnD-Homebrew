## Screechers of Change


Screechers of change are demons who've earned their names by the terrifying screeches they unleash as they soar through the sky toward their prey. They take the form of immense, airborne manta rays twisted by unnatural mutations. Their bodies glide effortlessly through the skies, and the edges of their expansive wings are lined with razor-sharp fins capable of slicing through armor and flesh with ease. Their wide mouths are filled with rows of serrated teeth, ready to rend both the physical and aetheric forms of their victims.

These creatures operate on instinct and are attracted to the aetheric energies generated by magic and intense emotions. Whether it's a sorcerer channeling arcane powers, a battlefield charged with fury and fear, or places steeped in lingering magical residue, all serve as beacons to the screechers. Upon sensing such energies, they become relentless hunters, diving from the heavens with terrifying speed and precision. They not only inflict grievous physical wounds but also consume the very essence of their prey, feeding on the aetheric energy that sustains them.

When forces of demonic change mobilize for war, screechers of change are never far behind. The tumult of conflict amplifies the energies they crave, providing a veritable feast. Their eerie, piercing screeches reverberate across the battlefield, sowing fear and chaos among friend and foe alike. As they soar over the clamor of war, they single out the most potent sources of aetheric energy, be it mighty spellcasters or warriors engulfed in emotion, further fueling the cycle of destruction.

Embodiments of insatiable hunger and perpetual metamorphosis, screechers of change grow more unpredictable and dangerous with every essence they consume. The chaotic energies they absorb drive their own continual transformation, resulting in ever more fearsome mutations. The sight of their dark silhouettes blotting out the sun is an omen of upheaval, signaling that the forces of change are in motion and that few will escape their ravenous pursuit.

***Thunderous Screechers.*** Among the various mutant variants of the screechers, thunderous screechers are especially dreaded. This formidable variant possesses the ability to project magical sonic blasts as they glide through the air. With each movement, they harness aetheric energies to emit concussive waves of sound that can shatter stone and rupture eardrums. Thunderous screechers use this power to amplify the chaos of battle. Their approach is often preceded by a rising cacophony, an ominous symphony that heralds the havoc they are about to unleash. In the midst of conflict, their sonic blasts can turn the tide by sending their foes flying with waves of thunderous energy, making them unpredictable forces of devastation on any battlefield.

### Discs of Change

Discs of change are screechers that powerful demons or sorcerers have transformed to serve as flying, demonic mounts. Through arcane rituals and dark enchantments, these beings are reshaped into flattened, iridescent disks adorned with swirling, otherworldly patterns. This metamorphosis harnesses the chaotic essence of the screechers, converting them into obedient steeds for the most devoted followers of transformation.

Retaining their razor-sharp fins along the edges, discs of change glide through the air with remarkable speed and agility. Riders stand atop them, seamlessly connected through a fusion of willpower and mastery over shifting aetheric energies. This bond allows for swift aerial maneuvers and assaults from unexpected angles, giving their riders a significant advantage in combat.


On the battlefield, riders of discs of change can bypass terrain obstacles, execute surprise attacks, and retreat with unparalleled swiftness. From their elevated positions, they unleash spells or ranged attacks, spreading fear and confusion among enemy ranks. The mere sight of these airborne warriors mounted on their eerie disks instills dread, symbolizing the intentional harnessing of chaos by those who command it.

***Discs of Immolation.*** Discs of immolation are an even more fearsome variant of the discs of change, specifically enhanced by powerful demons or sorcerers to unleash jets of searing warpfire upon foes below. These demonic mounts retain the swift agility and razor-edged fins of their predecessors but are imbued with the ability to channel chaotic flames. As they soar over battlefields, they rain down torrents of warpfire that can incinerate all in their path. The warpfire they emit is not ordinary flame; it is infused with chaotic energy that twists and mutates its victims. Riders of these fiery disks harness this destructive power to devastating effect, turning the skies into a blazing panorama of chaos and destruction.

### Burning Chariots of Change

Chariots of change are awe-inspiring and fearsome war machines employed by the most powerful agents of transformation. These magical flying chariots are typically pulled by screechers of change, bound through arcane rituals to serve the will of their masters. As they soar through the skies, they leave behind trails of burning warpfire, casting an eerie, otherworldly glow that illuminates the heavens. From a distance, they appear as ominous comets blazing across the firmament, heralding upheaval and chaos. The warpfire not only serves as a visual spectacle but also acts as a weapon, scorching anything unfortunate enough to be caught beneath their fiery wake. Riders of these chariots command immense power, using their elevated position to unleash spells, direct forces, and sow disorder among enemy ranks. 

### Screecher of Change Tactics
Screechers will disengage if they can move past three or more targets. They will attack if they can avoid effective opportunity attacks, targeting creatures with high AC or large size.

#### Thunderous Screecher
Thunderous Screechers follow similar tactics but prioritize flying past melee fighters when disengaging. They may save their bite attack for creatures capable of making effective opportunity attacks. They will use *thunderwave* if it can hit three or more targets or help it avoid opportunity attacks.

#### Discs of Change
Discs of Change serve as mounts for spellcasters and use their high mobility to target enemies with high AC, though the disc itself deals minimal damage with its attacks.

\columnbreak

##### Discs of Immolation
Discs of Immolation do not stay in prolonged combat. They fly in to attack, recharge their Searing Torment, and then fly back out of reach.

## Chariot Rules

Chariots are vehicles that can be pulled by one or more creatures, referred to as their steeds, and allow one or more riders to reside within their carriage, though only one rider controls the chariot and is referred to as the charioteer. The charioteer must have proficiency with land vehicles to control the chariot. Charioteers and the chariot's steeds follow the mounted combat rules described in the Player's Handbook, but with the following differences:

### Movement & Initiative

* **Mounting & Dismounting.** Mounting or dismounting a chariot costs a creature 5 feet of movement rather than a number of feet equal to half its speed. 

* **Forced Movement.** If an effect moves a chariot or any of its steeds, the chariot and each of its steeds are all moved together.

* **Movement in Unison.** The chariot's steeds must all move in unison and cannot move the chariot further than the steed with the least available movement can.

* **Controlled Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are being used as controlled mounts and there is more than one, they all act on the same initiative and must take the same action on their turn.

* **Independent Mounts.** If the chariot's steeds are acting independently, they all share the same initiative of the steed with the lowest initiative. They may take their actions in any order but must move together.

### Chariot Saving Throws
Chariots equipped with one or more unencumbered steeds do not automatically fail their Strength and Dexterity saving throws. Their bulkiness can either work for or against them depending on the type of save. 

#### Strength Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Strength saving throw, all its steeds must make a Strength saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds succeed on the save, the chariot passes the save, as those steeds manage to hold the chariot steady.

#### Dexterity Saves
If a chariot is subjected to a Dexterity saving throw, all its steeds must make a Dexterity saving throw against the effect. Any steeds being subjected to the same effect use the results of the roll they made for themselves. If any steeds fail on the save, the chariot fails the save, as they must all effectively coordinate to pull the chariot out of harm's way.

## Chariot Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, chariots have the following additional attributes:

### Max Speed
This is the maximum speed the chariot can be pulled at, regardless of the speeds of its steeds.

### Steed Capacity
This is the number of steeds that can pull the chariot at once and the required sizes of those creatures. 

### Carriage Capacity
This is the number and size of the creatures the chariot's carriage can hold. Creatures smaller or larger than the sizes listed won't be able to control the chariot. 

### Constitution Modifier
This is the modifier the chariot adds to any Constitution saves it makes. 

### Challenge Rating
If the players are facing enemies equipped with a fully functioning chariot, the CR of the encounter should be calculated as though the chariot is an additional creature with this CR.

### Passive Traits
These are any traits the chariot has that don't require actions from the steeds or rider to utilize.

### Steed Actions
These are new action options the chariot grants to its steeds. The steeds may use these options even if they are being used as controlled mounts.

### Screecher of Change Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check.  

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Screecher of Change Loot Tables
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.


##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
