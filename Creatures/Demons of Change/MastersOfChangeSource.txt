## Masters of Change

Masters of change are terrifying embodiments of deceit, manipulation, and reality-warping sorcery. Towering above most beings, they appear as large, anthropomorphic birds with immense, feathered wings that shimmer with otherworldly colors. Their long, vulturous necks often twist and crane unnaturally, ending in cruel, sharp beaks that seem to glisten with malice. Masters of change are notorious for their physical unpredictability, as their bodies are riddled with mutations. Some boast additional limbs or elongated talons, while others possess two or more heads, each whispering secrets of ancient power. These deformities only enhance their aura of chaos, making it clear that they are beings not bound by the laws of reality.

As fiendish masterminds, masters of change spend every moment of their existence pursuing forbidden knowledge and plotting their convoluted schemes. Their intelligence is vast, and their hunger for power is insatiable. They weave grand, labyrinthine schemes that span centuries, using mortals as mere pawns in their games. By playing on the desires, fears, and ambitions of lesser beings, these demons subtly guide the actions of kings, wizards, and heroes, all the while maintaining the illusion that their followers are acting on their own volition. In reality, the mortals who believe they have been granted knowledge and power to achieve their dreams are little more than unwitting pieces in the master of change’s intricate, multiverse-spanning play.

The magical prowess of a master of change is unrivaled. Their deep connection to the fundamental weave of magic allows them to perceive, manipulate, and reshape it with almost no effort. To them, the weave of magic is no more difficult to navigate than the strings of a harp are to a seasoned musician. This innate talent makes them some of the most powerful spellcasters in existence, capable of bending reality to their will. They specialize in spells of mutation, illusion, and chaos, using their abilities to disrupt the natural order and further their inscrutable plans. Few mortal mages can hope to stand against their overwhelming magical presence.

Exalted masters of change are even more terrifying, rare beings among their kind that have ascended to levels of power unfathomable to most. These exalted versions are often marked by an even greater array of mutations, and their magical control extends far beyond the material world allowing them to twist all types of magic into tools at their disposal. Capable of shaping entire realms and bending time and space, they are the very essence of change and chaos. When an exalted master of change appears, the natural order itself recoils in horror, for these beings represent the absolute peak of demonic influence, and even the mightiest gods are forced to take note of their schemes.

### Powers of Change

The master of change can have two of the following traits (it has Capricious Warpflame and Twin Focus by default):

**Capricious Warpflame.** Fire damage dealt by the master ignores fire resistance. If the master hits a creature with an attack that deals fire damage or if the creature fails a saving throw against a spell cast by the master by 5 or more, the creature suffers a mutation (Mutation Save DC 21) (mutated condition described later in document).

**Duplicitous Simulacrum.** The master can use a bonus action to create a simulacrum copy of itself in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet. The simulacrum lasts until it is more than 100 feet away from the master, or until another simulacrum is created. When the simulacrum is created, the master can seamlessly swap places with it.

The simulacrum shares the same initiative count as the master but can take its turn before or after the master. The simulacrum is an exact copy of the master, except it cannot take any actions on its turn, has 25 hit points, and loses the ability to cast spells. The master can make attacks and cast spells as if it were in the simulacrum’s space, using the simulacrum's senses, making it appear as if the simulacrum made the attack or cast the spell.



**Read Fate.** When the master rolls initiative or at the end of each of its turns, it can choose one creature within 120 feet that it is aware of and glimpse into its future. Until the end of the master's next turn, the master has advantage on all attacks made against that creature, and the creature has disadvantage on all attacks it makes against the master. Once the master uses this feature on a creature, that creature is immune to the effects of this ability for the next hour.

**Twin Focus.** The master can maintain concentration on two spells simultaneously. If it fails a concentration save while concentrating on two spells, it loses concentration on one of the spells of its choice.

### The Golden Master

Unlike other masters of change, this demon has a nearly regal bearing. His aven form is crisp and clean, and his feathers have a shining metallic quality to them. He wears an ornate garb with countless precious metals woven through it and carries a magnificent staff whose apparent cost could bankrupt a nation. From behind his golden mask, he promises any who will listen the means to obtain wealth beyond their wildest dreams. For this master of change has found a unique specialization that sets him apart from his kind: financial manipulation.

While all masters of change develop schemes that exploit mortal weakness, The Golden Master has found money to be one of the most effective ways to accomplish this. Money is an abstraction of wealth and, through financial manipulation, can quickly become divorced from tangible material value. The Golden Master excels at adding layers of complexity to large financial systems, making them increasingly convoluted, dysfunctional, and easier to exploit.

When The Golden Master influences mortals, he shows them how to twist and exploit markets to their advantage, developing new and inventive ways to subvert their intended function for selfish gain. These schemes range from simple pyramid schemes to the elaborate over-financialization of an entire nation's economy. While those who heed The Golden Master's influence reap massive economic gains, their success is unsustainable, as their methods eventually undermine the economy to the point of collapse.

  At this point, the illusion of their wealth becomes apparent as the elaborate conceptual monetary system disintegrates and their financial games become for naught.

The Golden Master's focus on wealth has resulted in his specialization in alchemical spellcraft. He is a master of transmutation and capable of conjuring seemingly precious metals. However, these creations are all faux metals, useless for any practical applications, and only bearing the superficial appearance of value.

This metallic magic is hardly limited to the creation of useless currencies; when pressed into direct confrontations, The Golden Master can unleash magical fires that cover his foes in molten gold. Many ruined merchants have met their end buried under waves of searing gold while attempting to exact vengeance on the demon who manipulated them. 

The searing gold has a perverse sentience of its own, and should it be scrapped off, it will quickly form into a demonic entity in service to The Golden Master. These golden terrors are a metallic variant of other demonic terrors of change and serve as The Golden Master's primary minions. When an entire kingdom experiences devastating financial collapse, there are sometimes those who learn of the culprit and seek the demon for vengeance, and in such cases, The Golden Master unleashes his metallic minions and searing magics to ensure all pay the price of avarice.

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |Over the past few days, a town has been subjected to an increasing number of mutations and magical anomalies, all heralding a **master of change's** arrival.|
|  2  |A scheming vizier has begun consulting with a **master of change**, unaware that the demon is using him to steer the course of the entire kingdom.    |
|  3  |An entire city has descended into madness, its grip on reality bleeding away as warped demons spill across the streets while a **master of change** flies overhead, orchestrating the grand show.     |

### Masters of Change Tactics

Masters of Change make decisions with near-perfect knowledge of the enemy's capabilities. They cast the following spells based on situational need:

**Banishment**: Use if Dominate Monster has already been used.

**Bolt of Change:** Cast when AoE options are limited, and concentration is already used. Prioritized over Banishment if it has advantage on the attack roll.

**Counterspell:** Reactions are reserved to use this to disrupt enemy spells.

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when wounded (below 50 HP).

**Dispel Magic:** Cast when a high-level spell prevents it from acting.

**Dominate Monster:** Cast when there aren’t enough targets for AoE spells, and concentration is free.

**Fireball:** Cast when two or more low-Dexterity targets or three total targets are present, and concentration is already used.

**Firestorm:** Cast when three or more low-Dexterity targets or four total targets can be hit.

**Firewall:** Cast when two or more low-Dexterity targets or three total targets can be hit.

**Glean Magic:** Cast when no AoE spells are viable, and it’s concentrating on another spell.

**Invisibility:** Used for ambushes or if unable to teleport to safety.

**Prismatic Spray:** Same conditions as Firestorm.

#### Exalted Masters of Change Tactics

Exalted masters of change have access to the Lore Strike legendary action and can use the following guidelines when deciding which lore to use:

**Fire:** The strongest option, especially with Warp Flame.

**Light:** Used on targets it plans to attack next turn.

**Beast:** Used when forced into melee and unable to escape.

**Metal and Life:** Pushes or pulls creatures into a *firewall* spell.

**Heavens:** Used on spellcasters concentrating on 4th-level or higher spells.

**Shadow:** Targets creatures more than 60 feet away.

**Death:** Targets low-HP creatures for potential knockouts on the next turn.

#### The Golden Griffin Tactics
The Golden Griffin has different spells compared to other Masters of Change and uses them with the following strategies in mind:

**Bolt of Change:** Cast when AoE spells aren’t effective, and the Griffin is already concentrating on other spells. This spell is prioritized over Banishment if it has advantage on the attack roll.

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when the Griffin is badly wounded (below 50 HP).

**Dispel Magic:** Used when a spell is preventing the Griffin from taking its full action.

**Dominate Monster:** Cast when there aren't enough targets for AoE spells, and the Griffin is not concentrating on the maximum number of spells. It will attempt to hit the creature with its staff before casting this spell.

**Final Transformation:** Targeted at spellcasters, preferably those who cannot cast Greater Restoration.

**Firestorm:** Cast when it can hit three or more targets with low Dexterity or four targets overall.

**Fire Wall:** Cast when it can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity or three targets overall.

**Glean Magic:** Cast when there are not enough AoE targets, and the Griffin is already concentrating on a spell. Targets for Bolt of Change may also be selected.

**Molten Silver:** Used when it can hit two or more low-Dexterity targets or three targets overall, and the Griffin is already concentrating on the maximum number of spells.

**Plague of Rust:** Used to target the weapons of martial classes when there aren't enough AoE targets and the Griffin is concentrating on spells.






**Invisibility:** Utilized for ambushing, or when the Griffin cannot teleport away to safety.

##### Legendary Actions
The Golden Griffin uses its Golden Bolt as frequently as possible. It uses Searing Gold whenever there are multiple targets covered in gold.

## New Spells & Conditions

#### Bolt of Change
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation (condition described at end of document).

#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

\columnbreak

#### Final Transmutation

*9th-level transmutation*


- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bar of lead)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 10 minutes
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard, Warlock
___

You speak a word of power that transforms a creature you can see within range. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it is petrified, turning to gold until the spell ends. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

**Ending The Effect.** A petrified target can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell, it remains petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become obsessed* with the petrified creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

**Damaging A Petrified Creature.** If a petrified creature is physically damaged or broken during this state, it will manifest the same damage upon being reverted to its original form.

#### Plague of Rust

*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of gold thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\pagebreakNum

#### Molten Silver

*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A small piece of sliver)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Artificer
___

A line of searing liquid silver up to 30 feet long and 5 feet wide emanates from you in a direction you choose. At the end of the line, the silver spreads out into a 30-foot cone emanating in the direction of the line. Each creature in the line or cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6 bludgeoning damage; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

### Master of Change Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Master of Change Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
