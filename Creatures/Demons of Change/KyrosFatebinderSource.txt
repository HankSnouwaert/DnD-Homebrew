## Kyros Fatebinder

Kyros Fatebinder is a two-headed master of change, regarded as the most powerful and enigmatic of his kind. Kyros Fatebinder's power was always great, but it was after a cataclysmic event that he transcended even the limits of demonic existence. Cast into an eternal, formless realm beyond space and time—an expanse where even gods fear to venture—Kyros Fatebinder was left to wander the madness of the void. When he eventually returned, he was irrevocably changed.

Now, Kyros Fatebinder’s two heads grant him extraordinary sight. His left head can perceive the entirety of the past, down to every insignificant detail, with perfect clarity. He can unravel the threads of history, understanding every cause and effect that has ever unfolded. His right head, on the other hand, peers into the endless possibilities of the future, tracing potential outcomes and paths as effortlessly as breathing. This dual perception makes him a living repository of cosmic knowledge, able to foresee events and recall ancient truths that no other being could comprehend.

Yet, this incredible gift comes with a curse. Neither of his heads can perceive the present. Trapped between the certainty of the past and the infinite possibilities of the future, Kyros Fatebinder cannot truly experience the moment he exists in. Instead, he must infer his current place in time by comparing what has been to what will be.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

This unique limitation drives him to calculate every move with unparalleled precision, as his actions must be shaped by his perfect understanding of what came before and what may come after.

Within his demonic realm, Kyros Fatebinder sits as an oracle of dark knowledge. He whispers secrets gleaned from the maddening depths of the place that once consumed him, and lesser masters of change flock to his side, eager to collect the forbidden insights he offers. They circle him like moths drawn to flame, knowing that even a single word from Kyros Fatebinder might unlock powers they could scarcely dream of. These whispers spread across realms, and his influence expands, despite his isolation, as those who crave power come to listen to his cryptic prophecies.

When Kyros Fatebinder leaves his realm, it is never for trivial reasons. He ventures forth only to orchestrate the grandest of schemes, using his unparalleled vision of the past and future to manipulate the world toward his inscrutable goals. To him, every event is but a piece of a vast, multiversal puzzle, and he is the only one who understands the shape it must take. His spells are as varied as the knowledge he holds, effortlessly cast to manipulate fate, twist reality, and reshape the destiny of all who stand in his way. To oppose Kyros Fatebinder is to fight against the very fabric of time and reality itself.

### Kyros Fatebinder's Lair
Kyros Fatebinder is makes his lair in archives of eldridge knowledge and power. These temporary locations range from arcane libraries to grand observatories or long-forgotten crystalline fortresses. Wherever he settles, it doesn't take long for the intensity of Kyros Fatebinder's presence to twist his new surroundings, causing reality to fray.


#### Regional Effects
Any region where Kyros Fatebinder dwells for a significant amount of time becomes warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects within 5 miles of his lair:

* Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 8 or higher that can speak at least one language finishes a long rest in the area, it may cast either the *commune* or *legend lore* spell once, using Intelligence as its spellcasting modifier, while it remains in the area.
* Kyros Fatebinder becomes aware of any information gained through the use of divination spells cast in the area.
* If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into madness, as determined by the Madness of Fateweaver table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

##### Madness of Fateweaver
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |I obsess over future events, constantly trying to manipulate circumstances to achieve my desired outcomes. |
|  2  | I am infatuated with past events, needing to understand every painful detail of what happened. |
|  3  | I become overwhelmed by choices and their potential future consequences, often feeling paralyzed when it's time to make a decision. |
|  4  | I obsess over past events, replaying them over and over in my mind. |

#### Lair Actions
While in his lair, Kyros Fatebinder's challenge rating increases by 5.

When Kyros Fatebinder rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or Kyros Fatebinder dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 25 and can act on its own accord, always acting in Kyros Fatebinder's best interest. While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair casts one of the spells listed below. 

\columnbreak

A spell cast this way ends on initiative count 20 of the next turn, and the lair can't cast the same spell again (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks) for the next hour.

* Bestial Spirit (6th level)
* Flame Cage
* Horrifying Laughter
* Net of Light
* Pit of Shadows
* Plague of Rust (6th level)
* Storm Sphere (6th level)
* Wall of Thorns

### Epic Fateweaver Battle
If you wish to make Kyros Fatebinder into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 804 hit points, and give him the Chaos Caster ability. This increases his CR to 28.

***Chaos Caster (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If Kyros Fatebinder is reduced to half his hit points (402) or less, he may end any effects incapacitating or preventing him from casting spells. Both heads may then immediately cast *chaos storm* without any components (no action required). Both heads are concentrating on the spell and can use their actions to open gates. The spell only ends once both heads have stopped concentrating on the spell.

### Exiled One Adventure Hooks
The following adventure hooks can provide you with some ways to include The Exiled One in your campaigns.

##### The Exiled One Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Past Undone.** Powerful enemies the players defeated in their past return, claiming they were never truly vanquished. The players discover Kyros Fatebinder altered the timeline, and they must confront him to restore the true past.|
|  2  | **The Vanishing Present.** The players find themselves in a world where the present moment keeps disappearing, flickering between realities. As they investigate, they realize Kyros Fatebinder is experimenting with time, and they must confront him to stabilize their world. |
|  3  | **Future Proofed.** The players discover a prophecy of an impending disaster orchestrated by Kyros Fatebinder. They must locate him and prevent the event, but their every action seems to align with his grand plan. |
|  4  | **Stolen Sight.** An oracle’s visions have vanished, stolen by Kyros Fatebinder in an attempt to see the present. The players must retrieve her power by venturing into his chaotic realm and navigating its ever-shifting reality. |

The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

### Kyros Fatebinder Tactics

Kyros Fatebinder's two heads—Right Head and Left Head—have distinct spell selections. The Right Head always acts before the Left Head. Kyros Fatebinder typically attempts to hit a target with his staff before casting spells.

#### Right Head

&emsp;**Plague of Rust:** Cast when it can affect three or more magical weapons belonging to martial classes.

**Net of Light:** Cast when it can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity saving throws, setting up future AoE spells by giving disadvantage on Dexterity saves.

**Wall of Thorns:** Used when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Storm Sphere:** This spell can be used more generally, and both heads can use the bonus action associated with Storm Sphere.

**Dimensional Warp:** Can be used to escape from combat or, preferably, reposition enemies into dangerous spell areas.

#### Left Head
&emsp;**Pit of Shadows:** Cast when it can hit two or more low-Dexterity targets or disrupt spellcasters concentrating on spells.

**Flame Cage:** Used when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Wall of Thorns:** Cast under the same conditions as the Right Head, when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Horrifying Laughter:** Targets a creature with a low Wisdom saving throw and within range of two other creatures.

#### Both Heads

&emsp;**Chromatic Orb:** Used when either head is concentrating on a spell

**Glean Magic:** Cast when there aren’t enough AoE targets, the Fatebinder is already concentrating on a spell, and there is not clear target for Chromatic Orb

**Dispel Magic:** Cast when a spell is preventing Kyros Fatebinder from taking its full actions

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when Kyros Fatebinder is badly wounded (below 50 HP)

**Invisibility:** Utilized for ambush tactics or when Kyros Fatebinder cannot teleport to safety

#### Lair Actions

Kyros Fatebinder's lair utilizes its spells in the same strategic way that Kyros Fatebinder would, aiding his efforts during battle.

#### Epic Encounter Tactics 
During an epic encounter, Kyros Fatebinder prioritizes using his actions to open portals with *chaos storm*.

### Fateweaver Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### Kyros Fatebinder Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Kyros Fatebinder Loot Table

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 | Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1d4(2) 20,000gp Items |
|  10-14 | 1d6(3) 20,000gp Items | 
|  15-25 | 1 100,000gp Item  |  
|  26+ | 1d4(2) 100,000gp Items |  


#### Example Fateweaver Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Legendary/Mythic Demon of Change Item Names
|1d10 | 20,000gp Item | 100,000gp Item
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1-2 <br> (Bone)  |  Warping Greater God Bone | Fateweaver's Skull |

| 7-8 (Hide)  |  Scintillating Greater God Feathers | Fateweaver's Wing |
| 9-10 <br> (Metal) | Masterwork Divine Armaments | Fateweaver's Armaments |

### New Spells

#### Bestial Spirit

*4th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 40 feet
- **Components:**  V
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.


***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Flame Cage
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A small piece of phosphorus)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

You choose a point on a solid surface within range, causing a cage made of opaque flames in the shape of a cube to appear. The cube can be up to 30 feet on each side, and it lasts for the duration. 

**Creatures Caught Partially Within the Cage.** When the cage is created, creatures only partially within the cube's area, or those too large to fit inside the area, must choose to be pushed away from the center of the area until they are completely outside the area or move into the cage if they can fit. 

**Creatures In The Cage When It Forms.** Any creature fully within the cage when it forms (including those that chose to move inside it) must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 7d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

**Moving Through The Cage.** A creature takes the 7d8 fire damage when it passes through a side of the cube for the first time on a turn.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.

\columnbreak

#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

#### Net of Light
*5th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V S M (A white thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute.
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Paladin

You weave a radiant web of binding light at a location you can see within range. This web encompasses a 20-foot cube and lingers for the spell's duration, shedding bright light throughout the area and turning it into difficult terrain.

When a creature starts its turn within the web or enters the web during its turn, it must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained and blinded for as long as it remains in the web or until it manages to break free.



\pagebreakNum

#### Pit of Shadows
*6th-level abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black cloth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

#### Plague of Rust
*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of gold thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\columnbreak

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.


##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
