# Demons of Change
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness but are as manipulative and deceitful as the demons of change.  These demons are born from the mortal desire to lie and distort the world around them.  These demons are the antithesis of truth and stability, continually changing themselves and the world around them in maddening ways.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to warp and manipulate humanoids.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of deceit and manipulation.  

**The Illusion of Reality.**  For demons of change, truth and reality are simply concepts to be twisted a manipulated.  The only constant in the multiverse is change, and no fact or certainty can withstand reality's constant metamorphosis.  All of existence is in a neverending state of becoming, and demons of change fully embrace this chaos.  They communicate in entirely contradictory ways, lying with every breath and constantly calling the knowledge and beliefs of others into question.  The psychological instability they induce extends to the material world, and a demon of change's presence destabilizes reality, causing objects to twist and bend in impossible ways.

**Architects of Fate.**  The pliable nature of reality leads demons of change to see it as something to be manipulated like a marionette.  They are schemers and manipulators, always looking for ways to bend fate in their favor.  They often tempt mortals with knowledge and hidden insights into the nature of reality, but these ploys are always manipulation serving a larger scheme.  These schemes are multilayered, with each lie part of a larger plot and each plot a piece of a grand conspiracy.  No matter how many layers of deceit are pulled back, there are still more manipulations at play, and attempting to understand how they all play into each other can drive a mortal mind mad.  Whether these schemes serve some grand plan or they are manipulation for manipulation's sake remains a mystery.

**Arcane Masters.**  Demons of change have an intrinsic connection to the nature of magic.  In many ways, magic is the epitome of what they represent.  Magic manipulates reality to defy natural law, making the universe's rules ever more incomprehensible.  Even the lowliest demons of change can channel this arcane chaos to some extent, and the greatest among them are some of the mightiest mages in existence.  The magic these fiends wield is chaos in its purest form, and nothing it touches is safe from its reality-warping effects.  Mortals who attempt to study it risk subjecting their bodies to arcane mutations and their minds to a whirlwind of insanity.

>
> **Capricious Warpflame** Fire damage dealt by the flamer ignores fire resistance. Additionally, the first time a creature takes fire damage from the flamer each turn, it must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers a randomly determined effect from the Mutation Table. If the resulting mutation is already affecting the target, it suffers no new effects. At the end of the target's turns, it makes a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, ending all mutations affecting it on a success. 
>
> *1. Wild Spasms.*  The target is incapacitated as its body jerks erratically in random directions. <Br> 
> *2. Degeneration.* The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage. <br>
> *3. Twisted Arms.*  The target's arms twist and turn in unnatural directions.  It can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components. <br>
> *4. Inverted Eyes.*  The target is blinded and has blindsight with a radius of 5 feet. <br>
> *5. Gelatinous Legs.*  The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight.   At the start of each of its turns, its legs give out, causing it to fall prone again.<Br>
> *6. Regeneration.*   The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The flamer makes three Hurl Flame attacks.
>
> ***Hurl Flame .*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +7 to hit, range 100 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (6d6) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The flamer casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):
>
> At will: *aganazzar's scorcher (4th level)*, *burning hands (5th level)*
>

**Flamers of Change.**  These bizarre demons are malevolent embodiments of magic and its chaotic nature.  Flamers of change float through the air, with gouts of fire erupting from where their legs would be, propelling them in any direction they desire.  Their bodies shimmer with hues of blue and purple while gnashing mouths and leering eyes are haphazardly strewn across their forms.  The only limbs to present are two long arms ending in twisted months.  Flamers derive their name from the chaotic fires that erupt from their mouths, known as war flame.  This warp flame is not true fire but chaos in its purest form and anything it touches is subjected to rapid mutation as the orderly laws of the multiverse are quickly broken down.

Flamers of change possess no guile and ambition of their own.  They are more akin to magical elementals than the other scheming demons of change.  Flamers might spawn in locations where other demons have wrought significant havoc on the fabric of reality.  Other times, powerful demons or deranged mortals summon flamers to sow chaos amongst their enemies.  Only the most powerful of wills can control a flamer of change, for once it is set loose upon the world, it cares for nothing but causing chaos for the sake of chaos.

**Horrors of Change.**  These unpredictable demons defy reason and understanding.  Horrors of change have no fixed form, and their bodies constantly writhe and twist into new shapes.  Faces appear and disappear while new limbs stretch out to propel the horror forward or grab at nearby enemies.  While these limbs can be used as potent weapons, the true threat from a horror comes from its innate magical abilities, which allow it to hurl devastating flames anyone and anything that strikes its fancy.

The primary incarnation of a horror of change is known as a pink horror as they are recognizable by their pinkish hue.   These fiends cackle with maniacal glee as they bound to and fro, burning and tearing apart whatever they please.  Their innate magical abilities are amplified when they gather in groups, allowing them to unleash devesting magical displays.  Nothing gratifies a pink horror more than seeing reality ripped apart in a show of chaotic magical destruction.  

Should a pink horror be slain, it will split into two blue horrors.  Unlike their giddy pink counterparts, blue horrors are sullen and irritable, blaming everything and everyone for their loss of status.  They vent their frustrations on their enemies, spitefully burning and tearing at anything they can.

The death of a blue horror still does not end the cycle of chaos, for they split into two brimstone horrors.  These small fiends are composed entirely of fire and spite.  Aware that they are the lowest ranking demons of change, they seek vengeance on the world, using what power they have to burn everything and everyone around them.

**Lords of Change.** These greater demons are masters of deceit and reality-shattering sorcery.  Lords of change appear to be large, anthropomorphic birds with massive wings and long, vulturous necks.  They often sport various mutations, with some even having two heads.  

These fiendish masterminds spend every hour of their existence gathering information and orchestrating grand schemes.  By playing on the hopes and ambitions of mortals, lords of change manipulate these lowly creatures like chess pieces on the great board of reality.  Mortal supplicants may believe they are being granted the knowledge to achieve their goals, but in truth, they are just puppets in a demon's intricate play.

The vast knowledge and innate magical nature of a lord of change make it one of the most powerful spell casters in the multiverse.  These fiends can perceive and manipulate the weave of magic as easily as a musician plays a favored instrument, and few mages can hope to compete with their mastery of spellcraft.

>
> ***Improved Spell Casting.*** When the lord of change casts a spell that requires it to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (such as counterspell or dispel magic), it adds its proficiency bonus to that ability check.

## Demons of Change in Your Adventures
The demons in this document are based on the daemons of Tzeench from the Warhammer franchise.  However, they can be adapted to fit any setting in which demons seek to manipulate mortals and distort reality.  In more traditional Dungeons and Dragons settings, they could even serve other demon lords such as Fraz-Urb'luu or the Demogorgon.  The following tables provide you with examples of ways to incorporate these demons into your adventures.
