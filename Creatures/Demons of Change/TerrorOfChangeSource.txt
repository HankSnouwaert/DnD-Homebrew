## Terrors of Change
These unpredictable demons defy reason and understanding.  Terrors of change have no fixed form, and their bodies constantly writhe and twist into new shapes.  Faces appear and disappear while new limbs stretch out to propel the terror forward or grab at nearby enemies.  While these limbs can be used as potent weapons, the true threat from a terror comes from its innate magical abilities, which allow it to hurl devastating flames anyone and anything that strikes its fancy.

The primary incarnation of a terror of change is known as a pink terror as they are recognizable by their pinkish hue.   These fiends cackle with maniacal glee as they bound to and fro, burning and tearing apart whatever they please.  Their innate magical abilities are amplified when they gather in groups, allowing them to unleash devesting magical displays.  Nothing gratifies a pink terror more than seeing reality ripped apart in a show of chaotic magical destruction.  

Should a pink terror be slain, it will split into two blue terrors.  Unlike their giddy pink counterparts, blue terrors are sullen and irritable, blaming everything and everyone for their loss of status.  They vent their frustrations on their enemies, spitefully burning and tearing at anything they can.

The death of a blue terror still does not end the cycle of chaos, for they split into two brimstone terrors.  These small fiends are composed entirely of fire and spite.  Aware that they are the lowest ranking demons of change, they seek vengeance on the world, using what power they have to burn everything and everyone around them.

***Sour Terrors.*** Some pink terrors develop a wicked sense of humor and begin taking a perverse joy in finding ways to pull deadly pranks on their victims. They continually seek horribly hilarious ways to bring an end to their enemies and are always seeking new means to do so. Those pink terrors that manage to amuse their masters this way may be granted the "sour gut blessing," a bizarre demonic gift that causes the terror to violently explode in a spray of sour demonic energy when slain.

&emsp;Because demons reform back on their home plain when slain, sour terrors bait enemies into slaying them where they can do the most damage with their sour bursts, much to the amusement of other demonic onlookers. Sour terrors compete with each other to see who can find the most comical situations to explode and will trade stories on their exploits when they reform back on their home plain. 

Once any surviving foes slay a sour terror and relieze their folly, it is to late, for the sour terror leaves behind two bursting blue terrors who will immediately seek out a similar end. Unlike their pink counterparts, these dour sours don't concern themselves with any form of elaborate prank and waste no time charging at their foes and detonating so they can get it over with.

***Chromatic Terrors.*** Demons of change can ascend to new and more powerful forms by absorbing vast amounts of arcane energy. Pink terrors that succeed in this may become the exalted variants of their kind, while brimstone terrors are so unstable they always violently combust in the attempt. Blue terrors occupy a middle-ground and can sometimes absorb vast magical energies without losing total cohesion. These terrors become arcane beings radiating scintillating light, barely holding their physical forms together.

These chromatic horrors continually seek out arcane energies to gorge on so they can maintain their precarious existence. When they find an overabundance of such energies, they may even spawn smaller prismatic terrors from theselves. Those attempting to fight chromatic horrors with spellcraft do so at their own peril, as the magical energies will almost certainly provide them the excess succor needed to spawn more vile demons.

***Exalted Pink Terrors.*** Most pink <br> terrors have short, chaotic lifespans. <br> Between the hazardous nature of their <br> home plane, their antics on the Material Plane, and <br> their unstable nature, most are split into blue horrors or dissolved back down into their base arcane energies in short order. Those few pink terrors that manage to maintain their cohesion long enough to survive many battles and absorb sufficient amounts of arcane power may ascend in power to become the "exalted" members of their kind. 

Exalted pink terrors have more stable forms than their ordinary kin, allowing them to channel greater amounts of magical power when making their arcane assaults.

What's more, they can even channel <br> this power and use it to empower their allies, <br> granting them increased magical capabilities.

***The Blazing Terrors.*** All demons of change are tethered to the twisting home plain of their demonic masters, and when slain, this tether pulls their essence back to this realm for reabsorbtion. However, on rare occations, an exalted pink terror may form a connection several magnitudes stronger, thus becoming a walking portal to the realm of demonic change. Whether this process is a gift from a demon lord or the result of a weird cosmic anomaly is unknown. 

\columnbreak


All that is known is that this connection allows the terror to channel a seemingly endless supply of arcane energy through the rift of blazing light it carries with it.

The rift these blazing terrors carry makes them valuable allies to other magic users and highly sought after by mad wizards seeking a source of infinite arcane energy. However, the rift they carry is as unstable as the terror, and most who greedily exploit this power source end up torn asunder by the infinite power within.

***Pink Terror Commanders.*** The most powerful and longest-lived of the pink terrors may eventually stabilize to the point that they develop a sense of individuality and become able to command others of their kind. These pink terrors are stable to the point that they no longer split into blue terrors when slain, and this stability allows them to form more cohesive thoughts and personalities, which in turn allows them to channel more sophisticated forms of magic. The lesser demons of this kind are known as iridescent terrors, while the most powerful are referred to as heralds of change and often carry out the will of powerful demon lords.

These commanders draw power from the warping effect of other demons of change and are able to use this power to augment the eldritch power of their kin. Using their weird power, they can regenerate and stabilize the forms of other demons, boost their magical abilities, or even recycle the aether of slain demons to create new terrors. The presence of these demonic commanders ensures their eldritch forces will be as powerful as they are unpredictable.

#### Locus of Change Abilities
The terrors who serve as commanders draw power from the chaotic winds of magic and pass that power onto the demons they lead. Every iridescent terror and herald of change has one of the following abilities.

***Locus of Abjuration.*** The terror and each demon of change within 30 feet of it gains 5 temporary hit points at the start of each of its turns.
 
 ***Locus of Evocation*** The terror and demons of change within 30 feet of it gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of their spells.

***Locus of Transmogrification*** Whenever the terror or a demon of change with a CR 1 or higher within 30 feet of the terror dies, a *brimstone terrors of change* appear in the unoccupied spaces closest to where the demon died.

##### Terrors of Change Adventures Hooks

| d10  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |A wizard aspiring to be an archvillain has conjured a horde of **pink terrors of change**, but so far, they have proven unreliable minions at best.  |
|  2  | An unknown magical anomaly is randomly causing people to vomit fully formed **blue terrors of change** without warning.|
|  3  | A botched alchemical experiment has created a swarm of **brimstone terrors of change** eager to burn the entire laboratory to the ground.|
|  4  | A group of **sour pink terrors of change** are competing to see who can find the most devastating and creative ways to self-destruct in a now terrified city. |
|  5  | **Blue terrors of change** have been raiding libraries and archives, stealing and devouring valuable texts. Each time one devours magical texts, it risks turning into a **chromatic terror of change**. |
|  6 |The seemingly random rampages of a group of **exalted pink terrors of change** are calculated strikes paving the way for a demon lord's grander scheme.|
|  7  |A wizarding college has begun capturing **blazing pink terrors of change** to use as arcane power sources for powerful spells, arrogantly assuming they can harness the demons without losing their minds or tearing apart reality.  |
|  8  |A wizard has captured an **iridescent terror of change** in hopes of learning arcane secrets from it, unaware that the fiend is manipulating him down a road to madness.    |
|  9  |A **herald of change** has begun hunting down magic users, tearing them asunder, and using their essence to create rifts, allowing more demons of change to enter the Material Realm.   |
|  10  | An army attempting to launch an assault into The Far Realm has returned transformed into different types of terrors of change, which now rampage across The Material Plane. |

### Terror of Change Tactics
Pink terrors should group together to maximize their Growing Flames trait, slowly advancing toward the enemy as they become wounded. When they split, the blue and brimstone terrors will move into melee range. Even unwounded pink terrors should move closer to keep benefitting from Growing Flames, as blue and brimstone terrors will still trigger this ability.

#### Sour and Bursting Terrors
Sour terrors follow the same tactics as pink and blue terrors, but will use Death Rush when they have 26 or fewer hit points, aiming to explode within the largest enemy group. Bursting terrors will use Death Rush if they can hit two or more targets.

\columnbreak

#### Chromatic and Prismatic Terrors
With high resistance to elemental damage and the Chromatic Spawning ability, chromatic and prismatic terrors will typically target non-spellcasters, who pose a greater threat.

#### Exalted Pink Terrors of Change
Exalted terrors can use the Arcane Mirth ability instead of attacking to empower a more powerful ally, such as an iridescent terror, or to reposition enemies away from advantageous spots.

#### Blazing Squealers
Blazing squealers can use both Conduit of Infinity and Greater Arcane Mirth to create devastating, high-accuracy attacks. If other blazing squealers or stronger demons are present, they will use these abilities to empower the stronger demon. Blazing squealers will only empower themselves if they have 40 or more hit points, as they likely won’t survive long enough to benefit otherwise.

#### Iridescent Terrors and Heralds of Change
These demons should be accompanied by other Demons of Change to benefit from their Locus ability. You can use the following guidelines when determining how to use their spells:

**Glean Magic:** Used immediately on the first full caster they see.

**Fireball/Fire Storm:** Cast if two targets with low Dexterity saves can be hit, or if three or more such targets can be hit before Glean Magic (NOTE: What do you mean before Glean Magic?).

**Bolt of Change:** Targets creatures with low Charisma saving throws. The odds of hitting should be boosted by weaker minions (e.g., Blue or Brimstone Terrors) using the Help action or an Exalted Terror using Arcane Mirth.


##### Locus of Change Abilities
&emsp;**Locus of Abjuration.**  The terror and its minions within the locus should use hit-and-run tactics, attempting to make sure they do not take too much damage in one turn. 

**Locus of Evocation.** Does not greatly affect the terror's tactics

**Locus of Transmogrification.** This locus is most dangerous when paired with swarms of other demons. The brimstone terrors spawned from this ability can be used to boost the terror's Growing Flames ability.

### Terrors of Change Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

In the case of terrors of change that split into smaller demons when slain, the players must slay all the lesser forms to gain the loot of the original demon.


#### Terrors of Change Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## New Spells

#### Bolt of Change
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d12 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers a mutation (condition described at end of document).

#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell of the same level the creature knows at random.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell of one level lower at random.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
