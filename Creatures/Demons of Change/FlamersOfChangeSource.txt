## Flamers of Change

These bizarre demons are malevolent embodiments of magic and its chaotic nature. Flamers of change float through the air, with gouts of fire erupting from where their legs would be, propelling them in any direction they desire. Despite their ability to float, they cannot truly fly; instead, they glide through the air while floating just above the surface of the ground.

Their bodies shimmer with hues of blue and purple while gnashing mouths and leering eyes are haphazardly strewn across their forms. The only limbs to present are two long arms ending in twisted months. Flamers derive their name from the chaotic fires that erupt from their mouths, known as warp flame. This warp flame is not true fire but chaos in its purest form, and anything it touches is subjected to rapid mutation as the orderly laws of the multiverse are quickly broken down.

Flamers of change possess no guile and ambition of their own. They are more akin to magical elementals than the other scheming demons of change. Flamers might spawn in locations where other demons have wrought significant havoc on the fabric of reality. Other times, powerful demons or deranged mortals summon flamers to sow chaos amongst their enemies.

Only the most powerful of wills can control a flamer of change, for once it is set loose upon the world, it cares for nothing but causing chaos for the sake of chaos.

***Exalted Flamers of Change.*** Some flamers of change are gifted with a greater spark of fiendish sentience by their demonic masters. These "exalted flamers" possess greater magical abilities and more potent warp flame capable of mutating even the hardiest of foes. This enhanced sentience also allows them to develop primitive personalities, and over time, many begin to take malicious glee in the chaos they cause. Some even learn to direct other lesser demons or utilize demonic steeds and chariots. These flamers become menaces in combat, covering the battlefield in huge swaths of warp flame as they hunt down their victims atop their twisted steeds.

### Flamers of Change Tactics

Flamers avoid stacking mutations on a single target and instead spread their attacks and spells across multiple enemies. They prioritize using Flame Blast on low-AC targets and cast spells when they can hit three or more targets or two with low Dexterity saves. Exalted Flamers only use *fireball* if they can hit one extra target, as it deals less damage than their other spells.

##### Flamer of Change Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Flamers of change** keep appearing at seemingly random locations to wreak havoc before disappearing as quickly as they arrived, and no one knows the cause.  |
|  2  |A magical experiment gone awry warped a group of wizarding students into **flamers of change** that now rampage through their university.  |
|  3  | In a desperate attempt to ward off an angry mob, a mad sorcerer has torn a hole in reality, unleashing a horde of **flamers of change**.   |
|  4  |  A demon lord has unleased **flamers of change** upon an unsuspecting settlement to study their effect on the Material Plane and its inhabitants.  |
|  5  | A crumbling portal sits in deep inside forgotten ruins.  It appears inactive, but occasionally a **flamer of change** will flit out from its threshold.|
|  6  |  An arcane staff offers enhanced magical abilities at the risk of being transformed into a **flamer of change**.|

### Flamer of Change Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.




#### Flamer of Change Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
