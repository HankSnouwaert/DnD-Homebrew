## The Fateweaver

The Fateweaver is a two-headed master of change, regarded as the most powerful and enigmatic of his kind. The Fateweaver's power was always great, but it was after a cataclysmic event that he transcended even the limits of demonic existence. Cast into an eternal, formless realm beyond space and time—an expanse where even gods fear to venture—The Fateweaver was left to wander the madness of the void. When he eventually returned, he was irrevocably changed.

Now, The Fateweaver’s two heads grant him extraordinary sight. His left head can perceive the entirety of the past, down to every insignificant detail, with perfect clarity. He can unravel the threads of history, understanding every cause and effect that has ever unfolded. His right head, on the other hand, peers into the endless possibilities of the future, tracing potential outcomes and paths as effortlessly as breathing. This dual perception makes him a living repository of cosmic knowledge, able to foresee events and recall ancient truths that no other being could comprehend.

Yet, this incredible gift comes with a curse. Neither of his heads can perceive the present. Trapped between the certainty of the past and the infinite possibilities of the future, The Fateweaver cannot truly experience the moment he exists in. Instead, he must infer his current place in time by comparing what has been to what will be.

This unique limitation drives him to calculate every move with unparalleled precision, as his actions must be shaped by his perfect understanding of what came before and what may come after.

Within his demonic realm, The Fateweaver sits as an oracle of dark knowledge. He whispers secrets gleaned from the maddening depths of the place that once consumed him, and lesser masters of change flock to his side, eager to collect the forbidden insights he offers. They circle him like moths drawn to flame, knowing that even a single word from The Fateweaver might unlock powers they could scarcely dream of. These whispers spread across realms, and his influence expands, despite his isolation, as those who crave power come to listen to his cryptic prophecies.

When The Fateweaver leaves his realm, it is never for trivial reasons. He ventures forth only to orchestrate the grandest of schemes, using his unparalleled vision of the past and future to manipulate the world toward his inscrutable goals. To him, every event is but a piece of a vast, multiversal puzzle, and he is the only one who understands the shape it must take. His spells are as varied as the knowledge he holds, effortlessly cast to manipulate fate, twist reality, and reshape the destiny of all who stand in his way. To oppose The Fateweaver is to fight against the very fabric of time and reality itself.

### The Fateweaver's Lair
The Fateweaver is makes his lair in archives of eldridge knowledge and power. These temporary locations range from arcane libraries to grand observatories or long-forgotten crystalline fortresses. Wherever he settles, it doesn't take long for the intensity of The Fateweaver's presence to twist his new surroundings, causing reality to fray.


#### Regional Effects
Any region where The Fateweaver dwells for a significant amount of time becomes warped by his magic, creating one or more of the following effects within 5 miles of his lair:

* Whenever a creature with an Intelligence of 8 or higher that can speak at least one language finishes a long rest in the area, it may cast either the *commune* or *legend lore* spell once, using Intelligence as its spellcasting modifier, while it remains in the area.
* The Fateweaver becomes aware of any information gained through the use of divination spells cast in the area.
* If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into madness, as determined by the Madness of Fateweaver table. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

##### Madness of Fateweaver
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |I obsess over future events, constantly trying to manipulate circumstances to achieve my desired outcomes. |
|  2  | I am infatuated with past events, needing to understand every painful detail of what happened. |
|  3  | I become overwhelmed by choices and their potential future consequences, often feeling paralyzed when it's time to make a decision. |
|  4  | I obsess over past events, replaying them over and over in my mind. |

#### Lair Actions
While in his lair, The Fateweaver's challenge rating increases by 5.

When The Fateweaver rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or The Fateweaver dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 25 and can act on its own accord, always acting in The Fateweaver's best interest. While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair casts one of the spells listed below. 

\columnbreak

A spell cast this way ends on initiative count 20 of the next turn, and the lair can't cast the same spell again (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks) for the next hour, or it can (NOTE: cant or can't?) cast a spell that one of The Fateweaver's heads is currently concentrating on.

* Bestial Spirit (6th level)
* Flame Cage
* Horrifying Laughter
* Net of Light
* Pit of Shadows
* Plague of Rust (6th level)
* Storm Sphere (6th level)
* Wall of Thorns

### Epic Fateweaver Battle
If you wish to make The Fateweaver into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 804 hit points, and give him the Chaos Caster ability. This increases his CR to 28.

***Chaos Caster (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the Fateweaver is reduced to half his hit points (402) or less, he may end any effects incapacitating or preventing him from casting spells. Both heads may then immediately cast *chaos storm* without any components (no action required). Both heads are concentrating on the spell and can use their actions to open gates. The spell only ends once both heads have stopped concentrating on the spell.

### Exiled One Adventure Hooks
The following adventure hooks can provide you with some ways to include The Exiled One in your campaigns.

##### The Exiled One Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Past Undone.** Powerful enemies the players defeated in their past return, claiming they were never truly vanquished. The players discover The Fateweaver altered the timeline, and they must confront him to restore the true past.|
|  2  | **The Vanishing Present.** The players find themselves in a world where the present moment keeps disappearing, flickering between realities. As they investigate, they realize The Fateweaver is experimenting with time, and they must confront him to stabilize their world. |
|  3  | **Future Proofed.** The players discover a prophecy of an impending disaster orchestrated by The Fateweaver. They must locate him and prevent the event, but their every action seems to align with his grand plan. |
|  4  | **Stolen Sight.** An oracle’s visions have vanished, stolen by The Fateweaver in an attempt to see the present. The players must retrieve her power by venturing into his chaotic realm and navigating its ever-shifting reality. |

Whenever a creature makes an attack against The Fateweaver, it can choose which head the creature targets (Note: who gets to choose?). On a hit, the chosen head can make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on its spell. Otherwise, its concentration can't be broken as a result of taking damage.

The chosen space must be on a surface or in a liquid that can support the target without the target having to squeeze.

### The Fateweaver Tactics

The Fateweaver's two heads—Right Head and Left Head—have distinct spell selections. The Right Head always acts before the Left Head. The Fateweaver typically attempts to hit a target with his staff before casting spells.

#### Right Head

&emsp;**Plague of Rust:** Cast when it can affect three or more magical weapons belonging to martial classes.

**Net of Light:** Cast when it can hit two or more targets with low Dexterity saving throws, setting up future AoE spells by giving disadvantage on Dexterity saves.

**Wall of Thorns:** Used when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Storm Sphere:** This spell can be used more generally, and both heads can use the bonus action associated with Storm Sphere.

**Dimensional Warp:** Can be used to escape from combat or, preferably, reposition enemies into dangerous spell areas.

#### Left Head
&emsp;**Pit of Shadows:** Cast when it can hit two or more low-Dexterity targets or disrupt spellcasters concentrating on spells.

**Flame Cage:** Used when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Wall of Thorns:** Cast under the same conditions as the Right Head, when it can hit three or more creatures and encircle another.

**Horrifying Laughter:** Targets a creature with a low Wisdom saving throw and within range of two other creatures.

#### Both Heads

&emsp;**Chromatic Orb:** Used when either head is concentrating on a spell.

**Glean Magic:** Cast when there aren’t enough AoE targets, but concentration is already active, and there is (NOTE: you mean isn't?) a clear target for Chromatic Orb.

**Dispel Magic:** Cast when a spell is preventing The Fateweaver from taking its full actions.

**Dimension Door:** Used to escape when The Fateweaver is badly wounded (below 50 HP).

**Invisibility:** Utilized for ambush tactics or when The Fateweaver cannot teleport to safety.

#### Lair Actions

The Fateweaver's lair utilizes its spells in the same strategic way that the Fateweaver would, aiding his efforts during battle.

#### Epic Encounter Tactics 
During an epic encounter, The Fateweaver prioritizes using his actions to open portals with *chaos storm*.

### Fateweaver Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


#### The Fateweaver Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### The Fateweaver Loot Table

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 | Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1d4(2) 20,000gp Items |
|  10-14 | 1d6(3) 20,000gp Items | 
|  15-25 | 1 100,000gp Item  |  
|  26+ | 1d4(2) 100,000gp Items |  


#### Example Fateweaver Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Legendary/Mythic Demon of Change Item Names
|1d10 | 20,000gp Item | 100,000gp Item
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1-2 <br> (Bone)  |  Warping Greater God Bone | Fateweaver's Skull |
| 3-4 <br> (Fluid)  | Warping Divine Blood | Fateweaver's Blood |
| 5-6 <br> (Flesh)  |  Warping Greater God Flesh | Fateweaver's Heart |
| 7-8 (Hide)  |  Scintillating Greater God Feathers | Fateweaver's Wing |
| 9-10 <br> (Metal) | Masterwork Divine Armaments | Fateweaver's Armaments |
