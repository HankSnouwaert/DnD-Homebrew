Hit: 9 (2d8) piercing damage plus 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, or 4 (1d8) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw against disease become infected, while infected whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. If the Target is still Infeccted, instantly transforms Plaguebearer. The transformation of the body can be undone only by a wish spell.
