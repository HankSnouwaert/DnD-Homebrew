## College of Elements NPCs

The following stat blocks can be used to describe non-player characters who are bards from the college of elements or have abilities similar to a bard from that college.  You can choose the stat block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC. 

<br><br><br><br><br>

To further customize your NPC, apply the racial traits of whichever humanoid race youâ€™ve chosen for it.  You can also replace any of its known spells with spells of an equivalent level from the sorcerer or bard spell lists.

> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Kinetic Artistry.*** The artist takes the dash action. When it takes this action, it chooses one of the following additional effects:
>
>**Cold.**  Until the end of the artist's turn, it can move across the surface of water as though it is harmless, solid ground. Additionally, when it leaves a space within 5 feet of a creature, it can force that creature to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone. A creature can be targeted by this ability only once each turn.
>
>**Fire.** Once before the end of the artist's turn, it can force each creature within 5 feet of itself to make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 6 (1d8 + 4) fire damage.
>
>**Lightning.**  Until the end of the artist's turn, it can move through the space of other creatures, and it does not provoke opportunity attacks. If it ends its turn inside a creature's space, the artist is pushed into the nearest unoccupied space.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Elemental Defense (4/Day)*** When another creature the artist can see within 60 feet makes a saving throw, that creature can roll a d8 and add the result to the save.  The creature also gains resistance to either cold, fire, or lightning damage (artist's choice) until the end of the turn.
