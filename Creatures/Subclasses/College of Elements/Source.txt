## College of Elements NPCs

The following stat blocks can be used to describe non-player characters who are bards from the college of elements or have abilities similar to a bard from that college.  You can choose the stat block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC. 

<br><br><br><br><br>

To further customize your NPC, apply the racial traits of whichever humanoid race youâ€™ve chosen for it.  You can also replace any of its known spells with spells of an equivalent level from the sorcerer or bard spell lists.

The spell also ends if you use your action to do anything other than attack or deal damage using this spell.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3th level or higher, the initial damage and automatic damage increase by 1d12 for every two slot levels above 1st.
