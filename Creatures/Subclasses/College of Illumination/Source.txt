## College of <br> Illumination NPCs

The following stat blocks can be used to describe <br> non-player character bards who are from the <br> college of illumination or have abilities similar <br> to a bard of that college.  You can choose the stat <br> block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC. <Br> To further customize your NPC, apply the racial <br> traits of whichever humanoid race you’ve chosen for it. You can also replace any of its known spells with spells of an equivalent level that are either from the bard spell list, deal radiant damage, or have a light radius.
