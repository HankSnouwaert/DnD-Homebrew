## Otherworldly Patron - The Cauldron: NPCs

The following stat blocks can be used to describe non-player character warlocks that have taken the pact of the cauldron or have abilities similar to a warlock with that pact.  You can choose the stat block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br>

To further customize your NPC, apply the racial traits of whichever humanoid race youâ€™ve chosen for it.  If the NPC has a spell list, you can also replace any of its known spells with spells of an equivalent level from the warlock or pact of the cauldron expanded spell lists.
