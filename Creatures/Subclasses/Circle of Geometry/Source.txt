## Circle of Geometry NPCs

The following stat blocks can be used to describe non-player character druids who follow the circle of geometry or have abilities similar to a druid of that circle.  You can choose the stat block that best aligns with the power level of the NPC. 

To further customize your NPC, apply the racial traits of whichever humanoid race youâ€™ve chosen for it.  You can also replace any of its known spells with spells of an equivalent level from the druid spell list.

#### Creating Fractal Creatures
If you wish you add fractal creatures to your adventures to accompany your geometric druids, you can apply the following traits to any beast to turn it into a fractal creature.

* Its creature type changes to elemental
* It is immune to disease, poison damage, and the exhausted, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, and unconscious conditions.
* All its attacks deal force damage
* It gains the Leyline Invocation feature described in the Geometry Druid stat block

> ***Velocity Shift.*** (3/Day) When a creature the druid sees starts its turn or moves into a space within 30 feet of it, it can force that creature to make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, which the creature can choose to fail.  On a failure, the creature is teleported to an unoccupied space of the druid's choice that it can see within 30 feet of itself.
>
>The druid can also use this feature if it sees a creature start its turn within or move into the space of a shape created by the Leyline Invocation feature of itself or an ally.  A creature teleported this way is moved to any location of the druid's choice within that shape.
