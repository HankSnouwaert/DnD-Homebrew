## Vermin Lords
These demonic rat beings serve as the avatars of their verminous demon lord. They tower above mortals, their twisted forms a mixture of rat, human, and fiendish features. Their heads are topped with mighty horns, and the flesh peels away from their rat-like skulls, revealing bone etched with demonic sigils. Their long, muscular limbs can wield massive weaponry, yet they are dexterous and nimble with their movements, able to dash across the battle and swiftly dismember foes in the blink of an eye. When not taking action, vermin lords are intensely twitchy and prone to pacing about with a rat-like restlessness. 

Mortal ratfolk regard vermin lords with a mixture of fear and reverence. They only summon these terrifying demons in the most significant of situations, such as when the machinations of their demon lord are in play. Vermin lords always hold the highest position of authority amongst ratfolk, who show them grudging subservience. As instruments of their demon lord’s will, they serve to guide his mortal pawns and ensure his schemes come to pass.

Vermin lords come in different variants, and the type of demon to step into the mortal world depends on its summoners and the needs of its verminous demon lord.





### Vermin Lord Corrupter

Vermin Lord Corrupter
These pestilent demons represent the virulent diseases unleashed into the world by their demonic rat lord. They are magical maladies shaped into a fiendish rat form, and where ever they roam, they leave plagues in their wake. They are most often summoned by those ratfolk who revel in disease and spreading sickness, and these vermin lords consider it their sacred duty to spread their master’s diseases across the mortal realm.

In combat, vermin lord corrupters unleash a slew of pestilent magics capable of rotting away most foes before they can even reach the demon. Those who attempt to engage it in melee combat will find themselves assaulted by waves of biting parasites whittling away their vitality. The vermin lord will then summon a pair of sickle blades to quickly dispatch its weakened and rotting enemies in short order.

### Vermin Lord Deceiver
These devious demons represent their demonic rat lord's cunning and duplicitous nature. They are shadowy fiends whose size and power belies the stealth and subtlety with which they can move and act, always lurking out of sight until an opportunity presents itself. Vermin lord deceivers are summoned when subtlety and guile are needed rather than conspicuous displays of force, and these cunning fiends manipulate enemy and ally alike to facilitate the schemes of their demon lord. They are most commonly served by assassin clans of ratfolk, and are supreme assassins themselves, able to stalk and slay even the most formidable and well-guarded of targets before disappearing into the shadows.

<br><br>

In combat, vermin lord deceivers utilize stealth and misdirection to attack from unexpected directions and prevent enemies from surrounding them. They prefer to attack from a distance, utilizing a massive throwing star capable of cutting a swath through armored soldiers before flying back into the demon’s claws. When engaging in melee combat, the vermin lord utilizes its deadly warpstiletto, a massive dagger the length of a man and capable of piercing through shield and armor alike.

### Vermin Lord Warbringer

These brutal demons represent their demonic rat lord’s arrogance and ferocity. They are the most common and most warlike of the vermin lords. Their awe-inspiring presence rallies the normally cowardly ratfolk and drives them into battle with bloody-minded ferocity. Warbringers revel in their effect on others, making dramatic entrances whenever possible and striking majestic poses before their followers. 

In battle, vermin lord warbringers will often initially lead from the back, driving their minions into the fray. When it comes time for them to join combat, they wield mighty war glaives capable of cleaving through swaths of enemy soldiers. Should the vermin lord fight a powerful foe, they will utilize a brutal spike-fist capable of inflicting horrendous wounds. These weapons are also useful for delivering underhanded strikes against already overwhelmed enemies. Regardless of the circumstances, when a warbringer slays a foe, it is always sure to do it in the most dramatic and gory way possible, leaving minions struck with awe and foes struck with terror.

### Vermin Lord Warpseer

These scheming demons represent their demonic rat lord’s plotting and manipulative nature. While all vermin lords scheme, warpseers carry out plots within plots within plots. All their actions serve to advance the inscrutable and long reaching schemes of their verminous master, and the world’s mortals are simply the tools through which they achieve their ends. They are most often summoned by other so-called “masterminds” among the ratfolk who serve the demonic rat god and require aid in carrying out his schemes.

Warpseers are aided in their plotting by the scryorbs they carry. These large crystal balls enable them to peer into a myriad of different futures and determine how each potential action can further their schemes. 

<br><br>

In dire circumstances, the warpseer can shatter the scryorb, unleashing all its mind-shattering knowledge at once. Creatures caught in its proximity will have their psyches torn apart as they are overwhelmed by the near-infinite possibilities they are suddenly exposed to.

However, these mighty fiends are rarely pushed to use such measures, for they wield arcane power beyond even their other vermin lord kin. While all vermin lords can channel magic, warpseers alone are capable of calling down bolts of arching lightning, hurling balls of fire, and unleashing earthquakes capable of leveling settlements.

>
> ***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The vermin lord has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
>
> ***Scry-orb.*** The vermin lord can perform a 1-hour ceremony to create a scry-orb from nothingness. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and any previous scry-orb is destroyed if it still exists. The scry-orb vanishes when the vermin lord dies. The scry-orb is a magic item, and while the vermin lord holds it, it is under the effects of the *foresight* spell. The scry-orb can be attacked while the vermin lord is holding it. It has AC 16 and 90 hit points and is immune to poison and psychic damage. Attacks against it have disadvantage if they are made from more than 5 feet away.

> ***Warpstorm.*** Whenever the vermin lord calls down lightning with the *call lighting* spell, it first creates another storm cloud centered on a point it can see within 60 feet of it.

>
> ***Shatter Scry-orb.*** The vermin lord throws its scry-orb at a point within 90 feet of it, causing it to shatter and unleash horrifying visions.

> ***Overwhelming Mass (2).*** The first time each turn that the swarm hits a creature with a weapon attack, it deals an extra 2 damage per each ally within 5 feet of the target that isn't incapacitated, up to a maximum of 6 extra damage.
>
> ***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a tiny rat. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes two attacks or one attack if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. 
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) piercing damage.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Scurry Away.*** When an enemy the swarm can see ends its turn, the swarm can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the swarm can only take the Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

##### Vermin Lord Adventures

| d8  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | A haughty and affluent noble thinking himself above the need to honor the gods has earned their ire in the form of a **vermin lord corruptor** who now unleashes waves of plagues and monstrous rats across his lands.  |
|  2  |  Multiple riverways are becoming corrupt and leaving thousands sickened. All the riverways lead back to the same brackish lake where a **vermin lord corrupter** amasses power. |
|  3  | Powerful religious figures are being assassinated by a **vermin lord deceiver** who desecrates their shrines and temples with tributes to its demonic rat lord.   |

|  6  |  A **vermin lord warbringer** is traveling from one ratfolk clan to another and subjecting each of their warlords. Should it carry out its mission, it will be in command of a near-unstoppable verminous army. |
|  7  | The players find a strange talisman which sometimes grants them visions of nearby monsters and potential treasures to be had. Little do they know it was planted for them to find by a **vermin lord warpseer** who is manipulating their actions to further its schemes.   |
|  8  | A criminal organization once ruled by a beholder has been taken over by a **vermin lord warpseer** who now leads the criminals as their de facto demon rat kingpin. |
