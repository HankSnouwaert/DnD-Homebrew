# Demons of Decay
Demons represent the dark, chaotic <br> impulses of humanity made manifest. <br> Different demons represent different <br> aspects of this darkness, but none are <br> as revolting as the demons of decay. <br>  These demons are born from the <br> tendency of mortals to neglect <br> themselves and the world they live in, thus allowing <br> disease and entropy to run their course unopposed. <br> In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to <br> spread plagues and decay.  On others, they act in service to <br> a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of rot and disease.   

**Unnatural Vitality.** Demons of decay are easily recognized by their bloated, rotting, disease-ridden forms.  The decaying nature of their bodies does not mean these fiends are fragile or easy to slay.  Demons of decay can shrug off incredible amounts of punishment relative to their size while their would-be slayers slowly succumb to terrible afflictions.  Many who worship these demons do so in hopes of gaining this unnatural vitality, even if it means subjecting themselves to horrific rot and disease.

**Cheerful Nihilists.**  Demons of decay represent the inevitable deterioration of all things.  Those who have succumbed to nihilism and apathy are especially vulnerable to their influence.  Yet, these demons and their followers are almost always jolly and cheerful.  They revel in the pointlessness of life and celebrate the perpetual state of rot to which existence is subject.  Those who worship these fiends often seek a means of escaping despair and fear of death, and by accepting the gifts of rot and disease, these worshippers cheerfully shed all their worries and woes.

**Promoters of Life.**  The dark irony of these fiends is their genuine love of life.  They hold a motherly love for all living things, including diseases and parasites, which they fail to see as any less important than other lifeforms.  These fiends cast no judgments on the intrinsic worth of any lifeform and hold a deadly parasite in just as much esteem as a humanoid whom they believe should provide a home for as many parasites as possible.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They spread diseases not out of malice but out of a desire to see life thrive, even if it is in the form of a plague.  Those who resist diseases, or worse, cure them, are seen as cruel destroyers of life by these fiends and their followers.  Death and decay are inevitable, and the best one can do is provide a loving home for as many other forms of life as possible while letting go of the need to hold onto what can't be maintained.

&emsp;**Beasts of Decay.**  These disgusting and ungainly fiends lurch across the ground with their slug-like bodies, bringing rot and death to everyone in their path.  The beast's legless lower body is topped with a vaguely humanoid upper body, and its head features a slobbering tongue and leech-like hair that constantly spews toxins.  Though their bodies appear bloated and awkward, beasts of decay have no trouble pulling themselves toward any creature that catches their attention, leaving a trail of acidic slime in their wake. 

Despite the beast of decay's horrid appearance and deadly nature, it is a jovial and affectionate fiend, virtually incapable of viewing any other creature as an enemy.  "Enemies" are simply potential playmates, and the beast is eager to earn their affection with big slobbering licks.  The fact that these licks rot, kill, and bring untold suffering to their "playmates" is beyond the beast's understanding.  A creature killed this way is transformed into another demon of decay, thus providing the beast with a more permanent playmate.

**Great Unclean One.**  These jolly greater demons are masters of rot and disease, which they happily spread to anyone they meet.  They have the appearance of massive, bloated corpses with entrails spilling forth from their open wounds and slimy horns topping their grinning, oversized heads.   This enormous body constantly oozes acidic slime and debilitating gasses, and its rotting girth makes it difficult to meaningfully damage.  Once it is in motion, the unclean one can easily crush other creatures under the momentum of its vile flesh, all while laughing merrily.

&emsp;Unclean ones wield rusted and decaying weapons, crusted with filth and disease, and their dreaded plague flails deliver an affliction that can transform victims into new demons of decay.  Enemies outside the reach of an unclean one's weapons are no safer, for these fiends can vomit streams of rotting bile over ridiculous distances.  These deadly combat abilities are supplemented by the unclean one's powerfully putrescent magic, which specializes in rotting and poisoning enemies as well as restoring vitality to its fellow demons.  

While an unclean one's presence inevitably brings death and decay, it behaves as though it is at a grand party.  There is a joyousness to its actions, and its diseases, spells, and attacks are simply how it spreads good cheer.  The unclean one has a parental fondness for its followers, and those who have given themselves over to the influence of these demons view their afflictions as loving presents.  Together they spread their pestilent gifts far and wide as they revel in the decay of all things.

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while it is infected, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.  This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.  The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0, at which point it is instantly transformed into a **plaguebearer**.

**Plaguebearer of Decay.**  These fiends are created from the souls of mortals who have succumbed to demonic diseases.  Their shambling humanoid bodies are bloated, rotten, and nearly zombie-like in appearance, though they can be distinguished from other undead by their cyclopean visage, which is topped with a single knarled horn.  Each of these fiends wields a rusted plaguesword, which carries the same disease that originally birthed it and is used to continue the proliferation of its kind. 

Plaguebearers feel the responsibility not just to spread disease but to count and catalog all diseases they encounter in hopes of establishing a complete record of every pathogen in existence.  Despite the impossible nature of this task, these neurotic fiends can often be heard counting illnesses they spot on the battlefield, groaning in frustration every time a distraction causes them to lose count.

## Demons of Decay in Your Adventures
The demons in this document are based on the daemons of Nurgle from the Warhammer franchise.  However, they can be adapted to fit any setting in which demons carry disease and seek to spread rot and entropy.  In more traditional Dungeons and Dragons settings, they could even serve other demon lords such as Orcus or Zuggtmoy, though they would likely be much less jovial in this case.  The following tables provide you with examples of ways to incorporate these demons into your adventures. 

##### Beast of Decay Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | Flamers of change keep appearing at seemingly random locations to wreak havoc before disappearing as quickly as they arrived, and no one knows the cause.  |

|  3  | In a desperate attempt to ward off an angry mob, a mad sorcerer has torn a hole in reality, unleashing a horde of flamers of change.   |
|  4  |  A demon lord has unleased flamers of change upon an unsuspecting settlement to study their effect on the Material Plane and its inhabitants.  |

|  6  |  An arcane staff offers  enhanced magical abilities at the risk of being transformed into a flamer of change.|
