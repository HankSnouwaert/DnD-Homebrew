# Demons of Decay
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness, but none are as revolting as the demons of decay.  These demons are born from the tendency of mortals to neglect themselves and the world they live in, thus allowing disease and entropy to run their course unopposed.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to spread plagues and decay.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of rot and disease.   

**Unnatural Vitality.** Demons of decay are easily recognized by their bloated, rotting, disease-ridden forms.  The decaying nature of their bodies does not mean these fiends are fragile or easy to slay.  Demons of decay can shrug off incredible amounts of punishment relative to their size while their would-be slayers slowly succumb to their diseases.  Many who worship these demons do so in hopes of gaining this unnatural vitality, even if it means subjecting themselves to horrific rot and disease. 

**Cheerful Nihilists.**  Demons of decay represent the inevitable deterioration of all things.  Those who have succumbed to nihilism and apathy are especially vulnerable to their influence.  Yet, these demons and their followers are almost always jolly and cheerful.  They revel in the pointlessness of life and celebrate the perpetual state of rot to which existence is subject.  Those who worship these fiends often seek a means of escaping despair and fear of death, and by accepting the gifts of rot and disease, these worshippers cheerfully shed all their worries and woes.

**Promoters of Life.**  The dark irony of these fiends is their genuine love of life.  They hold a motherly love for all living things, including diseases and parasites, which they fail to see as any less important than other lifeforms.  These fiends cast no judgments on the intrinsic worth of any lifeform and hold a deadly parasite in just as much esteem as a humanoid whom they believe should provide a home for as many parasites as possible.  They spread diseases not out of malice but out of a desire to see life thrive, even if it is in the form of a plague.

&emsp;**Fiends of Excess.** These obscene fiends combine lewd human features with a mutated bestial form.  Fiends of excess gallop at high speeds, their long tongues tasting the air as they search for prey.  Their unfortunate victims must not only contend with powerful claws but a nubile scorpion-like tail.  The poison from the tail's stinger numbs the senses to the point where many victims fall unconscious.  Fiends of excess use this opportunity to toy with their new playthings, ravaging their helpless prey with cruel wounds.  Those who awaken are racked with pain as sensation rushes back, their final moments filled with agony as the fiend gleefully tears apart and eats its victim alive.

Fiends of excess often serve as favored pets and war beasts for more powerful demon lords of excess.  When unleashed upon enemy forces, they sing disturbing melodies that disrupt the minds of any who hear them, impairing the ability to concentrate on spells.  Opponents who engage the fiends in melee combat fair no better, and they soon find themselves overwhelmed by a coying musk that leaves them sluggish and unresponsive.  These fiends relish the chaos and disruption they sow and gracefully dance through enemy ranks picking apart targets with surgical precision.

&emsp;**Lords of Change.** These greater demons are masters of deceit and reality-shattering sorcery.  Lords of change appear to be large, anthropomorphic birds with massive wings and long, vulturous necks.  They often sport various mutations, with some even having two heads.  

These fiendish masterminds spend every hour of their existence gathering information and orchestrating grand schemes.  By playing on the hopes and ambitions of mortals, lords of change manipulate these lowly creatures like chess pieces on the great board of reality.  

These supplicants believe they are being granted the knowledge to achieve their goals, but in truth, they are just puppets in a demon's intricate play.  The vast knowledge and innate magical nature of a lord of change make it one of the most powerful spell casters in the multiverse.  These fiends can perceive and manipulate the weave of magic as easily as a musician plays a favored instrument, and few mages can hope to compete with their mastery of spellcraft.

&emsp;**Daemonettes.** These hermaphroditic fiends feature a bizarre combination of alluring and grotesque features.  Their lithe, graceful bodies are humanoid in form but include demonic mutations such as horns, hooves, and crustation-like claws.  While these features should be repulsive, daemonettes possess a supernatural charm that causes onlookers to view them as paragons of beauty and desire.  Daemonettes can combine their charms to quickly undo the will of their foes.  The fiends will then ravage their helpless victims who remain enamored by their attackers even as they are torn apart.

## Demons of Change in Your Adventures
The demons in this document are based on the daemons of Tzeench from the Warhammer franchise.  However, they can be adapted to fit any setting in which demons seek to manipulate mortals and distort reality.  In more traditional Dungeons and Dragons settings, they could even serve other demon lords such as Fraz-Urb'luu or the Demogorgon.  The following tables provide you with examples of ways to incorporate these demons into your adventures.
