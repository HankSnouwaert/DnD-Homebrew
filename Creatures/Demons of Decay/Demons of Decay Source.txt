# Demons of Decay
Demons represent the dark, chaotic <br> impulses of humanity made manifest. <br> Different demons represent different <br> aspects of this darkness, but none are <br> as revolting as the demons of decay. <br>  These demons are born from the <br> tendency of mortals to neglect <br> themselves and the world they live in, thus allowing <br> disease and entropy to run their course unopposed. <br> In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to <br> spread plagues and decay.  On others, they act in service to <br> a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of rot and disease.   

***Unnatural Vitality.*** Demons of decay are easily recognized by their bloated, rotting, disease-ridden forms.  The decaying nature of their bodies does not mean these fiends are fragile or easy to slay.  Demons of decay can shrug off incredible amounts of punishment relative to their size while their would-be slayers slowly succumb to terrible afflictions.  Many who worship these demons do so in hopes of gaining this unnatural vitality, even if it means subjecting themselves to horrific rot and disease.

***Cheerful Nihilists.***  Demons of decay represent the inevitable deterioration of all things.  Those who have succumbed to nihilism and apathy are especially vulnerable to their influence.  Yet, these demons and their followers are almost always jolly and cheerful.  They revel in the pointlessness of life and celebrate the perpetual state of rot to which existence is subject.  Those who worship these fiends often seek a means of escaping despair and fear of death, and by accepting the gifts of rot and disease, these worshippers cheerfully shed all their worries and woes.

***Promoters of Life.***  The dark irony of these fiends is their genuine love of life.  They hold a motherly love for all living things, including diseases and parasites, which they fail to see as any less important than other lifeforms.  These fiends cast no judgments on the intrinsic worth of any lifeform and hold a deadly parasite in just as much esteem as a humanoid whom they believe should provide a home for as many parasites as possible.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They spread diseases not out of malice but out of a desire to see life thrive, even if it is in the form of a plague.  Those who resist diseases, or worse, cure them, are seen as cruel destroyers of life by these fiends and their followers.  Death and decay are inevitable, and the best one can do is provide a loving home for as many other forms of life as possible while letting go of the need to hold onto what can't be maintained.

&emsp;***Beasts of Decay.***  These disgusting and ungainly <br> fiends lurch across the ground with their slug-like <br> bodies, bringing rot and death to everyone in their <br> path.  The beast's legless lower body is topped with <br> a vaguely humanoid upper body, and its head features <br> a slobbering tongue and leech-like hair that constantly <br> spews toxins.  Though their bodies appear bloated and awkward, beasts of decay have no trouble pulling <br> themselves toward any creature that catches their <br> attention, leaving a trail of acidic slime in their wake. 

Despite the beast of decay's horrid appearance and <br> deadly nature, it is a jovial and affectionate fiend, <br> virtually incapable of viewing any other creature as <br> an enemy.  "Enemies" are simply potential  <br> playmates, and the beast is eager to earn their  <br> affection with big slobbering licks.  The fact that  <br> these licks rot, kill, and bring untold suffering to <br> their "playmates" is beyond the beast's understanding.  <br>  A creature killed this way is transformed into another  <br> demon of decay, thus providing the beast with a more permanent playmate.

***Great Unclean Ones.***  These jolly greater demons  <br> are masters of rot and disease, which they happily <br> spread to anyone they meet.  They have the appearance  <br> of massive, bloated corpses with entrails spilling forth  <br> from their open wounds and slimy horns topping their grinning, oversized heads.   This enormous body constantly oozes acidic slime and debilitating gasses, and its rotting girth makes it difficult to meaningfully damage.  Once it is in motion, the unclean one can easily crush other creatures under the momentum of its vile flesh, all while laughing merrily.

&emsp;Unclean ones wield rusted and decaying weapons, crusted with filth and disease, and their dreaded plague flails deliver an affliction that can transform victims into new demons of decay.  Enemies outside the reach of an unclean one's weapons are no safer, for these fiends can vomit streams of rotting bile over ridiculous distances.  These deadly combat abilities are supplemented by the unclean one's powerfully putrescent magic, which specializes in rotting and poisoning enemies as well as restoring vitality to its fellow demons.  

While an unclean one's presence inevitably brings death and decay, it behaves as though it is at a grand party.  There is a joyousness to its actions, and its diseases, spells, and attacks are simply how it spreads good cheer.  The unclean one has a parental fondness for its followers, and those who have given themselves over to the influence of these demons view their afflictions as loving presents.  Together they spread their pestilent gifts far and wide as they revel in the decay of all things.

***Plaguebearer of Decay.***  These fiends are created from the souls of mortals who have succumbed to demonic diseases.  Their shambling humanoid bodies are bloated, rotten, and nearly zombie-like in appearance, though they can be distinguished from other undead by their cyclopean visage, which is topped with a single knarled horn.  Each of these fiends wields a rusted plaguesword, which carries the same disease that originally birthed it and is used to continue the proliferation of its kind. 

Plaguebearers feel the responsibility not just to spread disease but to count and catalog all diseases they encounter in hopes of establishing a complete record of every pathogen in existence.  Despite the impossible nature of this task, these neurotic fiends can often be heard counting illnesses they spot on the battlefield, groaning in frustration every time a distraction causes them to lose count.

# Lore of Decay
Spellcasters wielding magic of decay favor <br> spells that inflict rot, disease, and entropy. <br> While many existing D&D spells can <br> represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this putrescent style of sorcery into your campaigns.

####  Inflict Rot
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Cleric, Warlock
___

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, it takes 3d10 necrotic damage and is afflicted with a disease that lasts until the spell ends.

A creature afflicted by this disease takes 3d10 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and must then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. 

If a diseased creature drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can end the disease on the creature and cause it to unleash a wave of rot. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. You may choose to have one of the creatures that failed the saving throw become infected with the same disease, which lasts for the remainder of the spell's duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, each time it would deal damage, it deals an additional 1d10 necrotic damage for each slot level above 4th.

#### Miasma of Pestilence
*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V S M (A bit of durian fruit)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A cloud of putrescent vapor appears in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a moderate wind (at least 5 miles per hour) disperses it after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Each creature completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Puddle of Ooze
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of slug slime)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid, Sorcerer 
___

You cover the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range with acidic ooze, causing it to become difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 1d4 acid damage for every 5 feet it travels.

When the ooze appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage.

#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the necrotic damage dealt to targeted creatures and creatures in the area of the cone of bile by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Demons of Decay in Your Adventures
The demons in this document can be adapted to fit any setting where fiends carry disease and seek to spread rot and entropy.  In more traditional Dungeons and Dragons settings, they could serve other demon lords such as Orcus or Zuggtmoy, though they would likely be less jovial in this case.  The following tables provide examples of ways to incorporate these demons into your adventures. 

##### Beast of Decay Adventures
