# Demons of Decay
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness, but none are so tempting as the demons of excess.  These demons are born from the mortal desire to overindulge in life's earthly pleasures.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to tempt and corrupt humanoids.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of excess and obsession.   

**Hedonistic Allure.** Unlike other demons, these fiends often present themselves as friendly to mortals, offering to aid them in achieving whatever gratification they desire.  Wherever they go, these fiends seek to drive mortals to self-destructive levels of debauchery.  If time and circumstance allow, this corruption can be done subtly as the demons work their influence across one or more individuals, slowly driving their victims to commit more and more depraved acts.  Over time, the victim's ability to delay any form of gratification wanes away, leaving behind a self-indulgent hedonist.

In combat, these demons can unleash their supernatural allure in a much less subtle way to temporarily impair and charm their enemies.  The fiends will use this tactic to reduce the number of combatants they face while swiftly dispatching any who resist their charms.  

**Ecstasy In Pain** While demons of excess prefer to undo their victims using their tempting charms, they are more than capable of dismembering their enemies.  When the situation calls, these fiends can move with incredible speed, closing the distance between themselves and a foe in the blink of an eye.  Their attacks are made with equal speed, and their agility makes them difficult to strike.  Regardless of how quickly they move, their motions are always made with sensual grace.

Even when excess demons resort to direct violence, their attacks are laced with perverse pleasure.  These demons blur pleasure and pain and their victims often moan with ecstatic agony even as they are ripped limb from limb.  Each of these demons' movements is made with erotic grace, and they relish every bit of pain they can inflict.  They even appear to take masochistic pleasure in their own pain, and will squeal in ecstasy as they are slain.

&emsp;**Daemonettes.** These hermaphroditic fiends feature a bizarre combination of alluring and grotesque features.  Their lithe, graceful bodies are humanoid in form but include demonic mutations such as horns, hooves, and crustation-like claws.  While these features should be repulsive, daemonettes possess a supernatural charm that causes onlookers to view them as paragons of beauty and desire.  Daemonettes can combine their charms to quickly undo the will of their foes.  The fiends will then ravage their helpless victims who remain enamored by their attackers even as they are torn apart.

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while it is infected, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.  This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.  The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0, at which point it is instantly transformed into a plaguebearer.  This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

&emsp;**Fiends of Excess.** These obscene fiends combine lewd human features with a mutated bestial form.  Fiends of excess gallop at high speeds, their long tongues tasting the air as they search for prey.  Their unfortunate victims must not only contend with powerful claws but a nubile scorpion-like tail.  The poison from the tail's stinger numbs the senses to the point where many victims fall unconscious.  Fiends of excess use this opportunity to toy with their new playthings, ravaging their helpless prey with cruel wounds.  Those who awaken are racked with pain as sensation rushes back, their final moments filled with agony as the fiend gleefully tears apart and eats its victim alive.

Fiends of excess often serve as favored pets and war beasts for more powerful demon lords of excess.  When unleashed upon enemy forces, they sing disturbing melodies that disrupt the minds of any who hear them, impairing the ability to concentrate on spells.  Opponents who engage the fiends in melee combat fair no better, and they soon find themselves overwhelmed by a coying musk that leaves them sluggish and unresponsive.  These fiends relish the chaos and disruption they sow and gracefully dance through enemy ranks picking apart targets with surgical precision.

&emsp;**Keeper of Secrets.** 
These greater demons are paragons of unfettered desire and destructive obsession.  The forms they assume are varied, but they are all huge fiends with vaguely humanoid forms that feature an amalgam of male, female, and bestial features.  These bodies sport four arms that end in diamond-sharp claws, and they move at such speed in combat they appear to be a blur of motion.
