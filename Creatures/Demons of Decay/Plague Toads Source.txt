## Plague <br> Toads
These wretched fiends appear as giant, mutant, disease-ridden toads with one or more boney horns protruding from their bulbous heads. Their rotting skin always seems to be sloughing off of them and spreads terrible diseases to those who come in contact with it.

Plague toads spawn in the vilest swamps of the demon realms. There, they lazily waddle and hop about, looking for the next easy meal while avoiding the attention of more powerful demons. The desire to avoid the wrath of other demons while finding easy prey leads plague toads to leap at any chance to cross into the mortal realm. Here they take up residence in foul sewers and fetid swamps, feeding on humanoids at every opportunity while spreading filth and disease in their wake.

Demonic cultists of decay will often summon plague toads to serve as guardians in their lairs, and when other demons of decay launch large-scale attacks, they will often herd knots of plague toads into battle alongside them. Some plague bearer demons even catch plague toads for themselves and put them to use as combat mounts. Though they aren't the fastest of steeds, plague toads can leap over obstacles and ram foes with their boney horns, knocking prey off their feet before quickly gobbling them up.

> ***Miasma of Rot.*** The toad emits a toxic cloud which extends 5 feet out from it. Any creature that starts its turn in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become infected with Wasting Sickness disease. While infected with the disease, a creature has disadvantage on Strength checks and saving throws. An infected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of a short or long rest, ending the disease on a success and becoming immune to the Wasting Sickness of all bog barons for the next 24 hours.

The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and at the start of each of the toad’s turns, its Strength score is reduced by 1d6 and is affected by the toad’s Miasma of Rot. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

***Bog Barons.*** Though all plague toads are bloated bags of disease, these toads have been blessed with a particularly potent disease that radiates from the toad's rotting skin in a vile miasma. This disease is commonly referred to as "wasting sickness" and withers away the muscle mass of its victims, eventually weakening them to the point where they can no longer breath or beat their heart.

Carrying this disease marks these plague toads with a higher status in their swamp homes, thus earning them the nickname of bog barons. Plague bearers see the bog barons as particularly valuable mounts, and those who have successfully captured them will form elite gangs of fetid shock cavalry.
