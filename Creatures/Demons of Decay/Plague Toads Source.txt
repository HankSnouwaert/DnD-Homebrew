## Plague Toads
These wretched fiends appear as giant, mutant, <br> disease-ridden toads with one or more boney <br> horns protruding from their bulbous heads. <br> Their  rotting skin always seems to be sloughing <br> off of them and spreads terrible diseases to those <br> who come in contact with it.

Plague toads spawn in the vilest swamps of the <br> demon realms. There, they lazily waddle and hop <br> about, looking for the next easy meal while avoiding <br> the attention of more powerful demons. The desire <br> to avoid the wrath of other demons while finding <br> easy prey leads plague toads to leap at any chance to <br> cross into the mortal realm. Here they take up <br> residence in foul sewers and fetid swamps, feeding <br> on humanoids at every opportunity while spreading <br> filth and disease in their wake.

Demonic cultists of decay will often summon plague <br> toads to serve as guardians in their lairs, and when <br> other demons of decay launch large-scale attacks, they <br> will often herd knots of plague toads into battle <br> alongside them.  Some plague bearer demons even catch plague toads for themselves and put them to use as combat <br> mounts. Though they aren't the fastest of steeds, plague toads can leap over obstacles and ram foes with their boney horns, knocking prey off their feet before quickly gobbling them up.

***Bog Barons.*** Though all plague toads are bloated bags of disease, these toads have been blessed with a particularly potent disease that radiates from the toad's rotting skin in a vile miasma. This disease is commonly referred to as "wasting sickness" and withers away the muscle mass of its victims, eventually weakening them to the point where they can no longer breath or beat their heart.

Carrying this disease marks these plague toads with a higher status in their swamp homes, thus earning them the nickname of bog barons. Plague bearers see the bog barons as particularly valuable mounts, and those who have successfully captured them will form elite gangs of fetid shock cavalry.

#### Plague Toads in Your Adventures

### Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. An hour after becoming infected, the victim begins displaying symptoms, and the Severity Level of the disease becomes 1. 

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while displaying symptoms, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

Every hour after the creature first displays symptoms, it repeats the saving throw against the disease, but with the save DC 1 higher than the last time the creature made the save. If the creature fails the saving throw, the Severity Level increases by 1, and it takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus the disease’s Severity Level.

If the disease reduces a creature’s hit point maximum to 0, it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer of decay**. This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

The healing touch ability of an angel or other celestial will instantly cure Abyssal Rot.

<br>

> ##### Secret Infection Rolls 
>When a player character must make a saving throw to determine if they are infected by a disease, it is usually better for the GM to make the roll in secret since the character won’t know they’re infected. <br> A Wisdom (Medicine) check can be made to determine if a creature has been infected before it starts displaying symptoms. For Abyssal Rot, a DC of 15 for this check is an appropriate baseline, though you may alter it for other diseases and circumstances.<br>
Subsequent rolls made to determine if the player character fights off the effects of the disease should usually be made by the player.

### Curing Diseases With Magical Abilities
Abilities like *lessor restoration* and Lay on Hands can instantly cure most diseases. If you wish to make diseases more difficult to remove, you can use or modify either of the following rules additions.

#### Ability Check to Cure
Whoever uses the ability to attempt to cure the disease must succeed on an ability check against the disease’s current save DC to eradicate it successfully. If the ability being used to cure the disease is a feature granted by a class with a spellcasting feature, the healer can add their Spell Attack Modifier for that class to the ability check. Otherwise, the healer can add their Wisdom modifier + their proficiency modifier to the ability check. 

If the check is being made to cure a creature that hasn’t started displaying symptoms yet, but the healer knows the creature is infected, the check is made with advantage.

#### Curing By Severity Level
When an ability that cures diseases is used on a diseased creature, it only reduces the severity level by 1.  
If you are using the Ability Check to Cure rule, you can allow the healer to reduce an additional severity level if the check’s result was 5 or more over the disease’s DC. You can extend this rule to allow a result of 10 over the DC to cure 2 additional severity levels, 15 over the DC to cure 3 additional severity levels, and so on.
