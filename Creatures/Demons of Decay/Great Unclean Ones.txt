### Daemoinc Gifts

The Great Unclean One and the Exalted Great Unclean One can choose any two the fallowing features. By default they have Noxious vapors and Slime Trail.

1  ***Slime Trail.*** Any land the unclean one or creature it is mounted occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain for one minute. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage for every 5 feet it travels. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 7 (3d4) acid damage. Demons of pestilence Ignore the effects of the slime.

2  ***Noxious Vapors.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the unclean one must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature's speed is halved and it is dazed. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Noxious vapors of all unclean ones for 1 hour.

3 **Infestation.*** At the start of the unclean one's turn, it heals a swarm or tide of paguelings within 10 feet of it for 34 hit points. This healing ignores the swarm rule regarding healing. If there are no swarms or tides of plaguelings within 10 feet of the unclean one below full health, it instead creates a plagueling swarm with 17 hit point inside it self as though the swarm used ***Noxious Cradle.*** on the unclean one. The new swarm has its own initiative and goes right after the  unclean one. The unclean one can have up to three swarms created by this ability at a time.

4 **Bloated Sours** The fist time each turn the demon is hit with a attack, Puss spews out in a 15-foot line that is 15 feet wide in the direction of the attacker, each creature in the area takes 9 (2d8) necrotic.
