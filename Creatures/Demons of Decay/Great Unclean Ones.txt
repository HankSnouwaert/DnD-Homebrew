## Great Unclean Ones

 These jolly greater demons are masters of rot and disease, which they happily spread to anyone they meet.  They have the appearance of massive, bloated corpses with entrails spilling forth from their open wounds and slimy horns topping their grinning, oversized heads. This enormous body constantly oozes acidic slime and debilitating gasses, and its rotting girth makes it difficult to meaningfully damage. Once it is in motion, the unclean one can easily crush other creatures under the momentum of its vile flesh, all while laughing merrily. 

Unclean ones wield rusted and decaying weapons, crusted with filth and disease, and their dreaded blades deliver an affliction that can transform victims into new demons of decay.  Enemies outside the reach of an unclean one's weapons are no safer, for these fiends can vomit streams of rotting bile over ridiculous distances.  These deadly combat abilities are supplemented by the unclean one's powerfully putrescent magic, which specializes in rotting and poisoning enemies as well as restoring vitality to its fellow demons.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

While an unclean one's presence inevitably brings death and decay, it behaves as though it is at a grand party.  There is a joyousness to its actions, and its diseases, spells, and attacks are simply how it spreads good cheer.  The unclean one has a parental fondness for its followers, and those who have given themselves over to the influence of these demons view their afflictions as loving presents.  Together they spread their pestilent gifts far and wide as they revel in the decay of all things.

The grandest and most accomplished of unclean ones are sometimes elevated to the status of exalted unclean ones. This is a rare occurrence for the unclean one must prove itself to be an unparalleled master of spreading pestilence and good cheer in equal measure before it has any chance of ascending to this level. Those who prove worthy become among the most powerful demons of decay in existence, leading legions of their foul brethren, spreading plagues beyond counting, and hosting pestilent festivals of legendary status.

### Daemonic Gifts

You can choose any two of the following features to add to the stat block of the great unclean one or exalted unclean one. The default stat blocks have Slime Trail and Noxious Vapors.

1. ***Slime Trail.*** Any land the unclean one, or a demon of decay it is mounted on, occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain for one minute. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage for every 5 feet it travels. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 7 (3d4) acid damage. Demons of decay ignore the effects of the slime.

2. ***Noxious Vapors.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the unclean one must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature's speed is halved and it is dazed. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Noxious Vapors of all demons of decay for 1 hour.

3. ***Infestation.*** At the start of each of the unclean one's turns, it heals a plagueling swarm or plagueling tide of its choice within 10 feet of it for 34 hit points. This healing ignores the swarm rule regarding healing. <br> If there are no such swarms within 10 feet of the unclean one below full health, it instead creates a plagueling swarm with 17 hit points inside itself as though the swarm used its ***Noxious Cradle*** ability to enter inside the unclean one. The new swarm has its own initiative and takes its turn right after the unclean one. The unclean one can have up to three swarms created by this ability at a time.

4. ***Bloated Pustules.*** The first time each turn that the unclean one is hit with an attack, puss spews out in a 15-foot cube originating from the unclean one in the direction of the attacker. Each creature in the area of the cube takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

### Uncle Cruncle
This demon is particularly unusual, even for an unclean one. Cruncle refers to himself as everyone’s uncle and is always in search of anyone to share his stories, knickknacks, and weird humor with. He would say he oozes charm, but it’s mostly noxious bodily fluids. Any time he finds a new audience, Uncle Cruncle rushes to greet them with awkward jokes and strange gifts no one in their right mind would want. These gifts are random curiosities he acquires during his journeys and stores in places better left unmentioned. Those who reject Cruncle’s gifts and attempts at entertainment tend to find themselves on the receiving end of his latest knickknack. 

Uncle Cruncle’s favorite gift is his own personal contagion he’s dubbed Uncle’s Bloat. It subjects its recipients to a painful form of gigantism, expanding their size and leaving them horribly gassy. This condition makes it much easier to subject his audience to the bodily fluids he leaves wherever he goes.

#### *Hey mortal, pull my finger!* <br> - Uncle Cruncle

<br>

Cruncle always finds new ways to subject others to his bodily functions, from his classic “sick shooter” to his latest trick, dubbed “The Chocolate Fountain.”  Never one to horde his abilities, Cruncle can spread the joy by inducing these same performances in others, thus covering huge areas in vile fluids. As these fluids rot away other creatures, they sustain and rejuvenate Cruncle, turning him into an unceasing mass of contagions, bodily functions, and insufferable jokes.

A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

### Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. An hour after becoming infected, the victim begins displaying symptoms, and the Severity Level of the disease becomes 1. 

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while displaying symptoms, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

Every hour after the creature first displays symptoms, it repeats the saving throw against the disease, but with the save DC 1 higher than the last time the creature made the save. If the creature fails the saving throw, the Severity Level increases by 1, and it takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus the disease’s Severity Level.

If the disease reduces a creature’s hit point maximum to 0, it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer of decay**. This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

The healing touch ability of an angel or other celestial will instantly cure Abyssal Rot.

> ##### Secret Infection Rolls 
>When a player character must make a saving throw to determine if they are infected by a disease, it is usually better for the GM to make the roll in secret since the character won’t know they’re infected. <br> A Wisdom (Medicine) check can be made to determine if a creature has been infected before it starts displaying symptoms. For Abyssal Rot, a DC of 15 for this check is an appropriate baseline, though you may alter it for other diseases and circumstances.<br>
Subsequent rolls made to determine if the player character fights off the effects of the disease should usually be made by the player.

### Curing Diseases With Magical Abilities
Abilities like *lessor restoration* and Lay on Hands can instantly cure most diseases. If you wish to make diseases more difficult to remove, you can use or modify either of the following rules additions.

#### Ability Check to Cure
Whoever uses the ability to attempt to cure the disease must succeed on an ability check against the disease’s current save DC to eradicate it successfully. If the ability being used to cure the disease is a feature granted by a class with a spellcasting feature, the healer can add their Spell Attack Modifier for that class to the ability check. Otherwise, the healer can add their Wisdom modifier + their proficiency modifier to the ability check. 

If the check is being made to cure a creature that hasn’t started displaying symptoms yet, but the healer knows the creature is infected, the check is made with advantage.

#### Curing By Severity Level
When an ability that cures diseases is used on a diseased creature, it only reduces the severity level by 1.  
If you are using the Ability Check to Cure rule, you can allow the healer to reduce an additional severity level if the check’s result was 5 or more over the disease’s DC. You can extend this rule to allow a result of 10 over the DC to cure 2 additional severity levels, 15 over the DC to cure 3 additional severity levels, and so on.
