## Plaguelings

These tiny disease-ridden fiends look like malevolent  children twisted into rotting monsters. Their gaping mouths drool greenish slime as they cackle like wicked infants, dancing about and looking for new playthings. Plagulings spawn from within greater demons of decay, growing within the putrid flesh of their parent demon, drawing sustenance from the bile and disease their host offers. Once the plagueling has grown to the size of a bloated infant, it erupts into the world, looking for more sustenance. Many plaguelings remain with their demon hosts, acting like coddled children, always looking for food and attention from their demonic caretaker.

***Burrowing Parasites.*** Plaguelings retain the ability to burrow within other willing creatures. This is done through supernatural means that don’t harm the host, though most mortals would find the process horribly disturbing. Demons of decay are often hosts to entire swarms of plaguelings that can burst forth at a moment’s notice.

***Pestilent Mischief Makers.*** Plaguelings prefer to stay near the protection of other demons of decay, but should one find itself on its own, it will seek out the nearest humanoid settlement to make mischief. Though a lone plagueling is little threat in combat, it can sneak through a town and threaten its inhabitants’ health by spoiling food, poisoning water, and spreading sickness to children and animals.

***Overwhelming Numbers.*** Plaguelings are social creatures and prefer to congregate into swarms. When they reach these numbers, they go from hazardous nuisances to deadly threats. Plaguelings in a swarm can work together to move at much higher speeds than any one plagueling could individually as they glom onto each other and roll together in a tide of flesh and filth. When they reach their targets, the plaguelings latch onto their new playmates like children climbing on their parents, dragging them down and subjecting them to all manner of grizzly diseases. 

***Swarming Steeds.*** Bizarrely enough, demons of decay often use swarms of plaguelings as perverse steeds, allowing the writhing mass to carry them into battle. These swarms often hide inside the demon until it has need for them. A demon of decay that sees foes at a distance may suddenly vomit forth a swarm of plaguelings that quickly pick it up and carry it to its victims at rapid speed. Other demons may allow foes to close in on them and allow themselves to appear outnumbered. Only when the fiends start regurgitating swarms of revolting plaguelings, do their attackers release the grave miscalculation they’ve made.

### Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. An hour after becoming infected, the victim begins displaying symptoms, and the Severity Level of the disease becomes 1. 

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while displaying symptoms, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

Every hour after the creature first displays symptoms, it repeats the saving throw against the disease, but with the save DC 1 higher than the last time the creature made the save. If the creature fails the saving throw, the Severity Level increases by 1, and it takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus the disease’s Severity Level.

If the disease reduces a creature’s hit point maximum to 0, it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer of decay**. This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

The healing touch ability of an angel or other celestial will instantly cure Abyssal Rot.

<br>

> ##### Secret Infection Rolls 
>When a player character must make a saving throw to determine if they are infected by a disease, it is usually better for the GM to make the roll in secret since the character won’t know they’re infected. <br> A Wisdom (Medicine) check can be made to determine if a creature has been infected before it starts displaying symptoms. For Abyssal Rot, a DC of 15 for this check is an appropriate baseline, though you may alter it for other diseases and circumstances.<br>
Subsequent rolls made to determine if the player character fights off the effects of the disease should usually be made by the player.

### Curing Diseases With Magical Abilities
Abilities like *lessor restoration* and Lay on Hands can instantly cure most diseases. If you wish to make diseases more difficult to remove, you can use or modify either of the following rules additions.

#### Ability Check to Cure
Whoever uses the ability to attempt to cure the disease must succeed on an ability check against the disease’s current save DC to eradicate it successfully. If the ability being used to cure the disease is a feature granted by a class with a spellcasting feature, the healer can add their Spell Attack Modifier for that class to the ability check. Otherwise, the healer can add their Wisdom modifier + their proficiency modifier to the ability check. 

If the check is being made to cure a creature that hasn’t started displaying symptoms yet, but the healer knows the creature is infected, the check is made with advantage.

#### Curing By Severity Level
When an ability that cures diseases is used on a diseased creature, it only reduces the severity level by 1.  
If you are using the Ability Check to Cure rule, you can allow the healer to reduce an additional severity level if the check’s result was 5 or more over the disease’s DC. You can extend this rule to allow a result of 10 over the DC to cure 2 additional severity levels, 15 over the DC to cure 3 additional severity levels, and so on.
