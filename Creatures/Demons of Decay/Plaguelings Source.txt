These fiends are created from the souls of mortals who have succumbed to demonic diseases. Their shambling humanoid bodies are bloated, rotten, and nearly zombie-like in appearance. Each of these fiends wields a rusted plaguesword, which carries the same disease that originally birthed it and is used to continue the proliferation of its kind. Those wounded by the sword risk contracting Abyssal Rot, a fiendish disease that transforms those who succumb to it into other plague bearers.
