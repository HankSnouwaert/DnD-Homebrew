> ***Leap Attack.*** If the toad jumps at least 20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a gore attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the toad can make a bite attack against it as a bonus action.
>
> ***Living Plague.*** The toad is immune to diseases, and if it is targeted by a spell or effect that cures disease, such as Lay on Hands or *lesser restoration*, it takes 20 radiant damage. 
>
> ***Plague Secretion.*** A creature that touches the toad must make DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of the turn or become infected by Abyssal Rot.
>
> ***Standing Leap.*** The toad's long jump is up to 40 ft. and its high jump is up to 20 ft., with or without a running start.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (2d10 + 4) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the toad can't use its bite attack or tongue attack on another target.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage.
>
> ***Swallow.*** The toad makes a bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and it takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage at the start of each of the toad's turns and is affected by its Plague Secretion. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ***Tongue.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and the target must make a DC 14 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the target is pulled to a space within 5 feet of the toad, which can immediately use its bonus action to make a bite attack against the target.
