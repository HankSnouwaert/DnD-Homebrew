#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the plaguefather can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

* The plaguefather chooses two creatures infected with his experimental diseases that he is aware of in his layer. He chooses one that must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it gains all the symptoms of the other creature.

* The plaguefather chooses a creature within his layer that he is aware of in his layer and forces it to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is infected with an experimental disease with a random symptom determined by the Experimental Disease Table on the page after the next. A creature already infected with an experimental disease has this disease's symptom added to its current infection.

* The plaguefather chooses one plagueling swarm he is aware of in his layer and causes them to begin bloating and expanding. At the end of the plagueling swarm’s next turn, it explodes and dies. Each creature within 15 feet of the plagueling swarm must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking acid damage equal to the hit points the swarm had when it died on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

> ___
>
>  ***Living Plague.*** The plaguefather is immune to diseases, and if he is targeted by a spell or effect that cures disease, such as Lay on Hands or *lesser restoration*, he takes 20 radiant damage.
>
> ***Corpulent Mass.*** The plaguefather regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes 20 or more fire or radiant damage in a single turn, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. The plaguefather dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
>
> ***Infestation.*** At the start of each of the plaguefather's turns, he heals a plagueling swarm or plagueling tide of his choice within 10 feet of him for 64 hit points. This healing ignores the swarm rule regarding healing. <br> If there are no such swarms within 10 feet of the plaguefather below full health, he instead creates a plagueling swarm with 34 hit points inside himself as though the swarm used its ***Noxious Cradle*** ability to enter inside the plaguefather. The new swarm has its own initiative and takes its turn right after the plaguefather. The plaguefather can have up to three swarms created by this ability at a time.
>
> ***Slime Trail.*** Any land the plaguefather, or a demon of decay he is mounted on, occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain for one minute. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage for every 5 feet it travels. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 7 (3d4) acid damage. Demons of decay ignore the effects of the slime.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The plaguefather makes two attacks. He can use a Necrotic Missile in place of one of his attacks.
>
> ***Slam*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (5d10 + 6)  bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Necrotic Missile.*** If the plaguefather is not restrained or grappled, he hurls an explosive plagueling at a point he can see within 300 feet that is not behind total cover. <br>
The plagueling detonates at this point, and each creature within 15 feet of it that's not behind total cover must make a DC 22 Constituion saving throw. <Br> On failed save, a creature takes 36 (8d8) necrotic damage and becomes infected with an experimental disease with a symptom determined using the Experimental Disease Table on the next page. All creatures that fail the save are infected with the same disease. A creature already infected with an experimental disease has this disease's symptom added to its current infection. <br>
On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't infected. <br>
All diseases inflicted this way end when the plaguefather dies, and creatures normally immune to diseases can still be infected with these diseases.<br>
When the plaguefather uses this action, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against him as though he moved out of their reach. If a creature hits him this way, he drops the plagueling, and it detonates centered on his location.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Blubber and Bile*** When the plaguefather takes damage, he halves the damage and then reduces it by 1d12.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The plaguefather can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The plaguefather regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.
> 
> **Check.** The plaguefather makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
> 
> **Swarm Surge.** A plagueling tide or swarm within 120 feet of the plaguefather moves up to its movement.
>
> **Plagueling Infestation.** The plaguefather targets a non-swarm creature within 300 feet that just ended its turn, causing a plagueling swarm with 34 hit points to appear centered on its location. If there is already a plagueling swarm or tide in that creature’s space, that swarm gains 34 hit points instead, and the creature that just ended its turn must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or be automatically hit by a bite attack from the swarm (no action required.) 
>
> **Conglomerate.** Two plagueling swarms the plaguefather is aware of that have all their hit points and are within 5 feet of each other merge and become a plagueling tide. The plagueling tide has its own initiative and goes right after the plaguefather. If either of the plagueling swarms were attached to any creatures, those creatures are now grappled by the plagueling tide as though they’ve been hit by its bite attack. The plaguefather can only have one plagueling tide created this way at a time.
> 
> **Tenacious Will.** If the plaguefather is suffering from an effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of his next turn, he may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. He can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
