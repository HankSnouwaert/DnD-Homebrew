## Beasts of Decay

These disgusting and ungainly fiends <br> lurch across the ground with their slug-like <br> bodies, bringing rot and death to everyone <br> in their path.  The beast's legless lower body <br> is topped with a vaguely humanoid upper <br> body, and its head features a slobbering <br> tongue and leech-like hair that constantly <br> spews toxins.  Though their bodies appear <br> bloated and awkward, beasts of decay have <br> no trouble pulling  themselves toward any <br> creature that catches their attention, <br> leaving  a trail of acidic slime in their wake. 

Despite the beast of decay's horrid <br> appearance and deadly nature, it is a jovial <br> and affectionate fiend, virtually incapable of <br> viewing any other creature as an enemy. <br> "Enemies" are simply potential playmates, <br> and the beast is eager to earn their affection <br> with big slobbering licks.  The fact that these <br> licks rot, kill, and bring untold suffering to <br> their "playmates" is beyond the beast's <br> understanding. A creature killed this way is <br> transformed into another demon of decay, <br> thus providing the beast with a more <br> permanent playmate.

  #### Beasts of Decay in Your Adventures
The following table provides some adventure hooks for incorporating beasts of decay into your adventures.  


##### Beast of Decay Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | A mad cultist takes her pet beast of decay out on walks in the dead of night.  Anyone who crosses their path is subject to its deadly affection.  |
|  2  |A beast of decay has taken residence near a local pond, playing in the now polluted water and killing all nearby wildlife in the process.  |
|  3  | A pack of beasts of decay has begun roaming the sewers of a major city, surfacing in the night to find new playmates.   |
|  4  |  A beast of decay has taken a liking to a party member, who it now follows and regards as its best friend.  |
|  5  | An old lady asks the party to find her lost puppy in the woods.  If they find the "puppy," they discover that it's a beast of decay.|
|  6  |  A greater demon has unleashed a pack of beasts of decay to play in a now panic-stricken town as it prepares for a larger invasion.|

### Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. An hour after becoming infected, the victim begins displaying symptoms, and the Severity Level of the disease becomes 1. 

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while displaying symptoms, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

Every hour after the creature first displays symptoms, it repeats the saving throw against the disease, but with the save DC 1 higher than the last time the creature made the save. If the creature fails the saving throw, the Severity Level increases by 1, and it takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus the disease’s Severity Level.

If the disease reduces a creature’s hit point maximum to 0, it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer of decay**. This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

The healing touch ability of an angel or other celestial will instantly cure Abyssal Rot.

### Curing Diseases With Magical Abilities
Abilities like *lessor restoration* and Lay on Hands can instantly cure most diseases. If you wish to make diseases more difficult to remove, you can use or modify either of the following rules additions.

> ##### Secret Infection Rolls 
>When a player character must make a saving throw to determine if they are infected by a disease, it is usually better for the GM to make the roll in secret since the character won’t know they’re infected. <br> A Wisdom (Medicine) check can be made to determine if a creature has been infected before it starts displaying symptoms. For Abyssal Rot, a DC of 15 for this check is an appropriate baseline, though you may alter it for other diseases and circumstances.<br>
Subsequent rolls made to determine if the player character fights off the effects of the disease should usually be made by the player.

<br>

#### Ability Check to Cure
Whoever uses the ability to attempt to cure the disease must succeed on an ability check against the disease’s current save DC to eradicate it successfully.

If the ability being used to cure the disease is a feature granted by a class with a spellcasting feature, the healer can add their Spell Attack Modifier for that class to the ability check. Otherwise, the healer can add their Wisdom modifier + their proficiency modifier to the ability check. 

If the check is being made to cure a creature that hasn’t started displaying symptoms yet, but the healer knows the creature is infected, the check is made with advantage.

#### Curing By Severity Level
When an ability that cures diseases is used on a diseased creature, it only reduces the severity level by 1.  
If you are using the Ability Check to Cure rule, you can allow the healer to reduce an additional severity level if the check’s result was 5 or more over the disease’s DC. You can extend this rule to allow a result of 10 over the DC to cure 2 additional severity levels, 15 over the DC to cure 3 additional severity levels, and so on.
