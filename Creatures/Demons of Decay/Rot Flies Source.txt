## Rot Flies

These malevolent fiends possess <br> a cruelty counter to the usual jovial <br> nature of most demons of decay. <br> These demons resemble giant flies <br> the size of horses and possess bladed <br> arms and massive stingers capable of <br> delivering enormous dosages of venom. <br> But the most disturbing of all the rot fly's <br> weapons is its deadly proboscis, capable <br> of dissolving flesh and devouring its victim's <br> head. The heads devoured this way are digested <br> down to their skulls, which are transformed into <br> fiendish grenade-like weapons known as death's <br> heads. The rot flies expel these death's heads which <br> are used by other demons of decay to slay masses of foes.

> ***Living Plague.*** The rot fly is immune to diseases, and if it is targeted by a spell or effect that cures disease, such as Lay on Hands or *lesser restoration*, it takes 20 radiant damage. 
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The rot fly makes two attacks with its blade legs.
>
> ***Blade Legs.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d10 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Proboscis.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) acid damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature and the attack was made with advantage, the rot fly attaches to the target's head (assuming it has one). While the rot fly is attached, the creature is restrained, blinded, unable to breathe or speak, and can't cast spells with verbal components. <br>At the start of each of the rot fly's turns, any creature it is attached to takes 21 (6d6) acid damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected by Abyssal Rot (description at end of document). <br>The rot fly can't use its proboscis on another creature while attached. The rot fly can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement. A creature, including the target, can use its action to detach the rot fly by succeeding on a DC 15 Strength check. Only one rot fly can be attached to a creature at a time (unless it has multiple heads).
>
> ***Stinger.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d10 + 4) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) poison damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If it fails the repeated saving throw by 5 or more (DC 10), it is paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

It is said that rot flies were once beasts of decay that were repeatedly slain in the mortal realm by those they tried to share their deadly affection with. The beasts of decay sought out new mortal friends but were cut down by these would-be companions. Bitterness grew in the hearts of the beasts, and when they reformed on their demonic home plain, that bitterness warped them into rot flies. Rot flies that make their way into the Material Plane are said to seek the mortals who previously slew them and prioritize exacting vengeance at all costs unless they are being controlled by a powerfully strong-willed master. 

Plague bearers who have such a will may use rot flies as mounts. These plague bearers are known as plague drones and are notorious for raining down death's head bombs on their foes before swooping in with their deadly rot flies to pick off stragglers.

### Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. An hour after becoming infected, the victim begins displaying symptoms, and the Severity Level of the disease becomes 1. 

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while displaying symptoms, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

Every hour after the creature first displays symptoms, it repeats the saving throw against the disease, but with the save DC 1 higher than the last time the creature made the save. If the creature fails the saving throw, the Severity Level increases by 1, and it takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus the disease’s Severity Level.

If the disease reduces a creature’s hit point maximum to 0, it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer of decay**. This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

The healing touch ability of an angel or other celestial will instantly cure Abyssal Rot.

<br>

> ##### Secret Infection Rolls 
>When a player character must make a saving throw to determine if they are infected by a disease, it is usually better for the GM to make the roll in secret since the character won’t know they’re infected. <br> A Wisdom (Medicine) check can be made to determine if a creature has been infected before it starts displaying symptoms. For Abyssal Rot, a DC of 15 for this check is an appropriate baseline, though you may alter it for other diseases and circumstances.<br>
Subsequent rolls made to determine if the player character fights off the effects of the disease should usually be made by the player.

### Curing Diseases With Magical Abilities
Abilities like *lessor restoration* and Lay on Hands can instantly cure most diseases. If you wish to make diseases more difficult to remove, you can use or modify either of the following rules additions.

#### Ability Check to Cure
Whoever uses the ability to attempt to cure the disease must succeed on an ability check against the disease’s current save DC to eradicate it successfully. If the ability being used to cure the disease is a feature granted by a class with a spellcasting feature, the healer can add their Spell Attack Modifier for that class to the ability check. Otherwise, the healer can add their Wisdom modifier + their proficiency modifier to the ability check. 

If the check is being made to cure a creature that hasn’t started displaying symptoms yet, but the healer knows the creature is infected, the check is made with advantage.

#### Curing By Severity Level
When an ability that cures diseases is used on a diseased creature, it only reduces the severity level by 1.  
If you are using the Ability Check to Cure rule, you can allow the healer to reduce an additional severity level if the check’s result was 5 or more over the disease’s DC. You can extend this rule to allow a result of 10 over the DC to cure 2 additional severity levels, 15 over the DC to cure 3 additional severity levels, and so on.
