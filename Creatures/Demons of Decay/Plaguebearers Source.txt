## Plague Bearers of Decay


These fiends are created from the souls of mortals who have succumbed to demonic diseases. Their shambling humanoid bodies are bloated, rotten, and nearly zombie-like in appearance. Each of these fiends wields a rusted plaguesword, which carries the same disease that originally birthed it and is used to continue the proliferation of its kind. Those wounded by the sword risk contracting Abyssal Rot, a fiendish disease that transforms those who succumb to it into other plague bearers.

Plague bearers feel the responsibility not just to spread disease but to count and catalog all diseases they encounter in hopes of establishing a complete record of every pathogen in existence.  Despite the impossible nature of this task, these neurotic fiends can often be heard counting illnesses they spot on the battlefield, groaning in frustration every time a distraction causes them to lose count.

> ##### The Dazed Condition
> Several of the abilities of these demons inflict the “Dazed” condition. At the time of this writing, this is a condition defined in the playtest material for D&D One. You can use the effects of that condition, or the following effect: <br> **A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.**

<br>

***Exalted Plague Bearers.*** Some plague bearers are significantly more powerful than their kin. These demons may have been particularly hardy mortals who fought off their fiendish infection for longer before finally succumbing, or they may be plague bearers who’ve survived long enough to earn the favor of their demon god. These “exalted” plague bearers are harder to kill, carry more virulent diseases, and possess greater levels of martial skill.

***Festering Stooges.*** These plague bearers have been “blessed” with clouds of hungry flies that follow them wherever they go. The flies constantly distract the stooge from any tasks it tries to concentrate on, and it often makes fruitless attempts at shooing them away or attempting to count and name them all. These constant distractions result in festering stooges always appearing clumsy and scatterbrained. 

Through some combination of bad luck and poor judgment, they often stumble into precarious situations that would spell the doom of most creatures. Luckily, their flies offer protection and regenerative abilities, ensuring that these stooges usually survive as they meander their way from one bubbling situation to the next.

***Plague Bearer Commanders.*** The most powerful plague bearers become leaders of entire hordes of entire rotting demons. They possess an ease and joviality at odds with their more serious kin and happily guide what they see as their fiendish family from one “party” to the next, spreading plagues and good cheer. The plague-ridden are lesser commanders who lead small parties of rotting demons, while heralds of decay are mighty lords who can shepherd teeming hordes of festering fiends.

These commanders draw power from the infections their kin spreads and happily share this power back with their fellow demons, continuing the cycle of life and death as they spread disease, draw power from the disease, and use that power to spread more disease. These mighty fiends are so infused with the powers of decay that they possess limited, but powerful, magical abilities that they can use to rapidly poison and rot away even the hardiest of adventurers.

> ##### Plague Riders
> If you wish to have any type of plague bearer you're using ride a controlled mount, you can give it the following trait:<br> ***Plague Rider.*** If the plague bearer has a controlled mount that is also a demon of decay, it can have the mount take the Attack action once on each of the plague bearer’s turns.

#### Locus of Rot Abilities
The plague bearers who serve as commanders draw power from the infections of those around them and pass that power onto the demons they lead. Every plague-ridden and herald of decay has one of the following abilities.

***Locus of Fecundity.*** The plague bearer and each demon of decay within 30 feet of it regains 5 hit points at the start of the plague bearer’s turn per each non-demon of pestilence creature infected with Abyssal Rot within 30 feet of the plague bearer, up to a maximum of 20 hit points.
 
 ***Locus of Virulence*** The plague bearer and each demon of decay within 30 feet of it have advantage on attack rolls against creatures infected with Abyssal Rot.

***Locus of Contagion*** When a creature fails a saving throw against the Fetid Stench or Gloom of Flies abilities of a demon of decay while within 30 feet of the plague bearer, it is infected with Abyssal Rot.

\columnbreak

### Death's Heads

These vile weapons a created from the skulls of those who have succumbed to demons of decay. They are thrown like grenades that explode into clouds of rot and disease. You may equip a plague bearer exalted plague bearer, or a festering stooge with 3 death heads. If you do, increase its CR by 1. The equipt creature can throw a death’s head as an Attack action or in place of an attack that’s part of its multiattack action.

#### New Magic Item: Death's Head
*Wondrous item, uncommon*<br>
As an action, if you are not restrained or grappled, you can hurl this item at a point you can see within 30 feet that is not behind total cover. The death’s head detonates at this point, and each creature within 10 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a DC 15 Constituion saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13 (3d8) necrotic damage and becomes infected by Abyssal Rot (description at the end of document). On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t infected.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the death’s head, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the death’s head, and it detonates at your location.

### Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. An hour after becoming infected, the victim begins displaying symptoms, and the Severity Level of the disease becomes 1. 

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while displaying symptoms, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

Every hour after the creature first displays symptoms, it repeats the saving throw against the disease, but with the save DC 1 higher than the last time the creature made the save. If the creature fails the saving throw, the Severity Level increases by 1, and it takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus the disease’s Severity Level.

If the disease reduces a creature’s hit point maximum to 0, it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer of decay**. This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

The healing touch ability of an angel or other celestial will instantly cure Abyssal Rot.

<br>

> ##### Secret Infection Rolls 
>When a player character must make a saving throw to determine if they are infected by a disease, it is usually better for the GM to make the roll in secret since the character won’t know they’re infected. <br> A Wisdom (Medicine) check can be made to determine if a creature has been infected before it starts displaying symptoms. For Abyssal Rot, a DC of 15 for this check is an appropriate baseline, though you may alter it for other diseases and circumstances.<br>
Subsequent rolls made to determine if the player character fights off the effects of the disease should usually be made by the player.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### Curing Diseases With Magical Abilities
Abilities like *lessor restoration* and Lay on Hands can instantly cure most diseases. If you wish to make diseases more difficult to remove, you can use or modify either of the following rules additions.

#### Ability Check to Cure
Whoever uses the ability to attempt to cure the disease must succeed on an ability check against the disease’s current save DC to eradicate it successfully. If the ability being used to cure the disease is a feature granted by a class with a spellcasting feature, the healer can add their Spell Attack Modifier for that class to the ability check. Otherwise, the healer can add their Wisdom modifier + their proficiency modifier to the ability check. 

If the check is being made to cure a creature that hasn’t started displaying symptoms yet, but the healer knows the creature is infected, the check is made with advantage.

#### Curing By Severity Level
When an ability that cures diseases is used on a diseased creature, it only reduces the severity level by 1.  
If you are using the Ability Check to Cure rule, you can allow the healer to reduce an additional severity level if the check’s result was 5 or more over the disease’s DC. You can extend this rule to allow a result of 10 over the DC to cure 2 additional severity levels, 15 over the DC to cure 3 additional severity levels, and so on.
