# Isonades
This monstrous shark stalks fishing routes, preferring stormy or murky waters that reduce visibility and help it to sneak up on its prey. The isonade's preferred prey is not the fish along these routes, but the fishermen and its victims are often snatched right off their ship without a trace of their passing.

***Fisher of Fishermen.*** The isonade possesses a long, dexterous hooked tail it uses to snatch up its prey. Sailors near the edge of their boat may suddenly be pulled overboard before they can even shout, and the isonade has the uncanny ability to sneak up and perform such attacks while no one else is looking. One by one, the boat's crew may disappear, with the terrified sailors unaware of the shark's presence. 

Even on larger ships, where the deck is far above the water's surface, travelers near the railing are not safe. When the isonade spots an isolated target on such a ship, it can leap 40 feet out of the water to reach its victim, yanking them overboard to their watery death.

***Barbed Armor.*** Even those able to put up a fight against the isonade find themselves pitted against an unnaturally fearsome foe. Not only does the isonade combine the natural ferocity of a shark with an unnatural hook tail, but it is also clad in armor-plating covered in wicked barbed spines. Those who tangle with the isonade in melee, or are snatched by its tail, risk being hooked to the monster, unable to flee as it drags them into the depths.

***Anti-Naval War Beast.*** Isonades are feared and revered by sahuagin, for they are potent allies but dangerously difficult to control, with only especially powerful sahuagin able to do so. Isonades working alongside sahuagin are used to counter enemy ships by preying on their crew. The isonade pulls sailors overboard, where the sahuagin can easily dispatch them. Sometimes the isonade rapidly pulls as many enemies overboard as possible, and other times it waits until a key target is vulnerable before striking. Eventually, the ship is deprived of critical combatants, with the survivors staying away from the deck's edge. This paves the way for the sahuagin's attack as they climb aboard the ship and slaughter the remaining crew.

>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 18 (3d8 + 5) piercing damage.
>
> ***Hooked Tail.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 15 (3d6 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pulled within 5 feet of the isonade.  If the target is a medium creature or smaller, it is then subjected to the isonade's Hooked Hide trait.

### Isonade Adventures
The following table provides some ways to introduce isonades into your games:


##### Isonade Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The players are journeying on a crowded ship to their next destination when they begin to notice that people are disappearing each night. |
|  2  |The players find a small fishing boat, apparently abandoned in stormy waters.  |
|  3  | An isonade uses a fisherman's floating body as bait to lure sailors within range of its hook.   |
|  4  |  A school of isonades has become adept at rapidly dismantling small boats, turning the crews into helpless meals. |
|  5  | Sailors and fishermen must pay tribute to a local sahuagin baron or become the target of his isonade.|
|  6  | A storm wash tides of sea water containing isonades into a port city's sewers. Now the isonades stalk under the city's streets, snatching lone pedestrians down sewer drains. |
