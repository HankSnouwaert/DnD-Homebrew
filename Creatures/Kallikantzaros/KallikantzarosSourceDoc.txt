"Kallikantzaros" are small creatures that hibrate all years longs, on the winter solstice the creatures cross over into the matral plane to spread havic. They apear as small golbions with black fur and tusks and red buring eyes weadling wood chopping axes

"Lost golbion kin" Some say Kallikantzaros are were once golbions that attpeted to esacpe the warth of the goblion gods by hinding underground deep with the feywild, feeding on the roots powerful druidic trees under the earth. 

What ever the case the Kallikantzaros spend all most all of the year undergound choping at the roots power magic trees feeding on the spa to sustane them selfs all year. They have a nack for avoiding druids and other fay that wish to remove form these groves.

"Winter revelry" The on the days of the winters soltice the Kallikantzaros will spring from the ground and cross though to the mortal rleam and go on rampages, They have a tast for sweets will deveor themm chopping apart anything else in the way to this goal, sweet meats bing some of their feverts. They aslo have impluse to chop down trees they find along the way sreach for sap, Evergreens being irresistible hacking them to bits if on stop. for these resone witner festival will ddraw in Kallikantzaros down all sweets hack apart any holiday trees they find, they sever sated and can not be barged, they want every sweet eaten tree shreeed and will go until the witer slostle end and they called back to the feywild to rest for another year

"Drop" The Kallikantzaros have love for droping on out trees on to thier eneimes, many have fallen vicume to attemping stop them form climing and hacking breach of fevetivle trees, only to have the Kallikantzaros drop from above and latch onto and lash with it's axe. Kallikantzaros  will aslo sneek up on creature cooking sweet hams or others goods droping from above leaving the target with lash. Kallikantzaros will leave cut wound creatures, if qwery feels they will on chase as long they have got what them have come for, Kallikantzaros do enjoy killing anything not made out wood, or eating anything that is not sweet.
