## Beaver
These small, semi-aquatic mammals appear cute and unassuming, but no other animal is capable of producing such dramatic changes in its river environment.  Though they only reach 2 feet in height, these plump creatures weigh up to 66 pounds, allowing them to out girth most halflings.  Their heavy build and webbed limbs make beavers comically awkward on land, but they are well adapted to spending most of their time in freshwater, even through cold winters.

***Industrious Masons.*** Among the most iconic characteristics of the beaver is its massive set of teeth, which it uses for its most iconic activity: gnawing down trees to build its river dam home.  A beaver can fell a tree half a foot wide within an hour and bring down even larger trees if given enough time.  The beaver’s stalky and muscular frame allows it to lift and drag heavier loads than its size would indicate, and the industrious creature can quickly amass large quantities of lumber at the site of its new home.

Using a combination of gnawed wood, stones, and hard mud, beavers create dams capable of housing large families.  These dams can be modest 10 foot long structures or massive feats of engineering reaching over 300 feet long.  The dams are quite resilient and can only be entered via underwater tunnels.  Beavers are also diligent about repairing and maintaining their homes, using their keen hearing to detect leaks in need of patching.

> ##### Beavers as Familiars
> **Beavers** may be used as a familiar option when casting the *find familiar* spell.  If a **beaver** is summoned this way, it may still use its bite attack against objects.

&nbsp; &nbsp; ***Ecosystem Engineers.*** Besides humanoids, no creature does more to shape its environment than the beaver.  The dams beavers create can alter the paths of rivers, reshape lakes, and create new ponds.  These effects are often a boon for their home ecosystems, but beavers can also be a bane upon environments that aren’t suited to their deforesting and river-altering tendencies.  Beaver dams can also result in the sudden flooding of humanoid settlements.

***Giant Beavers.*** These enormous creatures can reach lengths of over 7 feet and weigh in at anywhere between 200 and 300 pounds.  Though giant beavers are the primeval cousins of the modern beaver, they are not known to bring down trees or build dams and instead feed on freshwater plants.  As such, they lack the intelligence needed for complex engineering and the flat tail useful for padding down the dam materials during construction, instead sporting a longer rat-like tail.  However, they still possess impressive aquatic abilities, and their increased bulk and massive teeth make them a much more formidable threat in a confrontation.  

<br>

> ##### Beaver Dams
> A beaver dam is a wooden structure with an AC 16, and it can range in size from large to gargantuan.  Each large section has 27 (5d10) hit points and is immune to poison and psychic damage.

# Crocodilians

This amphibious family of reptilian predators excels at hunting creatures both in and out of the water.  Though their sizes vary, almost all crocodilians are ambush predators, waiting within the water and attacking unsuspecting prey that strays too close to the shoreline.  Once their victim is secure within their jaws, they will pull it out into the deep water, where it will have difficulty escaping

***Rip and Tear.***  Crocodilians have one of the strongest bite forces in the animal kingdom, capable of shattering bones with a single chomp.  However, for all its power, the jaw of a crocodilian cannot chew.  They overcome this shortcoming by combining their powerful bite with a "death roll."  When a creature is grappled within its jaws, the crocodilian will rapidly twist and spin its body in the water, allowing it to quickly disable and dismember its prey.

## Alligators
Smaller and faster than their crocodile cousins, alligators live in swampy environments and can withstand colder climates than the rest of their kin.  Reaching between 10 and 15 feet in length and weighing 500 pounds, alligators pose a significant hazard to swamp-dwelling humanoids.  Despite this, they are often hunted for their meat and valuable hides. 

***Favored Pets.*** Swamp-dwelling humanoids will sometimes keep alligators as pets or guard animals to protect their territory.  An isolated, misanthropic human might keep gators around his swamp shack, lizardfolk druids often create bonds with alligators living amongst their tribe, and hags may have alligator pets they dote on like spoiled puppies.

***Giant Alligators.*** Occasionally, especially large and monstrous alligators emerge to terrorize the swamps.  A giant alligator could result from magical enhancement, a member of a new subspecies, or simply a particularly old ornery gator that has grown especially large over the years.

Most subspecies of this smaller breed of crocodilian only grow to a modest length of 5 to 10 feet and generally stay under 100 pounds.  They live within the riverways of deep jungles and other tropical environments.

## Crocodiles
Reaching over 15 feet and weighing over 1000 pounds, these monstrous reptiles are the largest of all modern crocodilians.  They are the bane of any creature that must drink from or attempt to cross their river homes. 
Unlike alligators, crocodiles cannot tolerate colder climates and are regulated to tropical and desert waters.  But, unlike alligators, they can dwell in saltwater rivers and marshes.  

***Cold-Blooded Killers.*** Of all crocodilians, crocodiles are the most prone to attacking humanoids, actively hunting them down at watering holes, and few crocodiles can easily terrorize a small riverside village.  Some humanoids put these deadly predators to nefarious use.  Rivers and moats surrounding a lair can be filled with crocodiles to make these defenses extra deadly, and a crocodile-filled pit makes for a deadly trap and a gruesome way of disposing of prisoners.

***Saltwater Crocodiles.*** Saltwater crocodiles are the largest of all modern reptiles, ruling as the apex predators of the saltwater marshes where they live.  They are among the most aggressive crocodiles, and anyone who unwittingly stumbles into their territory is immediately viewed as prey.

***Giant Crocodiles.***  These nightmarish beasts are the subject of local myth and legend.    Some giant crocodiles make their lairs deep in long-lost jungle ruins and rivers far from civilization.  Others might be summoned by a vengeful druid or other force of nature, and the appearance of a single giant crocodile can drive a whole village out of its territory.

In some cultures, crocodiles are seen as divine figures tied to specific gods.  In these situations, a giant crocodile might appear at the behest of one or more gods.  They may be sent to test the metal of mortal champions, guard sacred locations, or enact divine punishment upon those who have displeased the gods.

## Deinosuchus
No creature is safe within the primeval rivers of these ancient crocodilians.  Growing to over 30 feet and weighing over 4 tons, the deinosuchus is a monster that eats other monsters, and it even counts dinosaurs such as the mighty tyrannosaurus amongst its prey.  May the gods have mercy on any fledgling adventurers that stray near its waters.

A deinosuchus encountered by humanoids is <br> treated as a creature of legend, subject to terror and veneration.  Lizardfolk hold a particular reverence for these ancient beasts.  A tribe that encounters a deinosuchus will likely worship it as a demigod, protecting it with their lives as they direct its primeval wrath upon their enemies.

## Gharials
These crocodilians are easily recognized by their long, slender jaws and bulbous nose.  Though they reach lengths similar to crocodiles at 10 to 20 feet, they are more petite, weighing less than most alligators at around 350 pounds.  

The slim gharial is the most hydrodynamic of all crocodilians, trading land speed for increased water mobility.  This mobility, combined with their long-reaching jaws, makes gharials excellent at catching fish, which serve as their primary food source.

Gharials are among the least aggressive of all the crocodilians towards humanoids.  Unless their young are being threatened, they are unlikely to attack humanoids unless they are being controlled by magical means, serving a druid or other nature spirit, or being driven mad by some corrupting force acting on their environment. 

> ##### Optional Rule: Tonic Immobility
> Crocodilians can be subjected to a condition called tonic immobility.  This occurs when the crocodilian is held on its back for 15-20 seconds, causing it to temporarily pass out.  If you wish to represent this in your games, you can have crocodilians who fall prone for 3 rounds fall unconscious before waking up after another 3 rounds.

# Demons of Change
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness but are as manipulative and deceitful as the demons of change.  These demons are born from the mortal desire to lie and distort the world around them.  These demons are the antithesis of truth and stability, continually changing themselves and the world around them in maddening ways.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to warp and manipulate humanoids.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of deceit and manipulation.  

***The Illusion of Reality.***  For demons of change, truth and reality are simply concepts to be twisted a manipulated.  The only constant in the multiverse is change, and no fact or certainty can withstand reality's constant metamorphosis.  All of existence is in a neverending state of becoming, and demons of change fully embrace this chaos.  They communicate in entirely contradictory ways, lying with every breath and constantly calling the knowledge and beliefs of others into question.  The psychological instability they induce extends to the material world, and a demon of change's presence destabilizes reality, causing objects to twist and bend in impossible ways.

***Architects of Fate.***  The pliable nature of reality leads demons of change to see it as something to be manipulated like a marionette.  They are schemers and manipulators, always looking for ways to bend fate in their favor.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They often tempt mortals with knowledge and hidden insights into the nature of reality, but these ploys are always manipulation serving a larger scheme.  These schemes are multilayered, with each lie part of a larger plot and each plot a piece of a grand conspiracy.  No matter how many layers of deceit are pulled back, there are still more manipulations at play, and attempting to understand how they all play into each other can drive a mortal mind mad.  Whether these schemes serve some grand plan or they are manipulation for manipulation's sake remains a mystery.

***Arcane Masters.***  Demons of change have an intrinsic connection to the nature of magic.  In many ways, magic is the epitome of what they represent. Magic manipulates reality to defy natural law, making the universe's rules ever more incomprehensible.  Even the lowliest demons of change can channel this arcane chaos to some extent, and the greatest among them are some of the mightiest mages in existence.  The magic these fiends wield is chaos in its purest form, and nothing it touches is safe from its reality-warping effects.  Mortals who attempt to study it risk subjecting their bodies to arcane mutations and their minds to a whirlwind of insanity.

> **Capricious Warpflame** Fire damage dealt by the flamer ignores fire resistance. Additionally, the first time a creature takes fire damage from the flamer each turn, it must make a DC 16 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature suffers a randomly determined mutation effect, described below. If the resulting mutation is already affecting the target, it suffers no new effects. At the end of the target's turns, it makes a DC 16 Charisma saving throw, ending all mutations affecting it on a success. 
>
> *1. Wild Spasms.*  The target can't take actions as its body jerks erratically in random directions. <Br> 
> *2. Degeneration.* The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage. <br>
> *3. Twisted Arms.*  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components. <br>
> *4. Inverted Eyes.*  The target is blinded. <br>
> *5. Gelatinous Legs.*  The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight.   At the end of each of its turns, its legs give out, causing it to fall prone again.<Br>
> *6. Regeneration.*   The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points
> 
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The flamer has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The flamer makes three Hurl Flame attacks.
>
> ***Hurl Flame .*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +8 to hit, range 100 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (6d6) fire damage. If the target is a flammable object that isn't being worn or carried, it also catches fire.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The flamer casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 16):
>
> At will: *aganazzar's scorcher (4th level)*, *burning hands (5th level)*
>

&emsp;***Flamers of Change.***  These bizarre demons are <br> malevolent embodiments of magic and its chaotic <br> nature.  Flamers of change float through the air, <br> with gouts of fire erupting from where their legs <br> would be, propelling them in any direction they <br> desire.  Their bodies shimmer with hues of blue <br> and purple while gnashing mouths and leering <br> eyes are haphazardly strewn across their forms. <br> The only limbs to present are two long arms ending <br> in twisted months.  Flamers derive their name from <br> the chaotic fires that erupt from their mouths, <br> known as warp flame.  This warp flame is not true <br> fire but chaos in its purest form and anything it <br> touches is subjected to rapid mutation as the orderly <br> laws of the multiverse are quickly broken down.

Flamers of change possess no guile and ambition <br> of their own.  They are more akin to magical <br> elementals than the other scheming demons of <br> change.  Flamers might spawn in locations where <br> other demons have wrought significant havoc on the <br> fabric of reality.  Other times, powerful demons or <br> deranged mortals summon flamers to sow chaos <br> amongst their enemies.  Only the most powerful of <br> wills can control a flamer of change, for once it is <br> set loose upon the world, it cares for nothing but <br> causing chaos for the sake of chaos.

***Horrors of Change.***  These unpredictable demons defy reason and understanding.  Horrors of change have no fixed form, and their bodies constantly writhe and twist into new shapes.  Faces appear and disappear while new limbs stretch out to propel the horror forward or grab at nearby enemies.  While these limbs can be used as potent weapons, the true threat from a horror comes from its innate magical abilities, which allow it to hurl devastating flames anyone and anything that strikes its fancy.

The primary incarnation of a horror of change is known as a pink horror as they are recognizable by their pinkish hue.   These fiends cackle with maniacal glee as they bound to and fro, burning and tearing apart whatever they please.  Their innate magical abilities are amplified when they gather in groups, allowing them to unleash devesting magical displays.  Nothing gratifies a pink horror more than seeing reality ripped apart in a show of chaotic magical destruction.  

Should a pink horror be slain, it will split into two blue horrors.  Unlike their giddy pink counterparts, blue horrors are sullen and irritable, blaming everything and everyone for their loss of status.  They vent their frustrations on their enemies, spitefully burning and tearing at anything they can.

The death of a blue horror still does not end the cycle of chaos, for they split into two brimstone horrors.  These small fiends are composed entirely of fire and spite.  Aware that they are the lowest ranking demons of change, they seek vengeance on the world, using what power they have to burn everything and everyone around them.

&emsp;***Lords of Change.*** These greater demons are masters of deceit and reality-shattering sorcery.  Lords of change appear to be large, anthropomorphic birds with massive wings and long, vulturous necks.  They often sport various mutations, with some even having two heads.  

These fiendish masterminds spend every hour of their existence gathering information and orchestrating grand schemes.  By playing on the hopes and ambitions of mortals, lords of change manipulate these lowly creatures like chess pieces on the great board of reality.  These supplicants believe they are being granted the knowledge to achieve their goals, but in truth, they are just puppets in a demon's intricate play.

The vast knowledge and innate magical nature of a lord of change make it one of the most powerful spell casters in the multiverse.  These fiends can perceive and manipulate the weave of magic as easily as a musician plays a favored instrument, and few mages can hope to compete with their mastery of spellcraft.

When the lord of change casts a spell with a range of touch, the range of that spell becomes 30 feet.
>
> ***Dual Minded.*** The lord of change can maintain concentration on two spells simultaneously and makes saves to maintain concentration on spells with advantage.  If it fails a concentration save while concentrating on two spells, it loses concentration on one of the spells of its choice.
>
> ***Improved Spell Casting.*** When the lord of change casts a spell that requires it to make an ability check as a part of casting that spell (such as counterspell or dispel magic), it adds its proficiency bonus to that ability check.
>

If the target fails, it dies and instantly transforms into a **pink horror of change** at full health under the lord of change's control.  This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell or a *true polymorph* spell that lasts its full duration.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Dimensional Shift.*** The lord of change teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The lord of change makes three attacks: one with its 
Baleful Sword, one with its beak, and one with its Staff of Change. It can replace up to one of its attacks with an at will spell.

# Lore of Change
Spellcasters wielding magic of change favor spells of transformation, trickery, and chaos. While many existing D&D spells can represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this unpredictable style of sorcery into your campaigns.

#### Bolt of Change
*4th-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M, (A caterpillar cocoon)
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You launch a bolt of pure chaos at a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 4d10 force damage and must make a Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the target suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below.  The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending all mutations affecting it on a success.  A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

\columnbreak

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight. At the end of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|



***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.

\pagebreakNum

#### Chaos Storm
*9th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of demon ichor)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___
You open a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction.  A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered on a point within range that lasts for the spell's duration.  This sphere is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away.  No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures fully within the area are blinded and deafened.  A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

Any creature that enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw.  It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  Any nonmagical object that is not bearing worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage at the start of your turn.  A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by this damage is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift.  A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

On each of your turns, until the spell ends, you can use your action to open another gateway, targeting point within 100 feet of the original gate.  A creature in the area of more than one gateway is only affected once.  You can also close a gateway as a bonus action or as a reaction to a creature entering its area.

If you drop concentration on the spell early, make a DC 20 ability check using your spellcasting ability.  On a failure, you open another gate centered on yourself, and the spell continues for its full duration outside of your control.  During this time, you can no longer open additional gateways or close existing ones, and the radius of each existing gateway expands by 10 feet at the start of each of your turns.


#### Glean Magic
*3rd-level divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You reach deep into the mind of a spell caster you can see in range and attempt to steal their magic.  The target must make an Intelligence saving throw which it can choose to fail.  On a failed save, you can attempt to steal a spell of 3rd level or lower the target knows.

Name the spell you wish to steal from the creature.  If the creature does not know that spell, the DM chooses a spell the creature knows at random of the same level.  If the creature knows no other spells of the same level, the DM chooses a spell at random of one level lower.  Repeat this process until a spell is stolen or there are no possible spells to steal, in which case the spell fails.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

If a spell is successfully stolen, the target loses a spell slot of the spell's level and the ability to cast that spell for 1 hour.  If the target prepares spells at the beginning of the day or can cast the spell a certain number of times per day innately, the target loses one use of the spell.

After stealing a spell, you gain the ability to cast it once as though it were from the same class spell list you used to cast this spell.  When you cast it this way, it does not expend a spell slot, and you cast it at the same spell level at which it was stolen.  You must still supply the stolen spell's required components (including verbal, somatic, and material).  You lose the stolen spell after completing a long rest.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can attempt to steal a spell if its level is less than or equal to the level of the spell slot you used to cast this spell.

## Demons of Change in Your Adventures
The demons in this document can be adapted to fit any setting in which demons seek to manipulate mortals and distort reality.  In more traditional Dungeons and Dragons settings, they could even serve other demon lords such as Fraz-Urb'luu or the Demogorgon.  The following tables provide you with examples of ways to incorporate these demons into your adventures.

##### Flamer of Change Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Flamers of change** keep appearing at seemingly random locations to wreak havoc before disappearing as quickly as they arrived, and no one knows the cause.  |
|  2  |A magical experiment gone awry warped a group of wizarding students into **flamers of change** that now rampage through their university.  |
|  3  | In a desperate attempt to ward off an angry mob, a mad sorcerer has torn a hole in reality, unleashing a horde of **flamers of change**.   |
|  4  |  A demon lord has unleased **flamers of change** upon an unsuspecting settlement to study their effect on the Material Plane and its inhabitants.  |
|  5  | A crumbling portal sits in deep inside forgotten ruins.  It appears inactive, but occasionally a **flamer of change** will flit out from its threshold.|

# Demons of Decay
Demons represent the dark, chaotic <br> impulses of humanity made manifest. <br> Different demons represent different <br> aspects of this darkness, but none are <br> as revolting as the demons of decay. <br>  These demons are born from the <br> tendency of mortals to neglect <br> themselves and the world they live in, thus allowing <br> disease and entropy to run their course unopposed. <br> In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to <br> spread plagues and decay.  On others, they act in service to <br> a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of rot and disease.   

***Unnatural Vitality.*** Demons of decay are easily recognized by their bloated, rotting, disease-ridden forms.  The decaying nature of their bodies does not mean these fiends are fragile or easy to slay.  Demons of decay can shrug off incredible amounts of punishment relative to their size while their would-be slayers slowly succumb to terrible afflictions.  Many who worship these demons do so in hopes of gaining this unnatural vitality, even if it means subjecting themselves to horrific rot and disease.

***Cheerful Nihilists.***  Demons of decay represent the inevitable deterioration of all things.  Those who have succumbed to nihilism and apathy are especially vulnerable to their influence.  Yet, these demons and their followers are almost always jolly and cheerful.  They revel in the pointlessness of life and celebrate the perpetual state of rot to which existence is subject.  Those who worship these fiends often seek a means of escaping despair and fear of death, and by accepting the gifts of rot and disease, these worshippers cheerfully shed all their worries and woes.

***Promoters of Life.***  The dark irony of these fiends is their genuine love of life.  They hold a motherly love for all living things, including diseases and parasites, which they fail to see as any less important than other lifeforms.  These fiends cast no judgments on the intrinsic worth of any lifeform and hold a deadly parasite in just as much esteem as a humanoid whom they believe should provide a home for as many parasites as possible.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They spread diseases not out of malice but out of a desire to see life thrive, even if it is in the form of a plague.  Those who resist diseases, or worse, cure them, are seen as cruel destroyers of life by these fiends and their followers.  Death and decay are inevitable, and the best one can do is provide a loving home for as many other forms of life as possible while letting go of the need to hold onto what can't be maintained.

&emsp;***Beasts of Decay.***  These disgusting and ungainly <br> fiends lurch across the ground with their slug-like <br> bodies, bringing rot and death to everyone in their <br> path.  The beast's legless lower body is topped with <br> a vaguely humanoid upper body, and its head features <br> a slobbering tongue and leech-like hair that constantly <br> spews toxins.  Though their bodies appear bloated and awkward, beasts of decay have no trouble pulling <br> themselves toward any creature that catches their <br> attention, leaving a trail of acidic slime in their wake. 

Despite the beast of decay's horrid appearance and <br> deadly nature, it is a jovial and affectionate fiend, <br> virtually incapable of viewing any other creature as <br> an enemy.  "Enemies" are simply potential  <br> playmates, and the beast is eager to earn their  <br> affection with big slobbering licks.  The fact that  <br> these licks rot, kill, and bring untold suffering to <br> their "playmates" is beyond the beast's understanding.  <br>  A creature killed this way is transformed into another  <br> demon of decay, thus providing the beast with a more permanent playmate.

***Great Unclean Ones.***  These jolly greater demons  <br> are masters of rot and disease, which they happily <br> spread to anyone they meet.  They have the appearance  <br> of massive, bloated corpses with entrails spilling forth  <br> from their open wounds and slimy horns topping their grinning, oversized heads.   This enormous body constantly oozes acidic slime and debilitating gasses, and its rotting girth makes it difficult to meaningfully damage.  Once it is in motion, the unclean one can easily crush other creatures under the momentum of its vile flesh, all while laughing merrily.

&emsp;Unclean ones wield rusted and decaying weapons, crusted with filth and disease, and their dreaded plague flails deliver an affliction that can transform victims into new demons of decay.  Enemies outside the reach of an unclean one's weapons are no safer, for these fiends can vomit streams of rotting bile over ridiculous distances.  These deadly combat abilities are supplemented by the unclean one's powerfully putrescent magic, which specializes in rotting and poisoning enemies as well as restoring vitality to its fellow demons.  

While an unclean one's presence inevitably brings death and decay, it behaves as though it is at a grand party.  There is a joyousness to its actions, and its diseases, spells, and attacks are simply how it spreads good cheer.  The unclean one has a parental fondness for its followers, and those who have given themselves over to the influence of these demons view their afflictions as loving presents.  Together they spread their pestilent gifts far and wide as they revel in the decay of all things.

***Plaguebearer of Decay.***  These fiends are created from the souls of mortals who have succumbed to demonic diseases.  Their shambling humanoid bodies are bloated, rotten, and nearly zombie-like in appearance, though they can be distinguished from other undead by their cyclopean visage, which is topped with a single knarled horn.  Each of these fiends wields a rusted plaguesword, which carries the same disease that originally birthed it and is used to continue the proliferation of its kind. 

Plaguebearers feel the responsibility not just to spread disease but to count and catalog all diseases they encounter in hopes of establishing a complete record of every pathogen in existence.  Despite the impossible nature of this task, these neurotic fiends can often be heard counting illnesses they spot on the battlefield, groaning in frustration every time a distraction causes them to lose count.

> ***Fetid Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the plague bearer must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, but not both, and it can't take reactions.

> ### Actions
>
> ***Plaguesword.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become infected by the sword's diseases.  Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while it is infected, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.  This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest.  The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0, at which point it is instantly transformed into a plague bearer.  This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

# Lore of Decay
Spellcasters wielding magic of decay favor <br> spells that inflict rot, disease, and entropy. <br> While many existing D&D spells can <br> represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing this putrescent style of sorcery into your campaigns.

####  Inflict Rot
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Cleric, Warlock
___

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, it takes 3d10 necrotic damage and is afflicted with a disease that lasts until the spell ends.

A creature afflicted by this disease takes 3d10 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and must then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. 

If a diseased creature drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can end the disease on the creature and cause it to unleash a wave of rot. Each creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. You may choose to have one of the creatures that failed the saving throw become infected with the same disease, which lasts for the remainder of the spell's duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, each time it would deal damage, it deals an additional 1d10 necrotic damage for each slot level above 4th.

#### Miasma of Pestilence
*1st-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 20 feet
- **Components:** V S M (A bit of durian fruit)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Wizard
___

A cloud of putrescent vapor appears in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is lightly obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration or until a moderate wind (at least 5 miles per hour) disperses it after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.

Each creature completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the target can take either an action or a bonus action on its turn, not both, and can't take reactions. Creatures that don't need to breathe automatically succeed on this saving throw.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Puddle of Ooze
*3rd-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of slug slime)
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid, Sorcerer 
___

You cover the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range with acidic ooze, causing it to become difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 1d4 acid damage for every 5 feet it travels.

When the ooze appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 3d4 acid damage.

#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the necrotic damage dealt to targeted creatures and creatures in the area of the cone of bile by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Demons of Decay in Your Adventures
The demons in this document can be adapted to fit any setting where fiends carry disease and seek to spread rot and entropy.  In more traditional Dungeons and Dragons settings, they could serve other demon lords such as Orcus or Zuggtmoy, though they would likely be less jovial in this case.  The following tables provide examples of ways to incorporate these demons into your adventures. 

##### Beast of Decay Adventures

| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | A mad cultist takes her pet **beast of decay** out on walks in the dead of night.  Anyone who crosses their path is subject to its deadly affection.  |

# Demons of Excess
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness, but none are so tempting as the demons of excess.  These demons are born from the mortal desire to overindulge in life's earthly pleasures.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to tempt and corrupt humanoids.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of excess and obsession.   

***Hedonistic Allure.*** Unlike other demons, these fiends often present themselves as friendly to mortals, offering to aid them in achieving whatever gratification they desire.  Wherever they go, these fiends seek to drive mortals to self-destructive levels of debauchery.  If time and circumstance allow, this corruption can be done subtly as the demons work their influence across one or more individuals, slowly driving their victims to commit more and more depraved acts.  Over time, the victim's ability to delay any form of gratification wanes away, leaving behind a self-indulgent hedonist.  

\columnbreak

In combat, these demons can unleash their supernatural allure in a much less subtle way to temporarily impair and charm their enemies.  The fiends will use this tactic to reduce the number of combatants they face while swiftly dispatching any who resist their charms.  

***Ecstasy In Pain*** While demons of excess prefer to undo their victims using their tempting charms, they are more than capable of dismembering their enemies.  When the situation calls, these fiends can move with incredible speed, closing the distance between themselves and a foe in the blink of an eye.  Their attacks are made with equal speed, and their agility makes them difficult to strike.  Regardless of how quickly they move, their motions are always made with sensual grace.

Even when excess demons resort to direct violence, their attacks are laced with perverse pleasure.  These demons blur pleasure and pain and their victims often moan with ecstatic agony even as they are ripped limb from limb.  Each of these demons' movements is made with erotic grace, and they relish every bit of pain they can inflict.  They even appear to take masochistic pleasure in their own pain, and will squeal in ecstasy as they are slain.

&emsp;***Demonettes.*** These hermaphroditic fiends feature a bizarre combination of alluring and grotesque features.  Their lithe, graceful bodies are humanoid in form but include demonic mutations such as horns, hooves, and crustation-like claws.  While these features should be repulsive, demonettes possess a supernatural charm that causes onlookers to view them as paragons of beauty and desire.  Demonettes can combine their charms to quickly undo the will of their foes.  The fiends will then ravage their helpless victims who remain enamored by their attackers even as they are torn apart.

> ___
>  ***Charming Aura.*** Any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of one or more demonettes must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by all demonettes within 10 feet. While a creature charmed this way, it is incapacitated. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if there aren't any demonettes within 10 feet of the creature at the end of any turn. The save DC for this effect increases by 2 for each demonette within 10 feet of the target, up to a maximum of DC 18. Once the creature makes a successful saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the charming aura of all aemonettes for 1 hour.
>
> ***Evasion.*** When the demonette makes a Dexterity
saving throw to reduce the damage of an effect by half, it
instead takes no damage on a success and only half
damage on a failure

>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

Daemonettes often serve as the primary servants for demonic lords of excess.  They can fulfill the role of spies, assassins, and foot soldiers.  Daemonettes are also dispatched to seduce and corrupt powerful individuals, bringing them under the sway of their demonic master.  

When they are not actively pursuing the agenda of their master, daemonettes exist to serve their master's every whim.  They are often found in the lairs of powerful demon lords, where they act as handmaidens, consorts, and guards.  When their master goes into battle, these sycophantic fiends eagerly join the fray, laying their lives down in hopes of earning favor with their fickle lord.

>  ***Soporific Musk.*** Any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 20 feet of one or more fiends of excess must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of the *slow* spell until the end of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Soporific Musk of all fiends of excess for 1 hour. The save DC for this effect increases by 2 for each fiend of excess within 20 feet of the target, up to a maximum DC of 20.  
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The fiend makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its sting. 
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). The fiend has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 11 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious until the poisoned condition ends. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect.

&emsp;***Fiends of Excess.*** These obscene fiends combine lewd human features with a mutated bestial form.  Fiends of <br> excess gallop at high speeds, their long tongues tasting <br> the air as they search for prey.  Their unfortunate victims <br> must not only contend with powerful claws but a nubile scorpion-like tail.  The poison from the tail's stinger <br> numbs the senses to the point where many victims fall unconscious.  Fiends of excess use this opportunity to toy with their new playthings, ravaging their helpless prey <br> with cruel wounds.  Those who awaken are racked with <br> pain as sensation rushes back, their final moments <br> filled with agony as the fiend gleefully tears apart and <br> eats its victim alive.

Fiends of excess often serve as favored pets and war<br> beasts for more powerful demon lords of excess.  When unleashed upon enemy forces, they sing disturbing <br> melodies that disrupt the minds of any who hear them, impairing the ability to concentrate on spells.  Opponents <br> who engage the fiends in melee combat fair no better, <br> and they soon find themselves overwhelmed by a coying musk that leaves them sluggish and unresponsive.  These fiends relish the chaos and disruption they sow and <br> gracefully dance through enemy ranks picking apart <br> targets with surgical precision.

&emsp;***Keeper of Secrets.***
These greater demons are paragons of unfettered desire and destructive obsession.  The forms they assume are varied, but they are all huge fiends with vaguely humanoid forms that feature an amalgam of male, female, and bestial features.  These bodies sport arms that end in diamond-sharp claws, and they move at such speed in combat they appear to be a blur of motion.

These fiends drive mortals to push every experience to the extreme, and those under their influence lose themselves in pursuit of new sensations and experiences.  These pursuits may begin with frenzied artistic creation or the indulgence of forbidden pleasures, but they soon devolve into depraved acts of self-gratification and sadism. 

Keepers of secrets eagerly partake in the cruel, hedonistic frenzy using their elegant great blades to masterfully cut a swath through awed onlookers, each slice moving with the grace of a dancer and each blood splatter painting the ground with the aesthetic precision of an artist.  Even those who resist their charms find themselves facing a martial master capable of wielding overwhelmingly seductive  magics.

The effect also ends if there aren't any keepers of secrets within 30 feet of the creature at the end of any turn. 
>
> Once the creature makes a successful saving throw against this effect, it is immune to the charming aura of all keepers of secrets for 1 hour.
>
> ***Distant Caster.*** When the keeper casts a spell with a range of 5 feet or greater, the range of that spell is doubled.
When the keeper casts a spell with a range of touch, the range of that spell becomes 30 feet.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The keeper has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The keeper makes four attacks: two with its 
Elegant Greatblade and two with its claws. Alternatively, it makes two 
attacks with its claws and casts one at will spell.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is 
a large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 21). The keeper has two claws, each of which can grapple only 
one target. 
>
> ***Elegant Greatblade.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 27 (6d6 + 6) slashing damage.
>
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The keeper casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 21):
>
> At will: *cacophonic caress**, *charm monster*, *command*, *dispel magic*, *enthrall*, *nystul's magic aura*(self only), *slicing shards**<br>
> 1/day each:  *dominate monster*, *glibness*, *hypnotic pattern*, *otto's irresistible dance*, *phantasmagoria**, *project image* <br><br>
> *Spells described later in this document
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Instinctive Charm.*** When a creature the keeper can see within 120 feet of it makes an attack roll against it, the attacker must make a DC 21 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must target another creature within range of the attack other than the keeper. If multiple creatures are within range, the attacker chooses which one to target. If no other creatures are within range of the attack, the attack is wasted.

# Lore of Excess
Spellcasters wielding magic of excess favor spells that induce indulgence, pain, pleasure, some perverse combination of all three. While many existing D&D spells can represent this magic, the following new spells provide even more ways of bringing his profane style of sorcery into your campaigns.


#### Cacophonic Caress
*3rd-level  evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You throw back your head and emit an ululating scream.  Each creature within range takes 3d6 thunder damage and must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 3d6 additional psychic damage and be deafened for 1 minute.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much psychic damage and isn't deafened.  A creature deafened this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.


#### Phantasmagoria
*6th-level  illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Warlock
___

You summon illusory creatures who flit and broil within a 30 foot radius sphere centered on a point within range you can see.  The creatures whisper dark promises of fulfillment, seducing and bewildering hapless foes.  You can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by the spell. An affected creature in the area of the spell suffers <br> disadvantage on Charisma, Intelligence, Wisdom saving throws and Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. The spell ends if you move more than <Br>  60 feet away from the area under its effect.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Slicing Shards
*4th-level  conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of broken glass)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a cloud of razor-sharp glass capable of slicing through mind and body and send it flying toward a creature within range.  Make a ranged spell attack against the target.  On a hit, the target takes 10d4 slashing damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw.  The target takes 10d4 additional psychic damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one.  If the attack misses, the glass grazes the target, and it takes half as much of the initial slashing damage and does not make the Wisdom saving throw or take any additional psychic damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, both the slashing and psychic damage increase by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.

## Demons of Excess in Your Adventures
The demons in this document can be adapted to fit any setting in which fiends work to tempt and corrupt mortals through offerings of pleasure and excess.

# Demons of Rage
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness, but none are so brutal as the demons of rage.  These demons are born from the innate aggression of mortals, and thrive in times of war.  They are the living embodiments of rage, bloodlust, and warmongering.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently, rampaging across existence in their endless desire for battle and bloodshed.  On others, they serve as soldiers to one or more mighty demon lords or demonic gods who preside over the domains of rage, blood, and conquest.     

***Call to War.*** While most demons are known for brutality and murder, demons of rage embody these aspects in their purest form.  War and aggression are their succor, and these fiends incite mortals into bloody conflict wherever they roam.  While demons of rage are more than eager enough to wage war directly, their presence alone drives mortals to greater levels of aggression and brutality.  Under the influence of these demons, armies lose all restraint, once peaceful villages are consumed in bloody riots, and people across the land rally for war.  

\columnbreak

<br>

&emsp;***Brutal and Direct.***  Demons of rage eschew indirect tactics such as guile, deception, or sorcery.  They view these methods as a sign of weakness and despise all who employ them.  Demons of rage engage their enemies head-on, relying on overwhelming aggression and superior strength at arms to crush their foes.  While these fiends are not stupid and possess masterful skills in combat, they rarely allow the niceties of complex battlefield tactics to interfere with their need for brutal slaughter.

***Hatred of Magic.***  While many demons utilize innate arcane abilities to achieve their depraved ends, demons of rage condemn the use of magic.  To them, spellcraft is a cowardly and despicable substitute for martial prowess, and these demons only utilize magic in the form of enchanted arms and armor.  The disdain for magic these demons hold is reflected in how easily they can shrug off any sorcery that would attempt to subdue them.  Demons of rage have an innate resistance to magical effects, and they often forge armaments that help them negate any spells that would deny them glorious, unimpeded combat.

***Bloodletters.***  These demonic warriors sport massive horns, blood-red hides, and a skull-like visage whose eyes burn with endless rage.  Bloodletters wield mighty hellblades with brutal skill and often serve as demonic footsoldiers.  They attack with unrestrained brutality, feeding off the aggression and violence of combat.  Bloodletters fighting together will drive each other to greater heights of hatred, cutting through enemies in a maddened frenzy

Bloodletters often make up the bulk of demonic armies in service to demon lords of war and hatred.  In some worlds, they slaughter in the name of a specific master, while in others, they serve as demonic footsoldiers utilized by multiple demon lords.  

Bloodletters are often encountered in small roving warbands but can sometimes form the backbone of world-ending demonic armies.   While they are deadly and unrelenting warriors, their single-minded need for slaughter usually prohibits them from performing complex long-term strategies.  For bloodletters, combat is an end unto itself.

***Blood Thirsters.*** 
These greater demons are the <br> mightiest embodiments of war and hatred in <br> existence.  They tower over the battlefield, <br> snarling hound-like faces striking terror in the <br> enemy as their mighty wings carry them into melee <br> range. When blood thirsters move across land, they <br> devastate the earth itself with their presence, each <br> step rending the ground and leaving a burning trail <br> of hellfire.  Once in striking distance, they cut a swath  <br>through their foes with massive demonic blades, <br> slaughtering entire regiments of enemies in a few <br> bloody moments.

Blood thirsters act as fiendish warlords, often <br> leading demonic armies in search of glory and <br> slaughter.  They may serve more powerful demonic <br> entities or act independently, but in either case, they <br> often command lesser demons of rage.  While the <br> chaotic nature of demons usually prevents them <br> from organizing in sophisticated ways, blood <br> thirsters possess a brutal authority and instinct for <br> battle tactics, allowing them to direct their murderous <br> hordes to execute sophisticated tactics beyond their typical capabilities.  Once battle is joined, the presence of the blood thirster alone is enough to drive all combatants into a frenzy.  Once orderly soldiers quickly succumb to chaotic bloodlust, and all restraint is swept away in the whirlwind of war.

>
> ***Spell Breaker*** At the start of each of the blood thirster's turns, it can end one spell of 6th level or lower of its choice affecting it or a creature within 10 feet of it that it can see. It can do this even while incapacitated.
>
> ***The Land Rebels.*** The blood thirster ignores difficult terrain.  Additionally, any ground the blood thirster moves through becomes difficult terrain and is set ablaze with fire for the next minute.  Any non-demon creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there, takes the 10(3d6) fire damage.
>
> ***Weapons of Fury.*** Any weapon the bloodthirster is wielding becomes magical for long as it wields it, and blood thirster can't be disarmed of the weapon.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Aggressive.*** The blood thirster moves up to its speed toward a hostile creature it can see.
>
> ***Cleave.***  When the blood thirster reduces a creature to 0 hit points with its Greataxe of Fury on its turn, it can make another attack with this weapon.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The blood thirster makes three attacks.
>
> ***Greataxe of Fury.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (3d12 + 7) slashing damage. If the target is concentrating on a spell, it has disadvantage on the saving throw it makes to maintain concentration resulting from this attack.
>
> ***War Whip.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 20 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage. The target must make a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pulled 30 feet towards the blood thirster.
>
> ***Whirlwind of Rage.*** The blood thirster makes a Greataxe of Fury attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of it, with a separate attack roll for each target. The area within 10 feet of the bloodthirster is then affected by its The Land Rebels feature.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Vengeful Charge.*** When the blood thirster is hit by an attack or a creature cast a spell that forces it to make a saving throw to resist its effects, the blood thirster can move up to half its speed towards the creature without provoking opportunity attacks. The blood thirster can then make a melee weapon attack against that creature with advantage if it is within 10 feet of it.

>
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage.
>
> ***Burning Roar (Recharge 5–6).*** The hound lets out a roar that burns the air in a 15-foot cone in front of it.  Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage plus 14 (4d6) thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Flesh Hounds.*** These fiends are literal dogs of war.  They have the appearance of blood-red canines with demonic features whose fanged maws glow with infernal heat.  They charge across the field of battle in bloodthirsty hunting packs, constantly searching for their next victims.  The demonic howl of a flesh hound boils the air, cooking entire regiments of foes in an instant.  Wounded survivors are then set upon with claws and teeth capable of crushing through armor, and any who attempt to flee are quickly hunted down and ripped to bloody shreds.

Flesh hounds are often used as beasts of war and hunting dogs by demonic masters.  Unfortunate souls who have earned the ire of such a demon may find themselves pursued by these tireless hunters.  For once a flesh hound gets the scent of its prey, it does not rest until its quarry's mangled body is delivered to its master.

To ensure no magic interferes with the flesh hound's hunt, each fiend is fitted with a runic collar that wards off spellcraft.  Flesh hounds have a special hatred for magic users and are trained to prioritize the slaughter of such individuals.  In battle, demonic commanders often use flesh hounds as anti-magic minions, utilizing their mobility and magic resistance to quickly run down and shred enemy mages before they can interfere with combat.

## Demons of Rage in Your Adventures
The demons in this document can be adapted to fit any setting which features bloodthirsty, warmongering demons.  In more traditional Dungeons and Dragons settings, they could serve as demonic warriors spawned to fight in the Blood War or as minions in service to one of the more warmongering demon lords such as Baphomet.  The following tables provide you with examples of ways to incorporate these demons into your adventures.

##### Bloodletter Adventures

## Fester Gnaw

These horrible fiends revel in twisting and destroying ecosystems through deforestation and blocking critical waterways.  Though they appear to be monstrously oversized beavers, they are demonic in nature.  Their slavering jaws contain massive teeth capable of cutting through trees and bones with equal ease, their bodies are covered in bony spines, and their eyes gleam with malevolent intelligence.

***River Desecration.*** Groups of fester gnaws may arise as the result of beavers being exposed to abyssal energies or warped by demon lords, or they may claw their way to the material plane straight from the Abyss.  Though their destructiveness is not as immediately obvious as that of other demons, in many ways, it is far more insidious.  Fester gnaws will quickly find woodland towns near freshwater sources and begin ravaging the land nearby, cutting down trees and desecrating the forest upstream from the unwitting humanoid settlements.  Once they have harvested enough lumber, they will construct a log dam which they can use to block and redirect the river, or worse, befoul its waters, causing it to carry corruption and sickness downstream.

***Terror of Druids.*** Fester gnaws are quite adept at overcoming druid conclaves and the many creatures that work with them.  Demonic cultists seeking to destroy druidic guardians and defile their homelands will often summon fester gnaws to snuff out these enemies, ensuring they will no longer pose a threat to their grander schemes.

***Festering Wounds.***  The fester gnaw's teeth drip with fiendish corruption.  When they bite through trees, they inflict the wood with this corruption.  The tainted dams they build from this corrupt wood then spread the corruption into the waters that rush past these foul structures.  When fester gnaws bite other creatures, they can directly apply this corruption to their victims, inflicting them with festering wounds.  Festering wounds quickly rot a creature from the inside, and creatures suffering from multiple wounds succumb at an accelerated rate.  

\columnbreak

Creatures who lack heartiness or immediate medical attention quickly dissolve into gooey, rotten remains as they succumb to the fester gnaw's corruption.

***Foul Damnation.*** Fester gnaw dams are structures of horrendous evil.  They are comprised of the corrupted wood harvested from the surrounding area as well as the bodies and bones of any creatures that attempted to interfere with the dam's construction.  At the dam's center is a demonic altar serving as the focus of the fester gnaws' corruption.  The most potent of these altars are constructed using the remains of a treant or similar sacred forest creature.  These alters can spring to life to defend the dam if it is under attack, and their destruction is required to put an end to the dam for good.

#### Regional Effects
Fester Gnaws that successfully construct a dam with an altar corrupt any water flowing through that dam.  The waters remain corrupted for one day or until they flow 10 miles away from the dam.  The corrupted water has the following properties:

* The water keeps creatures from adequately healing and causes them to become more susceptible to sickness.  Any creature that is not undead or a demon and is submerged in the water has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws.  Additionally, medicine checks used on it are made with disadvantage, and if it receives healing, it only regains half the hit points it normally would.

* Creatures that are not undead or demons that consume the water must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become diseased.  Every 24 hours that elapse while diseased, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 3 (1d6) on a failure or curing the disease on a success.  The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0.  This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.  If a creature succeeds on a saving throw against the disease, it is immune to its effects for the next 24 hours.

#### Lair Actions
When fighting inside their dams, any fester gnaw can invoke their home's ambient magic to take lair actions.  Only one fester gnaw can take a lair action per round.  On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), any fester gnaw can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects: 

* Corrupted wooden spikes spring up to fill a 5-foot cube within 60 feet of the fester gnaw.  Until initiative count 20 on the next round, the area is difficult terrain.  During this time, creatures that enter the area for the first time or start their turn there take 3d4 piercing damage, and if the creature is not a demon, it gains a festering wound (see the fester gnaw stat block for the details of this effect).

* Demonic energy spews out from a creature afflicted with any number of festering wounds.  A creature within 60 feet of the fester gnaw takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage for each festering wound afflicting it.

<br>

* A wall made of wooden logs sprouts at any point within the dam.  The wall is made up of a wooden 20-foot by 10-foot panel 6 inches thick.  It has an AC 12, 20 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to psychic damage.  If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (the fester gnaw chooses which side).

### Gnawed Effigies

After a fester gnaw infestation takes root and they complete their foul lodge, they will often construct a demonic figure to act as a lair guardian and locus for their corruptive power. These figures are often stitched together from gnawed hunks of wood or carved from the corpses of slain treants. Once the effigy has been built, the fester gnaws perform a blasphemous ritual, channeling their corruptive demonic energy into the figure until it is animated with a semblance of fiendish life.

The gnawed effigy spends most of its time standing silent and still within the fester gnaw's lair. Only under extreme circumstances will they call it out of the lodge. The gnawed effigy's primary role is to serve as a focus for the corruptive energies of the demonic beavers and to act as a guardian when their lodge is under attack.

In combat, the mighty effigy skewers its foes with its befouled limbs and sprays volleys of corrupted wooden shrapnel across those who would intrude upon the territory of the fester gnaws. The effigy is unrelenting in its assault, and its attacks inflict its victims with the festering corruption of its demonic creators. Slaying the effigy is as difficult as surviving its vicious assault, for it derives unholy vitality from the corruption of those around it, stitching together its wounds and regrowing itself as it absorbs the dark energy radiating from those inflicted with its festering wounds.

### Gunk Spawn

When fester gnaws invade a forest, everything begins to decay. Plant and animal life becomes sickly and takes on a sallow slimy complexion as it withers away. When the plant or animal finally expires, its body dissolves into a slimy morass. If enough of this slime congeals together, it can take on a life of its own. This gunk spawn is made up of the slimy dissolved material of the many lives consumed by the corruption of the fester gnaws, and it oozes across its befouled environment with the singular purpose of spreading its corruption to everything it comes in contact with. 

When the gunk spawn encounters other creatures, it slowly lurches towards its targets, vomiting forth a spray of vile sludge as soon as they are in range. If it can reach its victim, the gunk spawn repeatedly slams it until the target succumbs to its corruptive wounds. Should the targets manage to slay the gunk spawn, they will still be subjected to one final burst of toxic ooze before they are rid of the horrid abomination.

# Dogs

These loyal creatures are some of the most common animals found living and working alongside humanoids. Though they come in many shapes and sizes, dogs are renowned for the bonds they form with their humanoid owners and the reliability with which they can be trained and commanded. They can be found throughout the societies of many different types of humanoids and across many cultures, serving valued and beloved roles.

Descended from wolves, dogs diverged into various breeds, all specialized in different tasks. From small dogs for hunting vermin to preceptive tracking hounds, vicious guard dogs, and agile herding dogs, humanoids have bred dogs to fill every role possible. Different mixed breeds may even result in hounds with unusual combinations of abilities, such as nimble dogs capable of dragging down larger opponents or sled dogs with keen senses able to detect dangers from a great distance.

Some dog breeds even possess magical traits. These traits may result from living in an innately magical environment, interbreeding with supernatural creatures, or arcane experiments. These exotic breeds are often found serving supernatural beings or living with non-human races, particularly those with ties to the Feywild, such as elves and gnomes.

To create custom dogs representing different breeds, you can apply any of the following traits to a dog stat block. For every three traits you apply, increase its CR by one level. Some traits are more powerful and count as applying more than one trait for this purpose. Traits should be applied in groups of three to keep the power levels of dogs of the same CR consistent. 

**Agile.** The dog has proficiency in Dexterity saving throws and increases the Dexterity bonus to its AC by +1.

**Gripping Bite.** The dog's bite grapples on hit (escape DC equal to the Strength save DC from its bite attack.) Until this grapple ends, the dog can't bite another target.

**Guardian.** Immediately after a creature within 5 feet of the dog takes the Disengage action or hits a target other than the dog with an attack, the dog can make an opportunity attack against that creature.

**Tough.** The dog has proficiency in Constitution saving throws, and its hit points are increased by 4.

**Pack Tactics (counts as 2 traits).** The dog has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dog's allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**Powerful.** The dog has proficiency in Strength saving throws and is one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.

**Rat Hunter.** The dog can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing. It also has advantage on attacks against tiny-sized creatures or swarms made up of tiny creatures, and it ignores the damage resistance of tiny creatures or swarms made of tiny creatures.

**Team Initiator.** Immediately after the dog rolls for initiative, it can swap its result with the result of one willing ally that also rolled initiative for the same combat. It can't make this swap if it or the ally is incapacitated.

**Tracker.** The dog has expertise in Perception and can detect creatures up to 10 miles away with its smell.

**Strong Willed.** The dog has proficiency in Wisdom saving throws, and it has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

**Swift.** The dog's walking speed increases by 10 feet.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

**Swimmer.** The dog has a swim speed of 30 feet.

**Watchdog.** The dog has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised.


### Magical Dog Traits
These traits are supernatural in nature and can be used to make dogs with magical abilities. 

**Fey Hunter.** If a creature is hit by the dog's bite attack, then until the start of that creature's next turn, if it tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel, it must first make a Charisma saving throw (DC equal to the Strength save DC from the dog's bite attack.) On a success, the creature can use that magic. On a failure, the creature can't teleport and wastes the use of the spell or effect. 

**Homing Sense (Counts as 2 traits).** If the dog is given possession of a garment or body part (such as a lock of hair or a nail clipping) to smell, it knows the direction and distance to the original owner of the item as long as that creature is within 50 miles. The dog can have only have one such quarry at a time.

**Two-Headed (Counts as 3 traits).** The dog has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. It can also make two bite attacks as an action and can grapple two creatures at once.

**Smell Evil and Good (Counts as 2 traits).** The dog is under the effects of the *detect evil and good* spell at all times.

**Smell Magic (Counts as 2 traits)**. The dog is under the effects of the *detect magic* spell at all times, except it uses its sense of smell rather than sight to detect magical effects.

**Spirit Hunter.** The dog's bite attacks are magical. The dog may also grapple and knock prone incorporeal creatures that would otherwise be immune to the grappled and prone conditions.

**Supernatural Senses.** The dog's senses are considered magical for the purposes of spells and effects, such as *pass without trace*, that prevent tracking through non-magical means.

**Wings (Counts as 2 traits).** The dog has wings which grant it a flying speed of 40 feet.

## Summoning Dogs as Steeds and Familars
The following rules can be used to add dogs as options for the *find familiar* spell and spells used to summon steeds. The dogs come with a set number of traits they can possess.

### Dog Familiars

When you use the *find familiar* spell, you can choose to have the familiar take the form of a **small dog** with one non-magical trait. 

### Dog Pact of the Chain Familiars

If you are a warlock with the Pact of the Chain feature, when you use the *find familiar* spell, you can choose to have the familiar take the form of a **magic dog familiar** with six traits that can be magical or non-magical.

## Example Dogs of Non-Human Races
The following creatures are examples of dog breeds that could be utilized by other common humanoid races. They can be used as they are or modified to better suit your adventure as you see fit.

### Dwarven Mine Dogs

These hounds are as stout and strong-willed as their dwarven masters. Despite their heavyset build, dwarven mine dogs are quite flexible and adept at squeezing through small crevices. These traits help them to fulfill their most common duty of clearing mine shafts of verminous pests hiding within small nooks and crannies. 

A mine dog’s second, and arguably most important, duty is to alert a dwarven mining crew of potential ambushes by other subterranean creatures. Their alertness and lightning-fast response time ensure dwarven crews are not caught off guard by such attacks, and mine dogs will always rush into the frey to protect their charges. In the most deadly attacks, mine dogs have been known to lay down their lives to ensure the survival of a dwarven crew. Such hounds are given a hero’s burial, and it is said they continue to protect and serve the dwarves’ ancestors in the afterlife

## Elven Hunting Hound

These prestigious hunting hounds are bred and kept by families of elven nobles who utilize their skills for sport and battle. Elven hunting hounds are most commonly found amongst wood elves, though members of high elven nobility often keep and breed packs of them. They possess an otherworldly grace akin to their elven masters, and they are bred almost as much for their beauty as their hunting skills.

Many elves claim the original hunting hounds were gifted to them by a grateful fey lord, while others believe they were once ordinary hounds who were slowly changed over time by the influence of the Feywild. Whatever the source of these gifts, they allow elven hunting hounds to pursue quarry through normally untrackable territory such as the confounding Feywild. It is said even the most elusive of fey can’t shake the trail of an elven hunting hound once it catches their scent.


Outside of hunting elusive beasts through magical wilds, elves also utilize their hunting hounds in defense of their territory. Elven lands are often enchanted in ways that hamper navigation through mundane means so as to confound intruders. Even expert navigators or dogs bred for tracking can quickly become confounded in such wilds. This makes them easy prey for elven hunting hounds leading patrol sentinels who quickly pick apart the would-be invaders.

## Gnomish Trinket Retriever

Gnomes are ever on the lookout for new curiosities and trinkets to experiment with. To this end, they’ve bred small magical retrievers capable of sniffing out otherwise hidden sources of magic. Known as trinket retrievers, these small rambunctious dogs are always eager to find new arcane scents. Gnomes will bring trinket retrievers with them when searching through scrap heaps to discover discarded objects that still possess magical properties. Despite their name, trinket hounds also find uses beyond finding arcane devices, such as sniffing out potential supernatural hazards in ancient ruins or detecting individuals under magical influences.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br>

Though for all their uses, trinket retrievers can prove to be quite hazardous companions. They possess a gnomish exuberance and carefree spirit that often gets them into trouble as they playfully seek out magical scents to experience. Unsupervised trinket retrievers can quickly run amuck in an arcane workshop, destroying fragile equipment and throwing experiments into disarray as they seek out their next magical toy.

## Halfling Riding Mastiff

Though halflings are generally not known for their wartime capabilities or battle savvy, when they must meet enemies in combat, they are known to ride into the fray upon mighty mastiffs. Though some of these steeds are essentially ordinary mastiffs trained to take a small rider, many halfling villages breed their own variants specially designed for mounted combat. These dogs are bred for solid frames capable of supporting riders and barding.

Even more importantly, they possess an instinctive ability to coordinate their combat efforts with their rider, whom they protect with their life.  Halfling riding mastiffs share the indomitable courage of their indomitable riders, and though they are big, slobbering, playful dogs in peacetime, in war, they are mighty steeds who see their riders through thick and thin. Many heroic stories and legends halflings tell involve a loyal mastiff steed that carried its owner onto glorious victories in the protection of their village.

# Angler Mimics
These bizarre monstrosities are a terrifying combination of shapeshifting mimics and deep-sea anglerfish. Though the only part of the angler mimic that can shapeshift is its lure, it can burrow to hide the rest of its massive body out of sight. The mimic then transforms its lure to appear as an object likely to attract attention. This object is commonly the form of a dead creature, but it could take a variety of appearances, such as a crate or chest. Once potential prey touches the lure, it becomes adhered to it, and the angler mimic reveals itself as it moves in for the kill.

In combat, the angler mimic can swing its lure into new victims to adhere them and prevent escape. The lure can even flash disorienting colors, making it difficult for victims to struggle free or even swim away. Once the angler mimic has prey ripe for devouring, it will open its mouth wide and create a massive vacuum, inhaling all creatures before it. The mimic is highly aggressive in its pursuit of fleeing prey and will charge creatures while inhaling, ensuring none escape its massive appetite.

>___
> ***Adhesive Lure***. The angler mimic’s lure adheres to anything that it touches. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the lure is also grappled by the angle mimic (escape DC 18 ). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
>
> ***Aquatic Burrowing.*** The angler mimic can only burrow underwater.
>
> ***Burrowed Ambusher.*** While the angler mimic is buried at least 5 feet underground, it has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and while it is no more than 20 feet underground, it has unobscured vision above the surface.
>
> ***Keen Sight.*** The angler mimic has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ***Shifting Lure.*** The angler mimic has a lure attached to its head which it can move anywhere within 30 feet of itself as an object interaction. It can polymorph the lure into a medium object which may shed dim light out to 20 feet as part of this object interaction. The lure can't be extended through a space too small to fit a medium object. The lure follows the relative position of the angler mimic as it moves. The lure immediately returns to the angler mimic's location if there is no opening at least 1 foot wide between its body and the lure. 
>
>For all practical purposes, the lure is the angler mimic, meaning that the angler mimic occupies its space and the lure's space simultaneously. However, the lure has its own AC of 16 and a HP pool of 200 hit points. The lure is destroyed if it is reduced to 0 hit points or if the angler mimic dies. If an effect targets only a single creature, any damage it deals is only dealt to the angler mimic or its lure (whichever was targeted.)
>
> ***Water Breathing.*** The angler mimic can breathe only underwater.
>
> ### Action
>
>  ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage.
>
> ***Lure Grab.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target within 5 feet of its lure. *Hit:* 11 (1d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
>
>  ***Vortex Vacuum.*** Until the start of the angler mimic's next turn, it sucks up the water in a 15-foot cone in front of it. During this time, the cone moves with the angler mimic, the angler mimic can't change the direction it's facing, and the angler mimic can only move forward in that direction. The cone is suppressed while the angler mimic is incapacitated.
> 
> The first time each turn the cone overlaps with a creature in the same body of water as the angler mimic, it must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled to the angler mimic. A creature pulled to the angler mimic takes 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage and is swallowed by the anglerfish if it is Huge or smaller and the angler mimic has room in its stomach. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the angler mimic, and takes 24 (7d6) acid damage at the start of each angler mimic's turns.
> 
> If the angler mimic takes 30 damage or more on a single turn, and none of it is dealt to its lure, it must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or end the effects of its cone and regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of it. The angler mimic can have up to 9 creatures swallowed at a time. Large creatures count as 4 creatures, and Huge creatures count as 9. If the angler mimic dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The angler mimic can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The angler mimic regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Check.** The angler mimic makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Redirect Vacuum.** The angler mimic changes the direction of its vortex vacuum.
>
> **Rush.** The angler mimic moves up to half its movement. During this movement, its speed can't be reduced, and it can't be knocked prone.
>
>  **Tenacious Will.** If the angler mimic is suffering an effect that requires it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage, ending the effect on a success. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Flashing Lure (Costs 2 Actions).** Each creature within the light of the angler mimic's lure must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of the angler mimic's next turn. While blinded this way, the creature moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws and checks.
>
> **Lure Swing (Costs 2 Actions).** The angler mimic moves its lure without provoking opportunity attacks. It can make a Lure Grab attack before or after this movement.

# Sea Fish: Part 1

## Barracuda
These fearsome creatures are among the most effective predatory fish in all the seas. The barracuda's long, stream-lined body can reach over 5 feet in length and is covered in silvery scales that make it difficult to spot in the water. Once it's gotten close enough to its prey without being spotted, it quickly closes the distance in a burst of speed. The barracuda's ambush tactics rarely give its targets the chance to react before being captured in its fanged jaws. Its barbed teeth make escape unlikely, and the trapped prey is quickly ripped apart.

***Aggressive Hunters.*** Barracuda are voracious predators and will hunt most other sea creatures their size or smaller. They rarely attack humanoids without provocation unless visibility is poor, and they mistake glittering jewelry for a fish. However, if an unnatural influence is disturbing their home waters, the barracuda's natural aggression can lead it to attack anything and everything in sight. It may indiscriminately slaughter every fish it sees and even attack larger creatures in its confused state until the corrupting influence is cleared. Some barracuda may become permanently warped by these influences, taking on a supernatural appearance and dedicating their every moment to mad ocean slaughter.

&emsp; ***Giant Barracuda.*** While most barracuda are a minor threat to humanoids, these massive fish are large enough to consider humanoids prey. Giant barracuda hunt using the same ambush tactics as their smaller kin and will often prey upon divers and aquatic humanoids. Those able to control sea creatures will often use giant barracuda as the marine equivalent of hunting dogs and call upon them to slay or retrieve creatures of interest attempting to flee underwater.

***Schools of Barracuda.*** While most barracuda become solitary hunters as they grow older, younger barracuda commonly form schools for protection and to more effectively hunt other schools of fish. These schools of barracuda generally ignore larger creatures unless subjected to unusual external influences, such as corrupted waters or the direct control of powerful druidic magic. Such schools can become highly aggressive and formidable foes, able to shred larger sea creatures and even groups of humanoids within a few bloody moments.

## Lionfish
These fish derive their name from their fearsome appearance and ferocious predatory behavior. Lionfish are voracious hunters and will devour nearly any creature smaller than themselves, even other lionfish. When approaching its prey, the lionfish launches a jet of water at the target, leaving it floundering. The lionfish then quickly closes on its disoriented prey, gulping it down in one bite. Their effectiveness as hunters often leads them to dominate whatever ecosystem they find themselves in, and fishermen often make a habit of focusing their hunts on lionfish in an effort to keep their population under control.

The fact that so few predators are willing to trifle with a lionfish also makes their numbers difficult to control. Their large, brightly colored fins warn of their venomous nature, and they back this threat up with their long poisonous spines. These spines make them hazardous prey for most creatures, and humanoids jabbed by a lionfish can be left sickened for an extended period, though the poison is rarely fatal.

***Giant Lionfish.*** Lionfish pose little threat to creatures larger than themselves, and so they are rarely of any concern to humanoids. Unless, of course, they find themselves facing a lionfish larger than themselves. Giant lionfish readily group most humanoids into the broad category of things to be preyed upon and hunt them the same way they hunt other fish. At their size, giant lionfish can deliver lethal skewering attacks with their spines, shoot jets of water large enough to leave most humanoids floundering, and swallow said humanoids whole. Masses of giant lionfish can wreak havoc on a marine ecosystem, devouring not only all the wildlife but also all the aquatic humanoids and fisherman who traverse those waters.

## Pufferfish
These small, slow, awkward-looking fish are <br> quite unassuming at first glance. Their <br> beak-like mounts allow them to feed on <br> hard-shelled mollusks, and they mostly keep <br> to themselves, using their keen sight to spot <br> and avoid predators. Should the pufferfish be <br> unable to avoid a confrontation, it will deploy <br> its unusual method of defense in which it <br> inflates itself, ballooning to several times its <br> normal size and projecting many needle-like <br> spins outwards. This defense alone often <br> prevents predators from closing their jaws <br> around the pufferfish. Should the tactic <br> succeed, the now spherical pufferfish can <br> slowly bob away to safety before deflating <br> back to its normal size.

While the pufferfish's unique and even <br> comical inflationary ability is its most iconic <br> trait, it is far from its only form of defense. <br> Many pufferfish contain potent neurotoxins, <br> which coat their skin and spines. A single <br> pufferfish can hold enough poison to kill 30 <br> adult humans, and contact with its spines can <br> be lethal. The poison can paralyze muscles and <br> slow the heart, and even those that survive may <br> be comatose for an extended time. Despite the <br> lethality of these fish, some consider them a <br> delicacy, and specially trained chefs will prepare <br> pufferfish in a way that (hopefully) doesn't kill patrons.

***Giant Pufferfish.*** All of the inherent dangers of an ordinary pufferfish are exponentially enhanced by its giant cousin. In their deflated state, they are already the size of most humanoids, and once they inflate, they can dwarf an ogre. A threatened giant pufferfish can quickly spell doom for any creatures that come too close and few sea creatures dare to hunt them.

Some cunning sea folk will keep giant pufferfish near their homes to ward off intruders. Particularly influential sea folk will even send them out to meet attacking warbands. Should the warriors be foolish enough to close in on the pufferfish, they will quickly be scattered and poisoned as it unleashes its explosive growth.

# Sea Fish: Part 2

## Anglerfish

Deep in the ocean's midnight depths, beyond the reach of any daylight, the sea life takes on a nightmarish aspect. No creature exemplifies this more than the anglerfish. Its demonic visage is made up of two beady black eyes sitting above a vast gaping maw filled with long, barbed teeth. Atop its bulbous body is its iconic lure, tipped with glowing light, which it uses to draw prey to itself in the otherwise lightless deep. 

***Sinister Beacon in the Dark.*** Luckily, ordinary anglerfish rarely reach more than a foot in length and are harmless to humanoid-sized creatures. They prey on sea creatures their size or smaller, using their light lure to attract these potential meals. The anglerfish appears as a beacon in the dark, with its shadowy form hidden from view. Once prey comes close enough, it opens its mouth wide, creating a powerful vacuum to pull in anything within range. After the victim is swallowed, the anglerfish's long interlocking teeth serve to bar any potential escape.

<br><br><br>

***Huge Appetites.*** Due to the scarcity of food in the deep, anglerfish move slowly to conserve energy and rarely pass up a meal. Even if the anglerfish has recently fed or the prospective meal is larger than them, it will make use of its ever-expanding gut to make room for the new meal. Anglerfish will gluttonously gulp down huge amounts of prey this way to provide nourishment over long periods of scarcity in the vast depths.

***Giant Anglerfish.*** While ordinary anglerfish are no threat to humanoids, their giant kin are a nightmarish danger to any who venture into the deep. They hunt larger creatures such as humanoids using the same tactics as ordinary anglerfish, and their lures can blind and disorient their prey, making escape even more difficult. These monstrous fish are one of the many reasons other sea-dwelling races fear venturing into the lightless depths, and many a would-be sea elf or triton explorer has met their end in the gullet of these abyssal horrors.

>___
> ***Abyssal Hunter.*** The anglerfish has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide while in darkness and is invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see it in darkness.
>
> ***Lure.*** The anglerfish has a lure attached to its head which it can extend up to 30 feet from itself as object interaction. The lure sheds dim light within a 20-foot radius. The lure follows the relative position of the anglerfish as it moves.
>
> ***Water Breathing.*** The anglerfish can breathe only underwater.
>
> ### Actions
>
>  ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage.
>
>  ***Vacuum Gulp*** The anglerfish sucks up the water in a 30-foot cone in front of it. Each creature in that area that is in the same body of water as the anglerfish must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled to the anglerfish. A creature pulled to the anglerfish takes 25 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage and is swallowed by the anglerfish if it is huge or smaller and the anglerfish has room in its stomach. A swallowed creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the anglerfish, and it takes 24 (7d6) acid damage at the start of each of the anglerfish's turns. 
>
>If the anglerfish takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the anglerfish must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the anglerfish. The anglerfish can have up to 9 creatures swallowed at a time. Large creatures count as 4 creatures, and huge creatures count as 9. If the angler fish dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.
>
> ### Bonus Action
>
> ***Flashing Lure (Recharge 5-6)*** Each creature within the light radius of the anglerfish's lure must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be blinded until the end of the anglerfish's next turn. While blinded this way, a creature moves at half speed and has disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws and ability checks.

## Sawfish

These bizarre fish are easily recognized by their massive sawtoothed nose extensions, which usually make up between one-quarter to one-third of the animal's total length. Sawtooth fish come in a range of different sizes depending on the species, but they all use their sawtoothed extensions in the same ways.

***Bizzare Weaponry.*** The most obvious use of the sawfish's massive toothed nose is as a weapon. Sawfish will slice through their prey with rapid slashing motions of their saw. This tactic can be used in the open water and on the ocean floor, where they use the saw to pin and manipulate their targets. While sawfish don't actively hunt anything too large to fit into their relatively small mouths, when threatened, they can use their saws to inflict massive damage on would-be attackers and can even fend off sharks this way. Should a sea druid or other powerful being gain control of several sawfish, they can be used as a powerful aquatic strike force, slashing at foes from a distance while staying out of striking range.

\columnbreak

&emsp; ***Electroreceptive Antenna.*** The second, more subtle use of the saw appendage is as an electroreceptive tool. This saw contains thousands of sensory organs allowing the sawfish to detect the electrical fields of nearby creatures, enabling them to spot prey hidden beneath the sea floor and in murky water. This tool makes them difficult to sneak up on, and sea folk able to control sawtooth fish will often use them to scan the sea floor for hidden creatures when hunting.

## Stargazer

These bizarre fish reach lengths between one to two feet and possess large bulging eyes and a perpetually frowning mouth filled with interlocking needle-like teeth. These features form a disturbing face that perpetually points upwards, hence their name. Stargazers are capable diggers and hide by burrowing into the sandy ocean floor until only their upward pointing face is flush with the surface. Here, they lie and wait until an unsuspecting creature comes within range. At that moment, the stargazer strikes in the space of a heartbeat. The prey is snagged before it can react and pulled into the stargazer's gullet via powerful suction.

***Vicious Defences.*** Stargazers possess an array of natural weapons that make them unpleasant to contend with even when their hiding spots have been exposed. They have fins tipped with venomous spines, which they can use to threaten creatures that attack them from different angles. But, most bizarrely of all, stargazers can unleash a powerful electrical shock capable of deterring most would-be predators.

***Giant Stargazers.*** These horrifyingly huge fish prey on any creature smaller than themselves that ventures too close to their hiding spot, including humanoids. To make matters worse, they possess all the vicious defenses of ordinary stargazers but at a much larger scale, giving them a multitude of methods for slaying any foolish swimmers that tangle with them. Someone traversing the sea floor may suddenly find themselves staring down at the creature's grizzly visage for a split second before being devoured in the blink of an eye, never to be heard from again.

## Stonefish

These fish derive their name from their penchant for camouflaging as rocks or coral on the sea floor, and they generally grow to just over two feet. Their camouflage can be quite elaborate, with a variety of colors and features that allow them to blend into their given environment. These environments tend to be reefs and rocky tide pools, and these disguises enable a stonefish to be nearly undetectable while it sits motionless on the sea floor. When prey draws close, it attacks at lightning speed, using suction to gulp down its meal almost instantaneously.  

***Deadliest of Fish.*** Stonefish hold the title of most venomous fish in the world. This venom is contained in dorsal spines hard enough to pierce the soul of a boot. 

Combine this with their excellent camouflage, and stonefish quickly become one of the creatures most hazardous to humanoids walking through shallow sea waters. If not treated quickly, wounds from this venom can prove fatal to those of weak constitution.

***Giant Stonefish.*** These fish disguise as large rocks and expanses of coral on the sea floor and prey on a huge range of creatures. Fishermen and divers are a favorite meal of the giant stonefish, and many such individuals may mysteriously go missing before people begin to suspect the presence of such a fish in nearby waters. Even those who initially survive their encounter with this monstrous creature may be inflicted with its horrific venom and later succumb to its agonizing effects.

A poisoned creature repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success or taking 21 (6d6) poison damage on a failure. If it fails the save by 10 or more, it is paralyzed until the end of its next turn.

## Swordfish

These strange yet elegant fish are easily recognized by their trademark noses which extend out like a long rapier. The aptly named swordfish is among the fastest swimmers in the world, and it combines this speed with tight maneuverability and its slashing bill to become one of the most effective hunters of the open ocean. The swordfish hunts other fish in open waters where there is nowhere to hide and no hope of outswimming such a high-speed attacker. Even swimming in schools does a fish little good, as the swordfish's slashing bill attacks allow it to cut through swaths of fish at a time.

***Fast Manuverable Combatants.*** Swordfish generally reach 10 feet in length, though the largest specimens can reach 15 feet. Their size, speed, and deadly weapon make them formidable foes, though they generally have little interest in fighting other large creatures unless threatened. Should a swordfish be influenced by external forces driving it to attack other creatures, it can utilize its speed and the reach of its sword to perform hit-and-run attacks against its targets. Its speed also makes it difficult to pin down and allows it to make devastating charging attacks. These attacks utilize rapid slashing motions of its sword bill that are difficult to predict and strike targets in unexpected ways.

&emsp; ***Great Swordfish.*** These massive specimens are either members of ordinary species of swordfish that reached record-breaking sizes or members of their own giant species. Their increased size naturally makes them more dangerous hunters capable of bringing down larger prey. Their increased size and amazing speed also make the great swordfish a prized mount sought after by aquatic races such as sea elves. A school of marine cavalry atop great swordfish can weave in and out of battle, charging down foes and fleeing from threats with equal efficiency, and many a valiant ocean knight relies on a trusty swordfish steed to see the day through.

# Primeval Fish

## Dunkleosteus

These massive, armored fish were among the first monstrous apex predators to roam the primeval oceans of the world. The dunkleosteus could reach between 20 to 30 feet in length and weigh over a ton. They possessed boney armor across the front of their body, and though they didn't have teeth in the traditional sense, their armor formed into a beak-like structure made of two razor-sharp boney plates. Combined with the massive bite force, these sheering jaws could cut through the armor of its equally boney prey with ease. 

Though their heavy armor made them slower swimmers than most modern sea creatures, their methods of suction feeding allowed them to draw in prey before delivering their devastating bite.

Though they are believed to be extinct, some dunkleosteus may still lurk in lost seas cut off from the march of time. Through powerful magic, others may be brought back to life to terrorize the oceans once more. Should a dunkleosteus be brought into the service of a druid or other powerful being, it can be utilized as a devastating nautical tank, able to shred through heavily armored foes and ships alike with its sundering jaws.

> ### Reactions
> ***Cranial Plating.*** When an attack without advantage that the dunkleosteus can see hits it, it can use its reaction to absorb the damage through its skull, halving any bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage the attack deals.

## Megalodon
These titanic beasts are not only the greatest of all sharks but among the largest predators to have ever lived. The megalodon reached lengths of 50 to 60 feet, weighed over 60 tons, and had the most powerful bite of any beast to have ever lived. Their primary prey were whales and other large sea creatures, which they could kill with a single bite. 

Though they are no longer commonplace, there are scattered reports that some megalodons still rule deep, remote ocean locals. Some even claim that megalodons occasionally venture into waters populated with humanoids where they terrorize sailors and local sea life alike. Others believe megalodons aren't a natural species of shark but divine punishment sent by wrathful sea gods to devour ocean-going mortals.

Regardless of a megalodon's origin, sahuagin always see its arrival as the coming of a divine avatar sent by their shark god. A sahuagin king will take charge of the mighty megalodon and use it to rally a conquering army. The presence of a megalodon inspires terror in enemies and near unbreakable ferocity in sahuagin warriors. Such a force can spell doom for entire undersea kingdoms and take control of a whole sea's worth of ship trade.

# Monstrous Sawfish
While ordinary sawfish can be dangerous when provoked, they rarely threaten humanoids and generally use their massive sawtoothed nose extension for hunting smaller fish. However, some sailors swear they've seen these creatures saw right through entire ships before devouring the helpless passengers. These sailors encountered no ordinary sea creature but a monstrous sawfish that specializes in cutting apart sea vessels and dismembering their crew.

***Ship Wrecker.*** When a monstrous sawfish attacks a ship, its highest priority is destroying enough portions of the vessel that it begins to sink. It can do this with terrifying efficiency, often sinking mighty vessels within seconds. The sawfish will only interrupt its ship destruction to attack other individuals actively posing a threat and reachable with its saw. Otherwise, the sawfish will wait until the ship is sinking before it begins preying on those aboard.

***Stuck Saws.*** When attacking particularly sturdy ship sections, the monstrous sawfish risks getting its saw stuck. While it can usually wrench itself free, it is left vulnerable while stuck this way, and brazen sailors may seize the opportunity to attack the sea monster while they can. However, those heedless of the danger it still poses may find themselves quickly dismembered as the sawfish pulls itself free and saws its attacker in half with one swift but brutal motion.

>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Arcing Swing.*** When the sawfish misses with its saw attack against a target creature or uses an action to break free of the restrained condition caused by a target object, it can immediately make a saw attack against a different target within 15 feet of the original target and within range of the attack.

&emsp;***Wrath of the Seas.*** Sailors debate the origin of these sea monsters. Many believe a vengeful ocean god created them to punish humanoids for possessing the hubris to think they could dominate the seas using puny marine vessels. Others believe they were bred by aquatic races resentful of the intrusion of land-dwellers in their domain. 

Whatever their origin, monstrous sawfish are often controlled by ocean deities and aquatic races who wish to unleash the wrath of the seas upon enemy ships. Once they are set upon by monstrous sawfish, whatever illusion of navel superiority the land-dwellers think they have is shattered as quickly as their ships. Should a full school of monstrous sawfish be brought to bear, it can spell doom for an entire fleet.

# Geese
Small, elegant, and unassuming, these waterfowl are a common sight at parks, ponds, and even small town squares. Geese congregate in large, migratory flocks and generally don't reach sizes much longer than 3 feet or weigh much more than 10 pounds. But, despite their small stature and lack of obvious natural weapons, these fearsome fowl are known to terrorize creatures many times their size.

***Terror of the Ponds.***  While geese lack the true combat abilities of many deadlier creatures, they are often able to make up for it through sheer stubborn confidence. A goose is not easily frightened and will even stand its ground against adversaries as menacing as rhinos.  

When they combine this stubbornness with a fearsome display of honking and flapping, geese can often send huge creatures running in fear. This can lead to geese taking over entire parks and driving townsfolk out of their own village squares.

***Goose Attacks.***  While geese don't possess the most deadly of natural weapons, a furious goose makes the most of what it has at its disposal. Small nips from their beaks are common and generally more annoying than anything else. But a goose unleashing a full assault combines bites with furious strikes from their wings and raking claws attacks to their target's face. Even if the onslaught does minor damage, it is often enough to break the resolve of the creature, sending the goose's victim fleeing in terror.

&emsp;***Gaggles of Geese.***  While an individual goose <br> is generally not dangerous, a group of geese, <br> known as a gaggle, can be a terrifying and <br> formidable threat. A gaggle that has identified <br> one or more creatures as an enemy will <br> relentlessly swarm its victims, bombarding <br> them with a never-ending slew of nips, wing <br> attacks, and claws to the face. A gaggle of <br> geese that has been driven to view all <br> humanoids as threats could easily conquer a <br> small park and terrorize a whole village, <br> sending all its residents fleeing to their homes <br> for safety from the fowl assault.

***Low Tier Druidic Guardians.***  Sometimes, a <br> druidic apprentice will be tasked with watching <br> over a minor natural feature, such as a pond, <br> park, or stream. Druids often receive aid from <br> local animals in carrying out their guardianship, <br> with more powerful druids able to call on the <br> aid of more powerful creatures. However, these <br> druids in training must rely on more modest <br> animals and often turn to geese to aid them in the <br> protection of their charges. These geese will fiercely <br> defend the druid and their charge, ruthlessly driving  <br>out intruders on sight.  

If there is a humanoid settlement nearby and the druid feels spiteful, malicious, or perhaps just bored, the geese may be sent to harass and attack the settlement's inhabitants. These incidents are more common than most will admit, and an embarrassing number of adventuring careers have been ended prematurely by malevolent gaggles of geese.

***Paragons of Halfling Bravery.*** Halflings feel a special kinship with geese. Both enjoy quiet pastoral lives and are small and unassuming. But both can also call upon their innate stubborn bravery to overcome seemingly impossible odds. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Halflings view geese in much the same way humans view lions, and they often incorporate goose iconography into icons associated with combat and courage.  Halflings encourage geese to stay in and around their villages, believing them to bring good luck. This belief is not entirely unfounded, as there are many tales of attacks on halfling villages being foiled by a sudden uprising of the local goose population.

## Giant Flightless Goose

Thought lost to the mists of time, these ancient <br> creatures are distant relatives to the modern goose <br> and can be found terrorizing the world's primeval <br> ponds and rivers. Standing 5 feet tall, these geese <br> lack the ability to fly but make up for it with their size <br> and fierce wing attacks. While they are thought to be <br> long extinct, travelers visiting remote rivers and time <br> lost islands may stumble across long-lost colonies of <br> these bizarre creatures.

***Flightless Pugilists.*** These geese have given up <br> the ability to fly, but in return, they've gained a more formidable size advantage and more devastating <br> natural weapons. Not only are their bites more <br> powerful, but their wings have transformed from a <br> means of flying into pure weapons intended for <br> delivering bone-breaking punches. Each wing ends <br> in a large bony knob, which the goose uses to deliver powerful strikes to rival geese, would-be predators, <br> and anyone else intruding on its territory. A united <br> gaggle of these beasts is usually more than enough <br> to send other creatures fleeing in terror, and those <br> who stand their ground will be subjected to an <br> unrelenting flurry of punches and bites.

***Amphibious Mounts.*** Some small, remote <br> woodland folk who live around sources of fresh <br> water will make use of giant geese as riding <br> animals. Though they lack the land speed of other <br> creatures,  their amphibious nature makes them <br> useful for quickly traversing various types of terrain. <br> Remote halfling villages, forest gnomes, and even <br> some fey will befriend these creatures, thereby  <br> gaining useful mounts and fierce guardians.  


Halflings, in particular, hold a special reverence <br> for these creatures, believing giant geese to be heroic <br> steeds sent by their gods to aid them in times of dire <br> need. There are many halfling folk tales which tell of <br> mighty heroes accomplishing great deeds upon their <br> brave and noble goose steed.

## Golden Goose

This enigmatic fey creature would appear to be a normal goose if not for the golden coloration radiating a faint magical glow, giving away its supernatural nature. These creatures can be wonderful gifts and companions to those who've won the favor of fey lords and the bane of those who would greedily attempt to snatch the goose for themselves.

**Selective Fey.**  Golden geese may be given as gifts by fey lords or simply choose companions of their own accord. In either case, if someone who hasn't earned the favor of the goose attempts to steal it, they may find the enchanted bird impossible to move. Worse yet, they may find themselves magically adhered to their would-be prize, helplessly dragged where ever to goose goes.  

**Prized Eggs.** The most prized attribute of the golden goose is its ability to lay magical golden eggs. Each of these eggs is made of enchanted gold and fetches a handsome price on the market. Most valuable are the supernatural eggs they can produce once per year. It is said that anyone who swallows one of these eggs will be cured of any aliment they are suffering from, supernatural or otherwise. As such, the retrieval of these eggs is often the focus of entire quests.

<br>

> ##### Golden Eggs
> The golden goose can lay a golden egg worth 100g once every 2d4+1 days. Once a year, the goose can lay a special egg which is a magic item worth 500g that can be consumed to cure one disease, poison or curse.

## Mischievous Goose
Though geese excel at disrupting the daily lives of humanoids, they are simple creatures.  Their disruptions are limited to chasing, honking, and sometimes attacking those who draw their ire.  But occasionally, a goose of extraordinary intelligence and guile will visit a village and bring with it a slew of mischievous disruptions, thefts, and sabotages.

**Random Acts of Mischief.** Though these geese have no official title, they all share a common aptitude for causing disruptions in the lives of others.  Their intelligence is far and above that of a typical goose, and they are known for their ability to sneak, steal, and escape from most humanoids with surprising ease.  Mischievous geese use these abilities to achieve a seemingly random variety of arbitrary tasks.  These tasks may involve something as simple as stealing and hoarding matching sets of items to elaborate tasks resulting in people injuring themselves in embarrassing ways, becoming trapped in buildings, or seeing their belonging destroyed.  These disruptions usually aren't dangerous, and the greatest injuries the goose's victims receive are to their pride.

**Agents of Chaos.**  Sometimes, a fey creature, druid, or even a god of trickery will develop a grudge against a particular village that they feel has wronged them.  As a petty means of enacting revenge, a mischievous goose will be summoned and unleashed upon the unsuspecting townsfolk, ruining all of their day plans.  Particularly unfortunate villages might be infiltrated by multiple mischievous geese, leaving the whole town in chaos.

# Hippos

Despite being herbivorous, the hippopotamus is one of the most dangerous river creatures in the animal kingdom.  Reaching over 15 feet in length and weighing up to 4,000 pounds, not even crocodiles will trifle with an adult hippo.  With their dense hide, huge size, and massive jaws, hippopotami are the undisputed rulers of the riverways.

***Aggressive Nature.***  The herbivorous nature of the hippopotamus in no way makes it docile or safe to approach.  Hippos are very aggressive and are likely to attack any creature that comes too close.  They will open their jaws wide in a threatening manner in an attempt to scare off intruders.  Should that fail, the unfortunate intruder will likely be charged and subjected to the hippo's devastating bite.

***Blood Sweat.*** Because hippos lack fur and live in very sunny environments, their skin is vulnerable to the sun's harsh rays.  Infections from contaminated river water are also a concern.  

To combat these threats, hippos secrete an oily substance from their skin, often referred to as "blood sweat."  This blood sweat protects them from the sun's rays and helps prevent infections common to rivers.

***River Runners.*** Though they are river creatures, hippos cannot swim.  Instead, they rely on their extremely dense bodies to allow them to run along the bottoms of rivers without impediment.  They have been known to chase down boats this way, leaping up through the water and chomping through the unfortunate water vehicle.

***Hippopotamus Gorgops.*** These monstrous creatures are primeval relatives of the modern hippopotamus.  Growing 15 feet long, 7 feet high, and weighing nearly 10,000 pounds, the hippopotamus gorgops is a river titan.  Adventurers exploring remote and uncharted rivers may suddenly find themselves staring into the yawning jaws of these terrifying behemoths.

***Pygmy Hippos.*** This smaller cousin to the common hippopotamus is quite elusive.  Pygmy hippos only reach <br> 6 feet in length, 3 feet in height, and weigh up to 600 <br> pounds.  This smaller size, combined with their reclusive <br> and solitary nature, makes them difficult to locate.  

Pygmy hippos are also much less common than other hippos, and  their group sizes are much smaller, though <br> local druids  and other forest folk will often befriend them.  Smaller forest dwellers, such as forest gnomes, will sometimes use pygmy hippos as mounts and beasts of burden, and are very protective of their hippopotamid <br> friends.

# Jaguars
These fearsome, bone-crushing <br> felines are the undisputed kings of <br> their many domains.  Reaching lengths <br> of 6 feet and weighing little more than 200 pounds, they are not the largest cats; but they can bring down animals much larger than themselves with their crushing bite.  They are ambush masters, and given the element of surprise, a single jaguar can hunt down a creature as large as an adult bull.  A jaguar that ambushes a group of travelers can easily crush the life out of the frailest member of their party and drag the fresh kill away before the rest of the group even has the chance to react.

***Sovereign of Many Domains.***  Most creatures are adapted for a specific type of terrain where they perform optimally.   Jaguars know no such limitations and are the apex predators of the many environments they can traverse.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

In their jungle homes, they will stalk the terrestrial undergrowth for tapirs, swim through rivers to hunt caiman, and climb through trees looking for their next, unfortunate meal.  They are even comfortable leaving the jungle for open terrain, where they will hunt large cattle with impunity.  A wandering jaguar can quickly become the bane of a humanoid settlement, stalking its livestock and terrorizing its inhabitants.

&nbsp;  ***Bone Crushers.***  While tigers are the largest felines, the jaguar possesses the greatest bite force for its size and can shatter dense bone.  Whereas most cats attack the neck to crush the throat and asphyxiate their prey, jaguars simply bite through the spinal column or even the skull of their victims.  Very little can withstand the crushing bite of a jaguar, and they can even shatter large turtle shells within their jaws.      

***Giant Jaguars.***  These primeval beasts are the larger ancestors of modern jaguars.  Adapted to hunting megafauna, giant jaguars stalk environments where their large prey is plentiful.  They count even the largest and most fearsome of beasts as their prey, and most humanoids they find are little more than helpless snacks.

***Sacred Predators.*** Cultures that develop in or near the jaguar's domain often come to revere and associate them with one or more of their gods.  Druids and other powerful beings living near jaguars will also call upon them as powerful guardians.  In both cases, should intruders offend the local deities or druids, jaguars, or even giant jaguars, may be called to meet out divine punishment to the offenders.

## Kallikantzaroi
These diminutive fey look like black-furred goblinoids and sport beady red eyes, twisted horns, and small but sharp tusks. The appearance of a kallikantzaros might even be described as comical if not for the menacing wood-cutting hatchets they are almost never seen without. Most kallikantzaroi spend the majority of the year hibernating within the Feywild, seldom waking unless disturbed. When the winter solstice draws near, they rouse from their slumber and seek fey crossings into the Material Plane, where they can spread havoc. 

***Lost Goblinoid Kin.***  It is believed that kallikantzaroi were once goblins attempting to escape the wrath of their tyrannical gods by fleeing into the Feywild where they burrowed deep underground. Once there, they began feeding on the roots of powerful enchanted trees, which slowly turned them into the fey creatures they are known as today. 

If true, this would explain the kallikantzaroi's affinity for woodworking and digging hidden homes amongst forest groves. During most of the year, they chop away at magical tree roots around their home and sustain themselves on the enchanted tree sap they harvest. They've also developed a knack for evading detection by druids and other fey that view them as destructive pests.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***Winter Revelry.*** On the days near the Winter Solstice, kallikantzaroi will spring from the ground and find crossing into the Material Plane to go on their celebratory rampages. They have a taste for sweets, devouring them on sight and chopping apart anything that stands between them and a newly discovered treat. Sweetmeats are among their favorite meals, but they will also chop down trees to get at the sweet sap they prize, with the sap of evergreens being especially delicious to a kallikantzaros. 

Their attraction to sweets and evergreens inevitably draws kallikantzaroi to winter festivals, where they find an abundance of treats and holiday trees to feed on and chop apart. They make no attempt to bargain with the humanoids of these festivals, and as soon as they see an opportunity, kallikantzaroi will take and destroy all they can without ever being satiated. The kallikantzaroi will not leave until they’ve devoured every sweet and destroyed every tree unless driven out by force or the Winter Solstice comes to a close. Once the solstice comes to a close, the kallikantzaroi retreat to the Feywild for another year.

&emsp;***Drop Attackers.*** Kallikantzaroi love dropping out of trees and from rooftops onto their enemies whom they attach to, essentially forcing their victim to give them a piggyback ride. Once a kallikantzaros lands on its target’s back, it will mercilessly start lashing its victim with its axe. Many have fallen victim to these attacks while attempting to stop marauding kallikantzaroi from destroying festive trees or stealing from food shops. Kallikantzaroi will also drop onto unsuspecting targets cooking sweet foods such as ham or baked treats and lash the cook into submission before stealing their goods.

Kallikantzaroi rarely seek to lethally wound humanoids unless they are in a life-or-death fight and will usually only injure their victims as much as is necessary to prevent them from interfering with their revelry. Hacking apart objects and creatures that aren’t made of wood and devouring anything that isn’t sweet brings a kallikantzaros little joy.


***Kallikantzaros Foreman.*** Most kallikantzaros groups are led by at least one foreman. These kallikantzaroi fill the same role as goblin bosses, bullying other kallikantzaroi and keeping them in line. Most kallikantzaroi prefer to pilfer and destroy when others aren’t looking and will flee from formidable opponents, but the presence of a foreman can embolden them to become more aggressive in their tactics. Kallikantzaroi will fight more aggressively with a foreman leading them, and those who attempt to flee are caught and literally thrown back into the fray by their unforgiving boss.

# Mishipeshu
The mishipeshu lurks in the great lakes and rivers of the world, stalking through deep waters and shoreline brush. It is a fiendish creature shaped through druidic magic and has the body of a wildcat but with hard fish-like scales in place of fur. It sports two large antlers that it uses to ram its prey and a large razor fin that runs down its back and ends in a serpentine tail sharp enough to slice through steel. Though mishipeshu protect the sanctity of freshwater environments, they do so with a malevolence rivaling any fiend of the lower planes.

***Druidic Asylum.*** Fiends who have thoroughly displeased their masters will sometimes flee to remote locations of the material plane in an attempt to escape their punishment. These desperate cravens will often offer their services to powerful groups or individuals in exchange for protection, and sometimes they will even seek the protection of druidic circles. Most druidic circles will have nothing to do with fiends. However, if the druids are desperate enough, or they already have a disposition towards consorting with the darker forces of nature, they may come to an arrangement with the fiend.  

If the druids are in need of a guardian for a body of fresh water, they will perform a dark, ritualistic transformation on the fiend. This ritual requires water from the River Styx and a bastardized version of the reincarnation spell cast upon the fiend while it is submerged in the waters it is being charged with protecting. This dark baptism results in the fiend being reborn as a mishipeshu bound to the druids who performed the ritual along with the body of water it is charged with protecting.

***Cruel Guardians.*** Though a mishipeshu will faithfully protect its waters and reliably destroy any would-be defilers, its fiendish nature is reflected in the cruelty and malice with which it carries out its duty. A mishipeshu will use any excuse to meet out lethal punishment to intruders. A single fish taken without permission or the accidental spilling of even a drop of harmful substance into its waters will result in the mishipeshu ruthlessly butchering the offenders and anyone with them. Only high-ranking druids or other powerful beings of the natural world can call off a mishipeshu once an intruder is deemed guilty.

***Lingering Greed.*** The fiendish origin of the mishipeshu's former life leaves it with the selfish need to accumulate wealth, despite having no practical use for it. The mishipeshu will rob the corpses of its victims and anyone else who dies within its domain.  

Copper is its favorite material, and it often abhors other metals such as silver or cold iron, depending on the nature of its fiendish origin. It is said that mishipeshu can be placated with large amounts of copper, allowing travelers to pay penance for wrongs committed and buy safe passage through a protected waterway. However, no amount of copper can convince a mishipeshu to turn against the druid conclave it is bound to.

***Reborn in Water.*** A vital factor in a druidic conclave gaining the mishipeshu's loyalty is the promise that if it is destroyed, the mishipeshu can be reborn within the waters of its home. A mishipeshu who has died within the past 10 days can be revived by a druid casting the *reincarnation* spell on a gallon of water from the lake or river in which it was created. If the lake or river it was bound to is defiled or destroyed, the mishipeshu cannot be revived.

***Elder Mishipeshu.*** If a greater fiend undergoes the mishipeshu ritual of transformation, or a mishipeshu earns the blessing of its druidic conclave through generations of service, the result is an elder mishipeshu.  On rare occasions, elder mishipeshu even become the leaders of their druidic conclaves.  These mishipeshu have greater control over their murderous impulses, though their fiendish malevolence remains ever-present. 

<br><br>

Regardless of how these mishipeshu are created, their physical prowess are superior to those of their lesser kin, and they gain the ability to conjure violent storms to aid them in their hunts.  These storms provide cover while stalking prey and can be used to separate groups of trespassers so the mishipeshu can more easily pick off vulnerable targets.

## Mishipeshu River Lord
These mighty fiends are elder mishipeshu who've honed their druidic powers to the point where they've become the undisputed masters of their domain, usually ruling any druidic circles in the area. In addition to being more physically deadly in combat, these mishipeshu can bend their watery environment to their will.   

Mishipeshu river lords make their homes within underwater caves at the bottoms of lakes or rivers. Their layers are usually fully submerged in water or situated in steep rocky environments, making traversal by intruders difficult, if not deadly. Their central chambers are typically littered with the remains and treasures of former intruders. 

The druidic mastery of these mishipeshu allow them to turn their lairs against intruders, and if they believe their lands are being trespassed upon, they can unleash wild storms across their realm to batter their enemies.

#### Lair Actions
When fighting inside its lair, a mishipeshu river lord can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the mishipeshu can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* Pools of water within 90 feet of the mishipeshu surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. 
 
* The storm described by the mishipeshu's Storm Call ability is summoned at a point within the lair. The mishipeshu doesn't need to concentrate on the effect, which ends on initiative count 20 of the next round.

\columnbreak

* Freezing rain falls all across the lair. Each creature in the lair other than the mishipeshu must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn and lose concentration on any spells or effects it is maintaining concentration on.

#### Regional Effects

The mishipeshu's watery domain is transformed by is control of the elements and might include one or more of the following magical effects: 

* While in its layer, the mishipeshu can cast *control weather* without material components.

* Spells such as *control weather* or similar effects can't change the weather within 5 miles of its layer unless the mishipeshu allows it. 

* As an action, the mishipeshu can cause its reflection in a body of water within its layer to split off from itself. Once split, the reflection can travel up to 5 miles away from the layer but can't leave the water. The image remains split until the mishipeshu chooses to recall it or until it uses this feature again. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and moves like the mishipeshu. The mishipeshu can sense, speak, and use its telepathy from the image's location as if present at that location. If the image takes any damage, it disappears and is recalled back to the mishipeshu.

## Mummy Lord
In the tombs of the ancients, tyrannical monarchs and the high priests of dark gods lie in dreamless rest, waiting for the time when they might reclaim their thrones and reforge their ancient empires. The regalia of their terrible rule still adorns their linen-wrapped bodies, their moldering robes stitched with evil symbols and bronze armor etched with devices of dynasties that fell a thousand years before.

The most powerful of death priests can increase the potency of the rituals used to create mummies, thus allowing the creation of a terrible and extremely difficult-to-destroy mummy lord. The mummy lords created through such rituals retain their former memory and personality, with their ambitions undampened by the ages.  Not only do mummy lords wield the magical abilities they had in life, but their enhanced undead state grants them deadly necromantic powers and control over the sands of their homeland. Few can stand against these deathless monarchs without being immediately withered away dust by their terrible power.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
***Heart of the Mummy Lord.*** As part of the ritual that creates a mummy lord, the creature's organs are removed from the corpse and placed in canopic jars. The most vital of these organs is its shriveled heart; for as long as it remains intact, the mummy lord can't be destroyed permanently. Instead, if the mummy lord is reduced to 0 hit points, it turns to dust and re-forms at full strength 24 hours later near the canopic jar containing its heart. A mummy lord can be destroyed or prevented from re-forming by burning its heart to ashes. Because of this, the mummy lord usually keeps its heart in a hidden location such as a tomb or vault.

The mummy lord's heart has AC 5, 25 hit points, and immunity to all damage except fire.

### A Mummy Lord’s Lair
A mummy lord watches over an ancient temple or tomb that is protected by lesser undead and rigged with traps. Hidden in this temple is the sarcophagus where a mummy lord keeps its greatest treasures.

A mummy lord encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 16 (15,000 XP).
#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the mummy lord can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; it can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

* The mummy lord casts the *wall of sand* spell, targeting any area in its lair. The mummy lord doesn’t need to see the area and doesn’t need to concentrate on the spell, which ends on initiative count 20 of the next round. The wall doesn’t obstruct the mummy lord’s sight, and the mummy lord does not need to spend extra movement when moving through it.

* A **swarm of beetles** erupts from the ground at any point within the layer. The swarm acts on initiative count 20 just after the layer action. It has immunity to damage caused by the mummy lord’s spells and uses the mummy lord’s spell attack modifier for its attacks. The mummy lord can have up to three swarms summoned by this ability at a time.

* Until initiative count 20 on the next round, any non-undead creature that tries to cast a spell of first level or higher in the mummy lord’s lair is wracked with pain. The creature can choose another action, but if it tries to cast the spell, it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted.

\columnbreak

#### Regional Effects 

A mummy lord’s temple or tomb is warped in any of the following ways by the creature’s dark presence:

* Food instantly molders and water instantly evaporates when brought into the lair. Other nonmagical drinks are spoiled — wine turning to vinegar, for instance.

* Divination spells cast within the lair by creatures other than the mummy lord have a 25 percent chance to provide misleading results, as determined by the DM. If a divination spell already has a chance to fail or become unreliable when cast multiple times, that chance increases by 25 percent.

* A creature that takes treasure from the lair is cursed until the treasure is returned. The cursed target has disadvantage on all saving throws. The curse lasts until removed by a *remove curse* spell or other magic.

If the mummy lord is destroyed, these regional effects end immediately.


### Mummy Lord Adventures
The following table provides some ways to introduce mummy lords into your games:


##### Mummy Lord Adventure Hooks

| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The terrified tomb raider tasks the players with returning a rare artifact back to the ruin it was taken from and refuses to elaborate further. If the players take the artifact, they will be relentlessly hunted by a mummy lord until the treasure is returned to its home.|
|  2  | The aged high priestess of a mortuary cult has undergone a transformation into a mummy lord rather than pass on her mantle and now seeks to expand her power.|
|  3  | A vengeful mummy lord has risen and now hunts the descendants of those who brought about his original downfall.   |
|  4  |  While traveling through a seemingly empty desert, the players find a dying knight who only manages to tell them "It has awakened. . . " before crumbling to dust. |
|  5  | The players are overpaid with fabulous treasures by a normally greedy patron for their latest adventure. They soon learn the treasures carry a curse that draws the ire of a mummy lord. |
|  6  |  An ancient kingdom that was quickly decaying into obscurity suddenly begins rising to power when its original founder rises as a mummy lord and begins a campaign of conquest to restore the kingdom to its former glory. |

> ***Rejuvenation.*** A destroyed mummy lord gains a new body in 24 hours if its heart is intact, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the mummy lord's heart.
>
> ***Vengeful Word (1/day).*** At the end of the mummy lord's turn, if it has less than half its hit points, it can choose to start concentrating on a dark ritual (as if concentrating on a spell) until the end of its next turn. On its next turn, if the mummy lord is still maintaining concentration on the ritual, it can end the ritual as an action and utter a vengeful word. Each non-undead creature within 120 feet of the mummy lord that can hear the magical utterance must succeed on a DC 17 Charisma saving throw or take 49 (14d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also stunned until the end of its next turn.
>
> ### Actions
>

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with mummy rot. The cursed target can't regain hit points, and its hit point maximum decreases by 10 (3d6) for every 24 hours that elapse. If the curse reduces the target's hit point maximum to 0, the target dies, and its body turns to dust. The curse lasts until removed by the remove curse spell or other magic.
>
> ***Dreadful Glare.*** The mummy lord targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. If the target can see the mummy lord, it must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or become frightened until the end of the mummy's next turn. If the target fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it is also paralyzed for the same duration. A target that succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Dreadful Glare of all mummies and mummy lords for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The mummy lord casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Wisdom as its spellcasting ability spell (spell save DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks):
>
> 3/Day: *command* (3rd-level version), *dispel magic*, *silence*, *wall of sand* 
>
> 2/Day: *blight*, *divination*, *guardian of faith*

>**Reconstitute (Costs 3 Actions).** If the warlock is suffering from one or more conditions that require it to make a saving throw to end, it may immediately make a save against each condition. A successful save for any of the throws will end the condition immediately. The only saving throws that this action can be used for are saves that are made at the end or start of its next turn or saves that would use its action. The warlock can use this legendary action while incapacitated.

# Otters

These semi-aquatic creatures are known for their playful antics and slippery agility.  With their thick, waterproof coats and ability to hold their breath for long periods, otters are well suited to spending their days in the water and deep diving for food. The otter's small, cute appearance belies its formidable hunting and foraging prowess.  Though otters usually don't threaten humanoids, their speed, intelligence, and powerful bite make them more dangerous than they would appear.  With their keen eyesight and aquatic agility, otters are deadly hunters, and, in some cases, even the apex predators.   

## River Otters

The majority of otters are fresh water dwellers.  Equipped with long, slick bodies and powerful tails, river otters can be as small as 2 feet long and 2 pounds in weight to as large as 6 feet long and 100 pounds in weight.  Though they are generally not aggressive towards humanoids, they can be ferocious if provoked or if they view someone, as prey.

***Pack Hunters.*** Although river otters can hunt for small creatures on their own, many coordinate their attacks in pairs or larger groups.  This often involves cooperative fishing efforts, as otters work together to direct fish towards their pack mates.  Sometimes their pack hunting is used to bring down larger creatures that would otherwise be beyond the capabilities of a single river otter.   

***Giant River Otters.***   While most river otters are too small to threaten humanoid-sized creatures, some reach much greater sizes and can hunt larger prey.  The largest of these river otters are the aptly named giant river otters.  While they are not formidable individually, their pack hunting abilities make them apex predators of their environment.  When pack hunting, giant river otters can even bring down fearsome creatures such as caimans and anacondas.

Wolf otters make effective patrol and hunting animals when working with druids or other powerful beings of nature who live near remote riverways.  A pack of aggressive wolf otters can easily spell doom for a group of inexperienced explorers trespassing through their territory.

## Sea Otters

By far the most divergent of all otters, these creatures have adapted to living their lives almost entirely at sea.  Unlike most otters, sea otters are adapted to living in saltwater environments near coastlines.  They can reach lengths of nearly 5 feet and weigh up to 100 pounds, but they lack the long powerful tails of other otters.  Despite their relatively large size and powerful bite, sea otters generally don't pose a threat to humanoids and other larger creatures unless severely provoked.

***Awkward Walkers.*** Sea otters have adapted to spending nearly all of their lives at sea and don't move nearly as well over land as other otters.  Rather than coming ashore to rest, sea otters spend their days floating on their backs.  When they need to sleep, they will link arms with other sea otters to avoid drifting out to sea.

***Tool Users.*** Sea otters don't hunt in aggressive packs for fast-moving targets like other otters.  Clams, crustaceans, and other sea-dwelling invertebrates make up the majority of their diet.  To penetrate the tough shells many of these creatures possess, sea otters learn how to use stones to bash through the hardened defenses of their prey.  Sea otters can often be seen resting on their back at the ocean surface, with their latest catch perched on their stomach, bashing away at the soon-to-be meal.

> ##### Otters as Familiars
> **River otters** and **sea otters** may be used as familiar options when casting the *find familiar* spell. If a **sea otter** is used this way, it may still use its Rock attack option against objects.

## Thieving Otter
These strange and often infuriating creatures look similar to ordinary otters, but the evidence of their fey origin is evident at a glance.  They are often exotic shades of blue, pink, or purple and usually sport additional flair such as fins or feathery mohawks.  There is also an unmistakable, mischievous intelligence gleaming in their eyes.  Thieving otters earn their namesake from their notorious penchant for robbing other creatures blind, and they possess several magical abilities that allow them to do so with ease.  

***Rift Walkers.***  Not only do thieving otters possess the seemingly supernatural ability to avoid being grabbed or restrained, but they are also able to create small, short-range rifts that allow them to quickly teleport between locations.  

This teleportation allows them to appear seemingly out of nowhere, grab their desired items, and disappear before anyone can respond.  Only other otters can traverse these rifts, and an entire pack of otters can travel in and out of a rift in the blink of an eye, allowing them to go on high-speed raids. 

***Fey Thieves For Hire.*** Thieving otters form packs that roam rivers running through the Feywild and near fey crossings while looking for their next big score.  Though their behavior appears chaotic and impulsive, they often act on behalf of equally chaotic and impulsive fey lords.  Some thieving otter packs act as the Feywild equivalent of thief's guilds, working as burglars for hire on behalf of other powerful and affluent fey nobles.  Travelers are their favorite targets, but a wily adventurer with something to offer may be able to bargain with or even hire a pack of thieving otters.

> ***Amphibious.*** The otter can breathe air and water.
>
>***Escape Artist.*** The otter can use 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature grappling it. It can also spend 5 feet of movement when it is prone to stand up, rather than half its speed.
>
> ***Keen Sight.*** The otter has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ***Pack Tactics.*** The otter has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the otter's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
>
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d4 + 5) piercing damage.  If it hits a creature, the otter may make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check from the target creature.  If the creature fails the check, the otter may steal a small object of its choice that the target is holding or carrying on its person.
>
> ***Aquatic Rift (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The otter creates an invisible and immobile rift at an unoccupied point it can see within 5 feet of it that is submerged in water. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 60 feet of it that the otter can see or specify by distance and direction (such as "60 feet straight up"). While next to the rift, the otter can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the otter puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only otters can use the rift, and it lasts for 10 minutes, or until part of the rift is no longer submerged in water. 
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Cunning Thief.*** The otter can take a Disengage action, Hide action, Use An Object action, or make a Dexterity (Slight of Hand) check.

# Owls
These nocturnal birds of prey are often seen <br> as symbols of wisdom and the ever-present perceptiveness of the wilds.  Though, among some cultures, they are instead viewed as cursed omens of death and misfortune.  Owls can be found swooping across snowy tundras or perched ominously on dead tree branches deep within dark forests, their everpresent hooting echoing through the night.   By day, they are beautiful and sometimes even adorable hunting birds.  But by night, their glowing eyes strike fear into the hearts of travelers, reminding them the wilds are always watching.

***Stealthy Hunters.*** Most owls are less than two feet in length and have wingspans ranging from 1 to 6 feet across.  As such, their primary prey tends to be small rodents and rabbits.  Owls spot their quarry in the dead of night using superior dark vision and hearing.  Their nocturnal prey often relies on hearing to detect predators.  To counter this, owls have developed specialized feathers which allow them to fly slowly and stealthily, catching their unsuspecting meal by surprise.

***Wizarding Familiars.*** The stealth and keen senses of the owl make it a popular familiar amongst magic users.  Its associations with wisdom further its appeal amongst those with scholarly inclinations.  Wizarding schools often make extensive use of owls in their symbology and as familiars used for information gathering and parcel delivery.  Amongst magic users with a more sinister bent, owls can also serve as menacing familiars to spy on enemies and inspire fear and paranoia amongst superstitious commoners.

> ##### Waterlogged Owls
> Unlike most other birds of prey, owls do not possess a waterproof undercoat.  While short periods in the rain won't hinder them, if they become soaked in water, their fluffy feathers will absorb so much of it that they become too heavy and waterlogged to fly.  Owls in this state are extremely vulnerable and must dry out before they can fly again.  If you wish to incorporate this in your games, you can include a rule that owls soaked in water lose their fly speed until they dry off.

&emsp;***Great Horned Owls.*** The great horned owl is among the most far-ranging and dangerous of all its kind. These deadly birds of prey can measure over two feet in length and sport five-foot wingspans. Their talons can deliver crushing forces ten times what a typical human can produce, allowing them to kill most small prey instantly. This hunting prowess allows great horned owls to hunt a wide range of prey with impunity, and some have even been reported hunting animals as large and dangerous as foxes and bobcats.

***Giant Owls.*** In some extremely wild and dangerous areas, man-sized owls hunt much larger prey than their mundane counterparts.  These beasts are favored guardians and companions to many woodland races, and smaller peoples, such as forest gnomes, will even use them as flying steeds.  When giant owls contact traveling humanoids, they will not hesitate to hunt them like any other animal.  Villagers living near giant owl territory rarely travel alone or unarmed and always keep an eye to the treeline. 

***Monstrous Owls.***  Some owls obtain supernatural levels of size and intelligence.  They may be part of a larger species of monstrous owls or may have once been typical owls that were transformed through magical means.  In either case, their enhanced abilities make them deadly foes and powerful allies.  These owls will often align themselves with other fey and intelligent woodland beings.  Some are noble guardians, working with druidic circles to watch over and safeguard the wilds.  Others are brutal killers, serving dark fey as spies and assassins while mercilessly hunting down any who trespass upon their wilds.

## Owlbears
These beasts are monstrous amalgamations of giant owls and grizzly bears.  Owlbears possess the stealthiness and deadly beak of a giant owl, the sheer size, power, and aggression of a grizzly bear, and the heightened senses of both.  They are fiercely territorial hunters and will attack almost anything that crosses their path without provocation.  However, through tremendous effort, some races can train owlbears as fierce guardians and terrifying battle mounts.

***Snowy Owlbears.*** This subspecies of owlbear is native <br> to arctic environments and appears  to be a combination of snowy owl and polar bear.  It behaves much like other owlbears, but its polar bear nature makes it somewhat larger and much heartier than its temperate cousins.  The harshness of its environment also makes it a deadlier and more determined hunter.  Snowy owlbears are unrelenting in their pursuit of prey, willing to climb treacherous mountains and swim through icy waters to secure their kills.

## Strix
All the omens and superstitions regarding owls are made manifest in the dreaded strix.  These fiends are quite literally living curses shaped into the form of a dread owl with glowing malevolent eyes and wings that move in an almost incorporeal and dreamlike fashion.  This leads some to believe they are creations of dark magic, used by wicked spell casters to hunt their victims.  Others believe them to be fiends native to the underworld sent to reap the souls of the damned.  Regardless of their origin or motivation, once a strix has marked someone for death, there is little hope of escaping its terrible curse.  

***The Dread Curse.*** Strixes are cursed omens of death given physical form, and they seek to spread their curse to others.  When a strix marks someone for death, it will stalk its victim, sometimes for nights on end.  This stalking involves waking up the victims with terrifying calls in the night and watching them through darkened windows with shining eyes.  When their prey's mounting dread reaches its peak, the strix will strike, its talons imparting a fatal curse.  The doomed individual then has twenty-four hours to live before their soul is violently ripped from their body by the curse.  The only way to break to curse is to hunt down the strix and nail it to a wooden door, dead or alive, using an iron nail.

***Servants of Dark Powers.*** Strixes often act in the service of dark masters.  Hags and witches may summon a strix to enact vengeance upon someone who has crossed them, underworld fiends may send strixes to collect souls they've won through dark dealings, and dark wizards may summon strixes to use as twisted familiars.  Regardless of its master or mission, the strix will act with a single-minded malevolent determination to carry out its dark purpose.

The creature is aware of the curse and its effects.  The curse can be removed by nailing the strix to a wooden door, dead or alive, with an iron nail.  The curse also ends if the strix curses another creature with its talons.

# Rats 
These verminous rodents <br> are the most well-known <br> and infamous of their kind. <br> Though rats are not inherently <br> evil and can even be kept as pets, <br> they are strongly associated with disease <br> and ruin.  In urban environments, they are notorious for spreading plagues and devouring food stores.  Cities that fail to keep the rat population in check will soon be overwhelmed with rats scurrying through sewers and even out onto the open streets.  In these situations, rats can go from being common pests to harbingers of civilization-ending ruin.  

***Familiars and Test Subjects.*** 
Rats are common familiars for spellcasters, particularly among fiends and fey who enjoy utilizing them as scouts, spies, or agents to spread deadly epidemics.  Other, less fortunate rats are used as subjects for magical experimentation.  They may be used to test recently developed elixirs or to study the effects of new and experimental magic on living organisms.  Most test rats suffer bizarre and terrible deaths, the lucky ones receive extraordinary boons, and a rare few are warped into dark abominations threatening the sanctity of the natural world itself.

***Strength in Numbers.***
Rats are not known for their strength or ferocity, and individually they pose little threat.  Under most circumstances, threatened rats will quickly become frightened and scurry away from danger into the safety of small nooks and crannies.  Rats are more likely to become emboldened when working in large numbers, and a hungry group of rats may become desperate enough to attack larger creatures who appear vulnerable.  When they attack en mass this way, rats can quickly overwhelm their prey, allowing them to tear apart and devour creatures many times their size.

This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

&ensp;***Rats of Unusual Size.*** Occasionally, rats can reach sizes far beyond that of a typical specimen.  These rodents may belong to different species or the result of magical mutations, but the end result is the same.  Their increased size leads to boldness in the face of humanoids and other larger creatures, whom they are more likely to see as food than their smaller kin.  Though they still possess the same cowardice as normal rats, these larger rodents are much more likely to be aggressive towards humanoids.

These enormous rodents can be found stalking caverns, lurking in abandoned buildings, or scurrying deep through city sewers.  They may also be found in the service of hags or subterranean races such as kobolds or goblins.  The most common variety is the giant rat, which can reach the size of coyotes.  However, some monstrous rats are the size of timber wolfs and can easily hunt prey their size and larger, allowing them to serve as disturbing war beasts for unsavory masters.

&ensp; ***Vermin Tide.*** Rats operate most effectively in large numbers.  Nothing demonstrates this more clearly than the formation of a rat swarm.  This congregation of rodents behaves as a single entity, allowing many individually weak rats to suddenly become a serious threat.  Rat swarms may occur naturally if enough rats gather in one concentrated space, or they may result from magical manipulation.  Druids or witches may exert their influence over colonies of rats, whipping them into frenzied swarms to overwhelm their enemies.

If enough rats come together, they may form a dreaded rat tide.  These massive swarms can overwhelm groups of armed soldiers and strip them to the bone in moments.  They may arise in cities overrun with hungry rats, or they might be summoned by powerful dark magic, or they could be unleashed as a form of divine wrath upon a doomed town.  

***Rat Queens.*** Some especially vile rat infestations originate from a dark and unnatural source.  Rats of these infestations behave like eusocial creatures, and at their center is a monstrous rat queen, spawning endless waves of vermin.  These disturbing matriarchs are the size of hippos and barely mobile.  They depend on the protection of their swarm and are capable of rallying their normally cowardly offspring, who will give their life for their queen.  
The origin of these rat queens is unknown, with some theorizing them to result of twisted magical experiments and others believing them to be the creations of some forgotten rat diety.  Whatever the case, the presence of a rat queen quickly spells doom for any unfortunate population near its nest.  The rat queen will often nest in a large abandoned building or sewer system where its swarms will spread forth to bring ruin upon civilization.

# Monstrous Rats
The following creatures have forms and traits associated with rats found in nature, but nothing is natural about any of these monstrosities.  They may  have once been wild creatures twisted into abominations, or they may have entirely magical origins.  They may be isolated cases of monstrous rats or associated with a larger force of rat-like creatures.  In any case,  they are certain to terrorize any would-be adventures unfortunate enough to cross their path.

## Brood Horrors
These monstrous rodents are thought to have once been giant rats subjected to twisted, mutating forces shortly after birth.  Their mutations grant them regenerative powers and rapid growth, which drives a ravenous hunger, leading the brood horror to devour all its litter mates and quickly grow beyond the size of a typical giant rat.  

A fully grown brood horror is a ravenous monster whose bloated body belies its incredible speed, which it uses to run down prey before snatching them up with its whip-like tail.  Subterranean races prize brood horrors as deadly mounts.  But, riding one is a dangerous proposition, for even if the brood horror doesn't devour its rider, should it be slain in combat, it will explode in a mass of poisonous filth deadly <br> to enemy and ally alike.

## Hell Pit Abominations
These unholy horrors appear to be an amalgam of a wyrm and a monstrous rat, with an assortment of extra limbs and mouths haphazardly grafted across its body.  Hell pit abominations are such a horrendously chaotic mess of arms and teeth that no two look alike.  They all possess gargantuan bodies that are vaguely draconic in shape but sport grotesquely rat-like features.  

Because of the unique circumstances involved in the creation of any hell pit abomination, the specifics of their appearance can vary wildly, with some looking akin to horrific flesh golems and others appearing to be eldritch horrors from another dimension.  

***Erratic Actions.*** The behavior of hell pit abominations is difficult to predict in combat because their bodies operate in such an unnatural and erratic manner.  One moment the abomination's limbs may work against each other, causing it to barely keep pace with an average human, and the next moment it will gallop across the battlefield at breakneck speeds.

The abomination's attack patterns are similarly unpredictable.  The monster has an assortment of flailing limbs it can use to pummel foes, but if it is gripped with maddening hunger, it may suddenly lash out with its many slavering mouths.  Other times, the abomination's appendages are occupied with twitching spasms, so it settles for throwing its massive girth against every creature in range.

***Undying Horror.*** The unholy energies that lead to the hell pit abomination's creation also make it exceptionally difficult to slay.  Not only do these monsters regenerate at a rapid pace, but their deaths by no means guarantee an end to their terror. 


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some slain abominations unleash one final burst of eldritch lightning to take their foes down with them, while others are host to massive swarms of bloodthirsty rats which burst from their corpse to devour everything in their path.  Still, others refuse to die altogether and surge back to life to continue the battle against their would-be slayers. 

***Unnatural Origin.*** Hell pit abominations aren't born naturally but are the product of twisted, mutagenic magic.  They are most often the result of a wicked, arcane experiment, akin to the creation of a flesh golem, but on a more massive scale.  These monstrosities are crafted from pieces of huge draconic creatures fused with giant rats.  

Other hell pit abominations may have differing origins.  One may be a giant rat subjected to ancient eldritch rituals that turned it into a conduit for the powers of the Far Realm, while another may have once been a primordial rodent monster sleeping underground only to be awoken by the mutating effects of magical radiation.

***Renegades and Warbeasts.*** The sheer power of a hell pit abomination combined with its erratic nature makes it very difficult to control.  Even abominations purposefully created to serve often break free and unleash their own unpredictable rampages.  These free abominations travel to the most abundant food sources they can find and wreak havoc along the way.  They prefer the taste of humanoid flesh and often attack large groups of travelers, villages, and even large cities.  

As terrifying as rogue hell pit abominations are, the most dangerous of their kind are those being directed by intelligent masters.  These monsters combine overwhelming strength with strategic purpose and can serve a range of purposes, from mighty war beast to lair guardian.

## Rat Ogres

These aptly named monstrosities combine the brutish physique of an ogre with rat-like features and agility.  Rat ogres scurry at a speed that belies their hulking forms and can dodge incoming attacks with rodential dexterity before ripping apart their foes with giant's strength.  

For all their physical prowess, rat ogres are incredibly simple and weak-willed.  Without a master directing their actions, they operate only on a level of base instinct.  These directionless rat ogres may mindlessly rampage towards anything that catches their attention or aimlessly wander in confused circles, unable to make any sense of their surroundings.

Rat ogres are unnatural creatures that don't typically arise in the wild and are instead engineered to be brutal minions and beasts of war.  Mad mages and flesh smiths, particularly those of subterranean races, will combine mutating magic and twisted biological engineering to craft these murderous brutes.   This process allows the rat ogre's creator to endow it with custom features to enhance its combat capabilities, meaning there are no guarantees as to what combination of abilities one will be up against when facing one of these customized monsters.

### Rat Ogre Mutations
If you wish to create a rat ogre with added capabilities, you can apply one or more mutations from the Rat Ogre Mutations table.  For each mutation you apply, increase the rat ogre's CR by 1.

## Wererats
These lycanthropes are less physically imposing than other variants of their kind, though they make up for this with cunning and subterfuge.  Wererats rely on ambush tactics and overwhelming numbers more than brute force and take any opportunity to "fight dirty" when engaging their enemies.  If the fight doesn't seem to be going their way, wererats won't hesitate to scurry out of the fray and wait for a more advantageous moment to strike. 

***Lycanthropic Crimelords.***  The rodential stealth and perceptiveness of wererats make them naturally suited towards crime and banditry, and many form clans akin to thief's guilds.  These clans reside in sewers, crumbling ruins, or abandoned warehouses, and they often form a kinship with local rats.  The most powerful of these clans have various breeds of monstrous rats at their disposal, which serve as guardians and attack beasts.

***Plague Locus.***  Rats are notorious for spreading death and disease, and wererats are often fond of doing the same.  However, sometimes a wererat will become so stricken with disease that the sickness it carries becomes one with its lycanthropic curse.  Known as a plague locus, this wretched creature is stuck in perpetual limbo as it is eroded away by sickness while being kept alive by its lycanthropy.  This condition leaves the wererat with the appearance of terminal illness regardless of its form and nullifies the resilience normally gained from lycanthropy.

This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.

&ensp; However, due to the supernatural nature of their affliction, these wererats can weaponize their own sickness, unleashing waves of pestilence and necrosis as they rot away their victims.  Perhaps most terrifying of all, their lycanthropic curse is carried by their diseases, allowing them to more easily inflict other with wererat lycanthropy.  An epidemic started by a wererat plague locus not only ravages communities with disease but leaves fresh swarms of wererats in its wake.

Some plague loci consider themselves unwilling victims.  Exiled from their clan, they look for ways to make the world pay for what has befallen them.  As dangerous as these individuals are, the willing plague loci are truly disturbing.  They see themselves as sacred vessels for divine afflictions.  The suffering they endure is their holy sacrament, and they seek to spread their sacred plague far and wide.  The strong will rise as wererats, and the unworthy will be swept away.

## Wolf Rats

These monstrosities combine the aggression and hunting instincts of wolves with the agility of rats.  Wolf rats roam through the cavernous underground environments and dark forests, always looking for prey to sate their neverending hunger.  No matter how much they eat, they appear malnourished, and they attack any potential meal as though their life depends on it.  

Like owlbears, wolf rats are bizarre hybridized creatures of mysterious origin.  Some claim they are simply one of the many horrors to emerge from the Underdark.  Others believe they were magically engineered as hunting beasts.  If this is the case, they have proven to be unruly and difficult to train.  Wolf rats generally prefer hunting humanoids over taking orders from them.  Those few beast masters who've managed to break them have found wolf rats to be terrifyingly effective at running down and ripping apart soft targets trying to stay out of harm's way.

## Ratfolk

These devious and opportunistic humanoids scurry within the shadowy recesses of other civilizations, where they scheme ways to advance themselves and bring ruin upon their hated enemies.  And the enemies of a ratfolk are many, for most other humanoids view them with fear and disdain.  Thus, ratfolk live hidden within swamps, caves, sewers, or the ruins of other humanoids.  From here, there can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive.  
Some ratfolk find it in their best interest to bargain with and even form alliances with other races.  These alliances are almost always created out of a sense of survivalist pragmatism, and most ratfolk won't hesitate to cast them aside once they are no longer of use.  

### Nimble and Devious
Though ratfolk possess natural agility and a vicious bite, they don't typically confront their foes head-on.  Their smaller frames and lack of resources have made ratfolk accustomed to fighting at a disadvantage.  As such, ratfolk rarely believe in fighting fair.  They are twitchy and quick to scurry away if they perceive themselves in a losing fight.  

Skilled ratfolk can use this natural tendency to their advantage as they whittle enemies down with hit and run tactics.  Ratfolk also become more confident when attacking in numbers and quickly become more vicious when they are part of a swarm overwhelming their foes.

If worst comes to worst and they are <br> forced to flee, ratfolk can quickly squeeze their <br> way into tight crevices to escape attackers.  This  <br>ability also gives them a substantial combat advantage <br> when fighting in their claustrophobic underground homes, where they can pop from hidden alcoves to attack unsuspecting intruders.

### Bringers of Plague and Ruin
Most ratfolk live brutal lives in which pure survival is prioritized above all else.  The idea of shunning a source of power out of fear of corruption or avoiding tactics because they are dishonorable is absurd to them.  As such, ratfolk are known to be masters of many powers and abilities other races consider sinister.  Many ratfolk become deadly assassins, some possessing a supernatural mastery of their wicked craft.  Others tap into the notoriety of rats for swarming through civilization and spreading plagues.  These ratfolk may become carriers for terrible diseases which they can inflict upon their victims, or they may learn to command swarms of other vermin to overwhelm their foes.  Even ratfolk who pursue power through more conventional martial means utilize fear and underhanded tactics to obtain that power.

### Chieftains
These ratfolk occupy some of the highest positions of authority within their society. Chieftans are accomplished warriors and commanders who often command smaller groups of ratfolk within a clan. They usually answer to a more powerful warlord who may have several chieftains at his command. Though they must obey their commander without question, chieftains usually rule their given domain with absolute authority and are quick to quash any potential usurpers. By the same token, chieftains usually eye the position of warlord with envy, and those who are bold and opportunistic enough will eventually make a bid for greater power. 

In combat, chieftains command other ratfolk much in the same way as their warlord superiors. Their elite training, equipment, and resolve make them difficult to defeat, and their commanding presence keeps other ratfolk from routing as easily. As such, chieftains are often put in command of strike forces charged with dangerous missions that require higher levels of bravery than ratfolk are typically inclined to provide.

### Clan Rats

Ratfolk are a prolific, though short-lived, race. They rarely want for numbers, though few of their kind have the opportunity to develop specialized skills. In battle, ratfolk clans leverage the quantity-over-quality approach of their race to field overwhelming numbers of otherwise unremarkable troops. All healthy ratfolk are equipped with basic weapons and armor and given enough rudimentary training to put it to use. These clan rats then utilize their overwhelming mass to break enemy fighters they would otherwise be unable to defeat in a one-on-one fight.

Clan rats are called such because they are most often the core fighting force of a given ratfolk clan. However, clan rat is a broad term, and any healthy but otherwise unremarkable ratfolk with some weapon proficiency and battle gear could be referred to as a clan rat.

#### Volcanic Slashers

Some ratfolk clans make their underground homes in volcanic regions. They quickly learn how to utilize their fiery environment to their advantage, burrowing their homes around magma chambers that provide molten rock, useful for defending their lair with lava traps. The magma also proves useful for forging equipment, and ratfolk of these clans learn to imbue all their weapons with fiery properties. 

The warriors of these clans also prove to be much hardier and heat resilient, as those lacking these qualities don’t last long within their volcanic homes. Known as volcanic slashers, these specialty clan rats combine their high fortitude with flaming weapons to burn their way across the battlefield.

### Grey Seers

These eldritch ratfolk are born with grey or white fur and small horns that set them apart from their kin and mark them for a path of arcane greatness. They are trained to be grey seers, the spiritual leaders of ratfolk society who serve as messengers for their verminous god. This position of divine authority allows grey seers to remain somewhat above the petty machinations and power plays of other ratfolk, and even powerful warlords are weary of incurring the ire of a grey seer and, by proxy, its rat god.

 The favor of the rat god is made evident through the grey seer's devastating magical abilities. Using their ruinous magic, these ratfolk can conjure blasts of elemental magic, summon massive rat tides, or drive their allies into self-destructive battle frenzies. They are also notoriously difficult to pin down in combat, able to scurry just out of reach before unleashing their destructive magic. The protection of the rat god is ever-present, and even those able to make seemingly accurate attacks against a grey seer will often find their strikes suddenly veer off course, or their spells lose potency just as they reach their target.

### Night Runners
While most ratfolk are known for <br> employing sneaky, underhanded tactics, <br> night runners make a career of it.  These <br> skirmishing soldiers fight in mobile packs <br> that utilize stealth and guerilla tactics to harry <br> their foes.  Once foes look sufficiently weakened <br> and vulnerable, night runners move in for the kill, <br> using a flurry of throwing stars and flashing blades <br> to quickly dispatch their victims.  

When working with other ratfolk, night runners serve as light skirmisher infantry who utilize their mobility to harass and disrupt enemies ahead of attacks from other ratfolk.  This is a dangerous task with a low survival rate, ensuring that only the most skilled night runners advance far in their careers.

### Packmasters

Though the many giant rats and other rat  monstrosities lurking beneath the world's surface can be devastating weapons when  unleashed upon one's enemies, few <br> possess the capabilities to control them reliably <br> enough to do so. Ratfolk have a special affinity for <br> such creatures, and ratfolk packmasters are experts <br> at controlling these monsters and goading them into <br> battle. Packmasters utilize whips to keep their <br> bestial charges in line and to use as a weapon <br> when necessary. With each snap of the whip, <br> their war beasts are driven to heightened <br> levels of aggression. 

Packmasters also use wicked weapons <br> known as things-catchers, which, as the name <br> implies, they use to catch things. These <br> two-handed polearms have a large, tong-like <br> head with the inside of their grips lined with <br> spikes. Packmasters can use these weapons to <br> painfully capture and control creatures at a <br> distance, whether it's a new beast to train or <br> an enemy for their beasts to tear apart.

### Plague Censer Bearers

### Poisoned-Wind Globadiers

This insidious ratfolk infantry specializes in the use of poisoned wind globes. These glass orbs unleash clouds of toxic gas when they shatter, overwhelming groups of foes with choking fumes. A squad of these ratfolk can bring <br> down entire enemy formations with poison gas, and they <br> are especially adept at fumigating foes trapped in <br> enclosed spaces. As such, poisoned-wind globadiers are <br> often used to deal with enemies bunkered within rooms <br> or enclosed fortifications.

Poisoned-wind globadiers wear heavy robes and gas <br> masks made to protect them from their poisons, though <br> in combat, this gear can be damaged, leaving them <br> vulnerable to their own gases. This, combined with the fragility of the poisoned wind globes they carry, makes <br> heavy combat hazardous for these ratfolk, and many a globadier has died to the same gases that slew its foes. <br> As such, most globadiers stay out of the fray, dropping poisoned globes in the path of  pursuers.

### Ratfolk Slaves

These ratfolk represent the bottom rung of their <br> society. Numerous and expendable, they are <br> responsible for the lowliest and most dangerous <br> tasks, from unskilled labor to grislily test subjects. <br> Their low quality of life and hazardous duties make <br> their lives mercifully short, and most ratfolk slaves accomplish little with the time they have. 

In battle, other ratfolk use their slaves as canon <br> fodder to bog down foes. Their expendable nature <br> means other ratfolk have few qualms about giving <br> them suicidal tasks, and ratfolk slaves are often <br> subjected to friendly fire from the spells and <br> artillery of their ratfolk “allies.” 

Despite their frail nature and inferior physical <br> abilities, these lowly ratfolk can be quite ferocious <br> when they feel they have the upper hand. They <br> relish the opportunity to be tormenters rather <br> than the tormented and will utilize every <br> underhanded tactic available to them. However, <br> these ratfolk are cowards among a race known <br> for cowardice, and the moment the fight turns <br> against them, they are prone to scurry away. <br> Ratfolk slaves who die a coward’s death are liable <br> to get one last spiteful bite in as recompense for <br> a short, meaningless life of fear and pain.

### Storm Vermin


These ratfolk soldiers are the most massive and elite of their kind. Future storm vermin are identified at a young age by their clan as their size, aggressiveness, and dark fur easily distinguish them from the rest of their litter. They are then raised via brutal training regiments designed to shape them into elite warriors. Packs of storm vermin are given the best equipment in the clan and go on to serve as heavy infantry and personal retinues for powerful ratfolk commanders.

<br><br>

In combat, storm vermin are less prone to the cowardice of most rat folk soldiers. Their higher resolve and heavy armor allow them to hold the line against enemy combatants, and their size, training, and deadly weaponry allow them to cut a swath through most ordinary soldiers. Thus, storm vermin are often charged with protecting critical locations and individuals or leading rallying charges against particularly imposing foes.

#### Council Guard
These albino storm vermin are the most elite bodyguards in the ratfolks' under-empire. Though their origin is unknown, the council guard serve the most elite members of ratfolk society with an unquestioning loyalty almost alien to most ratfolk. No amount of bribery or coercion can shake a guard member's loyalty. They are even mute, thus preventing them from accidentally spilling any of their master's secrets. 


<br>

In combat, these hulking warriors fight with many times the ferocity of an ordinary storm vermin. Their implacable natures mean they will fight to the death if necessary, and no amount of magic can charm or frighten them into submission.

### Warlords

Though ratfolk aren’t known for their valor or powers of leadership, those that rise to the top of their martial <br> hierarchy possess an underhanded ferocity that can’t <br> be denied. These warlords combine martial skill, <br> devious tactics, and the ability to rally their otherwise <br> cowardly kin, making them foes that are <br> underestimated all too often. Even when a ratfolk <br> force appears to be routing, one rallying cry from <br> their warlord can turn them from a fleeing army <br> to one that’s quickly overwhelming their <br> overconfident enemies. 

When engaging enemies, ratfolk warlords can <br> utilize an array of weaponry, though brutal <br> spike fists are among their most favored tools. <br> They never fight fair and often use feinting <br> tactics, fleeing from  enemies who appear to <br> have a strong position and striking back at <br> them the moment they show weakness. <br> These strategies also serve to distract and <br> draw out their foes, allowing their minions to <br> surround and swarm the now vulnerable targets.

# Sharks
These ancient predators are among the most feared beasts in all the seas.  Sharks are fearsome hunters who inspire awe and terror in humanoids crossing their aquatic domains.  While their deadly reputation is well earned, most sharks are content to hunt smaller sea creatures rather than larger land dwellers.  Most dangerous situations arise from severely provoked sharks or those large enough to prey on larger animals such as sea mammals, other sharks, and occasionally ocean-going humanoids.

***Ancient Apex Predators.*** 
It is said that as long as there have been seas teeming with fish, there have been sharks to prey on them.  Throughout the ages, these perfectly designed predators have never needed to adapt or evolve.  Sharks are more cunning than most realize, learning and adapting to their environment while remembering encounters with specific events and individuals.  If a particular trick or tactic is used on a shark once, it is likely to avoid or counter it during a second encounter.  
However, regardless of the encounter, nearly all sharks rely on devastating bites to dismember and slaughter prey.  Sharks will sometimes take an experimental bite to determine if a subject is a potential meal.  Once a shark commits to eating its new victim, it will quickly go into a frenzy, shredding the unfortunate soul into bloody bite-sized pieces.

***Heightened Senses.***
A key component to the shark's success is its array of highly enhanced senses.  Among the most well-known is its extreme sense of smell, specifically enhanced to enable the shark to detect blood from a quarter-mile away.  Sharks lock in on wounded prey this way, and as they draw closer, they can use their electroreception to ensure even the most well-hidden creatures cannot evade them.  This electroreception allows sharks to detect electrostatic fields in their environment, which they use to perceive the electricity generated by the animals around them.

\columnbreak 

&ensp; ***Sea Minions.***
Sharks usually hold special religious significance to cultures living in or near the sea.  These cultures often feature a patron shark god who rules the ocean and uses sharks to enact divine judgment.  The sahuagin are the most strongly tied to sharks, holding the shark god Sekolah as their primary diety.  Their bond with sharks is so strong that they can telepathically communicate with and command any shark they encounter, and the two species are natural allies.

## Bull Sharks
These notorious sharks have earned their name through their stocky shape, broad flat face, and unpredictably aggressive behavior.    Bull sharks reach over 10 feet long and weigh over 200 pounds.  They dwell near coasts and have the unusual ability to travel from saltwater into freshwater, allowing them to roam up rivers and through brackish swamps.  This habitat range often puts bull sharks near humanoid settlements, which, combined with their fierce temper, makes them one of the shark species most likely to attack people.

It is a small blessing that bull sharks are generally solitary hunters.  However, their freshwater adaptability makes them a favored ally of sahuagin raiding parties looking to travel inland via river.  Anyone who attempts to pursue the sahuagin raiders into the water will quickly find themselves surrounded by an ambush party of unruly bull sharks.

## Great White Sharks

These monstrous sea creatures are the most massive of all modern sharks and can reach 20 feet in length and weigh up to 5,000 pounds.  To make matters worse, they are accustomed to hunting larger mammals and often have no qualms attacking humanoids, making them responsible for more coastal attacks than any other shark species.  These attacks usually involve the shark moving in for a single bite before pulling back.  It is unknown whether the sharks disengage as part of a strategy to let their victim bleed out and drown or because they simply find most humanoids unpalatable after the first "taste test."  Regardless, this bite often proves too devastating for the frail humanoid to survive, and without immediate aid, the victim usually dies quickly afterward.

Should a great white shark commit to an attack, the results are devastating.  They are unrelenting hunters, dismembering and devouring anything they view as a meal.  Great whites are more than capable of dispatching medium-sized creatures, sometimes even hunting small whales.  Even retreating to land doesn't guarantee safety from the great white's predations.  Great white sharks are known to breach the ocean's surface to identify potential prey near the water's edge.  They can then wait for their target to venture back into the water or even lunge out at their victim, biting and forcibly dragging it back into the bloody depths to be ripped apart and devoured.

## Hammerhead Sharks

The bizarre appearance of these sea creatures <br> makes  them the most easily recognizable of all <br> sharks.  Hammerhead sharks earn their namesake <br> from their heads' flat, hammer-like shape, <br> significantly increasing the distance between their <br> eyes.  Many different species feature this distinctive <br> head shape, and some can reach nearly 20 feet and <br> weigh over 1,200 pounds.  The intimidation factor of hammerheads is multiplied when they swim in large <br> schools, making them one of the most imposing forces <br> in their ocean home.

The hammerhead's unusual head shape serves an essential role in enhancing the shark's senses.  Not only <br> does it allow the shark a 360-degree view of its <br> surroundings, but it dramatically boosts its <br>electroreception  abilities. These boosted senses enable <br> the hammerhead to sweep ocean floors, looking for <br> hidden prey most other creatures would miss. 

Hunting parties of sahuagin use hammerheads when tracking prey in much the same way humans use bloodhounds.  The hidden quarry is quickly uncovered using the shark's superior senses, leaving it little chance of escape.  Though unprovoked hammerhead attacks on humanoids are rare and don't usually lead to fatalities, these sharks can be deadly and highly perceptive foes while under the influence of sahuagin or other supernatural sources.

## Mako Sharks

These speedy sharks live in open ocean environments where they hunt various sea creatures, from small fish to much larger dolphins.  Mako sharks can reach over 10 feet and weigh nearly 300 pounds.  Their lean, streamlined bodies and warm-blooded nature allows them to swim much faster than most sharks.  This comes with the burden of having a higher metabolism, and these sharks must consume 3 percent of their weight each day to sustain themselves.

While mako sharks are large enough to be a deadly threat to humanoids, they rarely regard non-sea creatures as prey.  Most attacks from mako sharks are provoked and often the result of attempts to hunt them or steal their kills.  Makos are capable of high-speed acrobatic flips out of the water, and open ocean fishers enjoy the challenge of attempting to catch such agile and deadly game.

Matters change entirely once these high-speed killers act in the service of more intelligent beings.  Vengeful sea druids may send schools of makos to purge their oceans of overzealous fishers, and sahuagin use makos as ocean mounts to chase down intruders in their aquatic domain.

## Reef Sharks
As their name suggests, these sharks are found roaming tropical reefs.  They are smaller than the more dangerous sharks, reaching 6 feet in length and rarely weighing more than 50 pounds.  Though their smaller size makes them less deadly to humanoids, reef sharks are still known to attack humanoids who approach them and often become more aggressive in the presence of food.  Spear fishers and careless divers can suddenly find themselves under attack by reef sharks who often swim together in schools.  Though they are not territorial, they are very protective of their personal space and will perform threat displays to drive potential threats who stray too near.  Sauhagin living in or around reefs often use reef sharks as patrol animals to ward off intruders.

## Thresher Sharks

These sharks are easily recognized by their distinctively large tails, which they use to whip and stun their prey.  The sonic pressure at the end of the tail whip allows threshers to disable multiple small fish at once.  Hunting this way enables threshers to isolate fish from schools that would typically be difficult to prey upon.  Sometimes, the thresher will slice prey in half with their powerful tail attacks.

Though threshers can grow to over 15 feet and weigh over 350 pounds, they rarely threaten humanoids.  Humanoids are much larger than their typical prey, and threshers usually only attack them if they feel threatened.  However, threshers influenced by sahuagin or other supernatural forces may begin regarding all humanoids as threats.  In these situations, threshers can quickly inflict devastating damage with their bite and tail attacks.

## Tiger Sharks

These sharks earn their namesake from their striped patterns and deadly hunting prowess.  The tiger shark's coloration and slow movements make it difficult to spot in the water, and once it has moved within range of its prey, it will launch a vicious surprise attack with a sudden burst of speed.  

Tiger sharks can reach over 10 feet, weigh up to 1,400 pounds, and are notorious for regarding almost anything and everything as a potential meal.  Tiger sharks eat fish, jellyfish, cephalopods, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, seals, sea turtles, dolphins, whales, other sharks, land animals, and even garbage.  Their quest to bite into everything imaginable, combined with their coastal hunting territory, makes the tiger shark one of the most likely sharks to attack humanoids, second only to the great white.

> ##### Whitetip Shark
> This shark species lives in the open ocean and is thus less well known than many more notorious sharks.  However, many believe it to be among the most dangerous sharks in terms of lethality to humans.  There are reports of these sharks following boats and preying on shipwreck survivors.  This is an ideal species to use if you want sharks that can threaten players on the open ocean.  The whitetip's size is similar to that of a bull shark, whose stats you can use to represent it.

## Sharks in Your Adventures
The following table provides you with some ways you can incorporate different types of sharks into your adventures. 

##### Shark Adventures

## Dread Megalodon

The megalodon is the largest known predatory animal in existence and the tyrant king of the oceans. Anyone able to control one has a terrifying beast at their disposal, capable of dominating the seas. Still, for some, a "mere" megalodon is not enough.

Aquatic despots and mad artificers may opt to enhance their megalodon minions with extra weaponry and armor plating. This equipment is fused to the megalodon, and its physiology is permanently altered to allow it to control its new weapons as they are an extension of its body. Thus, a dread megalodon is born.

&emsp;***Devestating Arsonal.*** Dread megalodons are terrifying weapons capable of singlehandedly destroying small fleets and laying siege to coastal settlements. Their weaponry gives them long-range striking capabilities against enemies normally safe from a shark's attacks. Arcane cannons are among the most popular weapons attached to dread megalodons, and these magical devices can conjure and fire heavy cannon balls at the shark's will. Other weapon options include massive harpoon launchers, which can reel in prey, and energy beam devices capable of cooking lines of enemies at once.

***Diabolical Pets and Warbeasts.*** Dread megalodons are prized weapons of anyone who controls them. Seafaring or aquatic conquerers will utilize a dread megalodon like a flagship nautical weapon capable of tearing apart enemy fleets and bombarding coastal defenders. Mad geniuses with ambitions of world domination may see a dread megalodon as a prized pet to feed lackluster minions to. Such villains often enjoy subjecting captured heroes to elaborate (though often impractical) death traps involving their dread megalodon. 

### Alternate Weapons

If you wish to arm your dread megalodon with something other than a cannon, you can replace it with one of the following weapons which each provide an attack that replaces the dread megalodon’s cannon attack.

#### Eldritch Ray Gun

***Radiant Beam.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, range 1,000 ft., the megalodon chooses a straight line up to 100 feet long within range, and makes its attack roll against each creature of its choice in that line.  If the line is no longer than 10 feet long, it has advantage on these attack rolls. *Hit:* 7d6 (24)  radiant damage to the target.

#### Harpoon Launcher
***Harpoon.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, range 100/200 ft., one target. *Hit:* 55 (9d10 + 7) piercing damage. If the target must succeed on a Strength contest against the megalodon or be pulled up to 100 feet toward the megalodon.

## Isonades
This monstrous shark stalks busy fishing routes, preferring stormy or murky waters that reduce visibility and help it to sneak up on its prey. The isonade's preferred prey is not the fish along these routes but the fishermen, and its victims are often snatched right off their boat without a trace of their passing.

***Fisher of Fishermen.*** The isonade possesses a long, dexterous, hooked tail it uses to snatch up its prey. Sailors near the edge of their boat may suddenly be pulled overboard before they can even shout, and the isonade has the uncanny ability to sneak up and perform such attacks while no one else is looking. One by one, the boat's crew may disappear, with the terrified sailors unaware of the monster's presence. 

Even travelers on larger ships, where the deck is far above the water's surface, are not safe. When the isonade spots an isolated target near the railing of such a ship, it can leap 40 feet out of the water to reach its victim, yanking them overboard to a watery grave.

***Barbed Armor.*** Even those able to put up a fight against the isonade find themselves pitted against an unnaturally fearsome foe. Not only does the isonade combine the natural ferocity of a shark with an unnatural hook tail, but it is also clad in armor-plating covered in wicked barbed spines. Those who tangle with the isonade in melee, or are snatched by its tail, risk being hooked to the monster, unable to flee as it drags them into the depths.

***Anti-Naval War Beast.*** Isonades are feared and revered by sahuagin, for they are potent allies but dangerously difficult to control, with only especially powerful sahuagin able to do so. Isonades working alongside sahuagin are used to counter enemy ships by preying on their crew. The isonade pulls sailors overboard, where the sahuagin can easily dispatch them. Sometimes the isonade rapidly pulls as many enemies overboard as possible, and other times it waits until a key target is vulnerable before striking. Eventually, the ship is deprived of critical combatants, with the survivors staying away from the deck's edge. This paves the way for the sahuagin's attack as they climb aboard the ship and slaughter the remaining crew.

# Terlen
These monstrous sharks sport <br> massive wings allowing them to <br> extend their hunting range to land <br> and air. Storms provide them with <br> ideal hunting conditions as the heavy <br> wind and rain provide cover for their  sneak attacks. Terlen often attack in flocks that ambush prey and tear them apart using hit-and-run tactics. They prefer vulnerable targets in the open and use their speed to prevent their victim's escape.

The terlen's origins are a mystery, but it is thought to originate from the oceans of the lower planes. Its wandering nature and flexible means of locomotion allow it to wander from one plane to the next and even occasionally enter the Material Plane. Other times terlen are summoned by powerful beings such as sea gods, who wish to unleash these monsters on mortals who foolishly believe they can avoid the ocean's wrath by staying inland. 

Some mortals summon terlen in an attempt to utilize them as an all-terrain attack force or even as mounts. Though this often results in the summoner being torn to shreds, those who succeed can bring a terrifying strike force to bear against their enemies.

# Tigers
The largest and deadliest of all cats, <br> tigers are the kings of their domain. <br> Their power and beauty elevate <br> them to an almost mythical status <br> amongst many humanoids.  Some <br> view them as the wrath of the gods <br> made flesh, while others see them <br> as the ultimate predators against which one can <br> truly test their metal. 

***Predators Supreme.*** Tigers can reach over 10 <br>  feet in length, and their intensely muscular bodies <br> can weigh nearly 700 pounds.  Due to their sheer <br> mass and power, few creatures are safe from a <br> tiger's predation. Thanks to the tiger's striped <br> camouflage and long pouncing distances, even animals <br> large and powerful enough to pose a threat to a tiger rarely notice it in time to mount an effective defense. Thanks to their deadly ambush capabilities, tigers can hunt down larger creatures as dangerous as mountain gorillas and even brown bears.  

Once a tiger surprises its prey with a pounce, it will knock its victim prone and use its claws and teeth to lock down and quickly finish the kill.   A prone victim has little chance of fighting back and is rapidly ripped apart before being dragged off by the tiger to be consumed. 

***Maneaters.*** While tigers primarily hunt animals living across jungles, forests, and occasionally mountains, they often hunt stray humanoids when the opportunity presents itself. A lone traveling humanoid will usually be seen as an easy meal to a tiger, and some may even be bold enough to attempt to pick off a humanoid traveling with a group.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some notorious tigers take a personal liking toward hunting humanoids. A tiger that has been "wronged"  by someone will often make a point of hunting down and exacting vengeance upon the offender. These offenders are usually individuals who injured the tiger in a previous encounter or stole one of its kills. Other tigers will decide to make humanoids their primary prey.   These tigers will stalk the outskirts of isolated villages and pick off stray inhabitants, leaving the population terror-stricken.

&emsp;***Dire Tigers.*** These primeval terrors represent the dangerous aspects of the tiger amplified to a greater level of deadliness.  They are larger and more muscular than other tigers, reaching nearly 900 pounds.  They are bolder than other tigers and attack humanoids without hesitation, even those traveling in groups.  They are more resilient than other tigers, and even groups of veteran hunters often fail to slay these mighty beasts.

Many believe dire tigers to be the ancient cousins of "modern tigers" and remnants from a long-lost age.  Whatever their origin, they are often put to use by other beings who wish to punish or test the metal of humanoid adventurers.  Druids enlist the aid of dire tigers to protect their realms from unwanted incursions, and divine forces may unleash dire tigers upon mortals as a form of deadly punishment for their transgressions.

## Weretigers
These lycanthropes blend the hunting <br> prowess of a tiger with the intelligence <br> and versatility of a humanoid, creating <br> proud individuals who view themselves <br> as apex hunters.  
While not evil by nature, weretigers often have a <br> superiority complex that drives them to hunt all <br> manner of dangerous game to demonstrate <br> their place at the top of the food chain.  This <br> hunting is done with a detached refinement, and <br> weretigers will rarely revert to their bestial forms <br> if they can help it, preferring to remain calm and in control.  

Though weretigers become frustrated when pushed to the point of losing their cool and transforming into their bestial forms, deep down, they crave the challenge.  While a weretiger may take smug satisfaction from easily dispatching dangerous prey, a true challenge that pushes the limits of its abilities will be a treasured victory.  

Weretigers are also very careful about who they pass their lycanthropy to, as they view it as a privilege and a burden.  Weretigers have an exclusivist attitude and are loath to introduce unnecessary and unworthy competition.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, when weretigers find exceptional hunters or even humanoid prey that exceed their expectations, they may choose to pass their lycanthropy onto such individuals, thereby creating worthy rivals for future competitions.

# Toads
These tiny amphibians somehow appear both unassuming and ominous.  Though they pose little threat on their own, toads are often associated with witchcraft and dark curses.  These associations often cause toads to be viewed through the lens of superstitious folklore, where they are seen as dark omens or as central figures in fairytales.

***Poisonous Nature.*** Despite being similar in size and appearance to frogs, toads lack their leaping capabilities and generally walk more than they do hop.  Like frogs, toads also lack any offensive abilities against larger creatures, so they must make up for this lack of mobility with tougher skin which secrets a poison that makes the toads unappealing meals for predators.  This tougher skin also retains water for longer periods of time, allowing the toad to roam further from water than frogs.

Some species of toads are known for having hallucinogenic properties, and creatures affected by their poison experience vivid visions and even a sense of euphoria.  While these forms of poison may be more exciting or even blissful, they are no less dangerous and can still severely harm any creature foolish enough to lick the toad.

***Knots of Toads.*** When groups of toads come together, they are referred to as a knot.  While this typically happens during mating events and is entirely harmless to others, supernatural forces can sometimes lead to the formation of an aggressive knot of toads capable of overwhelming much larger creatures.  While the individual toads of the knot pose little threat, en masse, they engulf their targets, subjecting them to overwhelming amounts of their poisonous secretions.  Knots of toads behaving in this way are often summoned by vengeful witches, hags, druids, or even gods as a supernatural punishment for perceived slights.

&emsp;***Giant Toads.*** While toads are adept at catching and swallowing smaller creatures whole, mundane-sized toads pose little threat to humanoids.  However, this situation changes entirely if the toad becomes significantly larger than the typical humanoid.  Giant toads pose a real and terrifying threat, and many fledgling adventurers have met an early and inglorious end in the belly of one of these beasts.

Some giant toads are created as the result of dark or druidic magic, and they are a favorite pet of hags and a common guardian for druids.  Though they are not malevolent by nature, giant toads view humanoids as the ideal meal-sized creature.  A giant toad won’t hesitate to leap out of hiding after a group of travelers, gulp up the nearest person, and flee with its new meal.

> ## Giant Toad
>*Large beast, unaligned*
> ___
> - **Armor Class** 11
> - **Hit Points** 39 (6d10 + 6)

> ***Amphibious.*** The toad can breathe air and water.
>
> ***Poisonous Secretion.*** A creature that touches the toad must make DC 13 Constitution saving throw at the end of the turn or become poisoned for the next 12 hours. After every hour that elapses while the creature is poisoned, it takes 3 (1d6) poison damage. The poisoned creature or a creature within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check to end the effect.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target is large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the toad can't bite another target.
>
> ***Swallow.*** The toad makes one bite attack against a medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time. If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone.

## Cauldron Toads
These alchemical mutants are living vessels for caustic brews. Though superficially, they have the forms of ordinary toads, cauldron toads are filled with vile chemicals which constantly seep from their every orifice, leaving trails of noxious fumes wherever they go. They are usually found in areas filled with alchemical pollution, and some believe them to be toads mutated by such pollution, while others believe they are created from magical concoctions. When bothered, cauldron toads can quickly belch forth the caustic contents within, horribly burning their unfortunate targets.

***Alchemical Assistants.*** Cauldron toads have an affinity for any who dabble in dark alchemy. Hags and mad alchemists will sometimes keep cauldron toads as guardians and assistants. These toads have the peculiar ability to store the contents of potions within themselves and can even be used in lieu of alchemists' tools to create such potions. Despite their dismal intelligence, these pets are quite diligent in following their master's orders. They will faithfully deliver and administer potions as directed, even resuscitating their allies with healing potions when needed.

***Giant Cauldron Toads.***  Just as giant toads tower over ordinary toads, these massive cauldron toads tower over their lesser kin. They can belch forth enormous amounts of caustic acid, which often contain the remains of previously devoured victims. Some particularly mad alchemists will feed "ordinary" cauldron toads vile chemicals which grow and mutate them into giant cauldron toads to serve as guardians and even mounts.

***Knots of Cauldron Toads.*** When groups of cauldron toads are attracted to a source of particularly intense source of alchemical pollution, the potency of their environment can drive them into a frenzy. They will form a knot of cauldron toads and attack anything in sight, dissolving their victims in a tide of caustic chemicals. Skilled alchemists can herd these knots into their foes, and some will even <br> develop special concoctions made to <br> drive  cauldron toads into frenzied <br> knots  when the situation calls for <br> such measures.

&emsp;***Monstrous Cauldron Toads.*** These massive creatures loom over even giant cauldron toads. They are exceedingly rare and can only be found near the most potent sources of alchemical pollution. Only the most powerful alchemists can hope to control a monstrous cauldron toad with any kind of success. All others are quickly devoured.

Those who can control this monstrosity have a devastating minion at their disposal. The monstrous cauldron toad's size allows it to dominate the battlefield, and it can vomit huge globs of burning fluid to digest its victims at a range. Worse yet, the massive amounts of alchemical pollution it leaves behind will often spawn new cauldron toads, continuing the toxic cycle of corruption.

## Hypnotic Toads

&emsp;***Otherworldly Enigmas.*** None know of the true origins of the hypnotic toad, and many doubt their existence altogether.  They may be the result of an arcane experiment gone awry, the influence of the Far Realm, or an extraterrestrial incursion.  

Regardless of their origin, hypnotic toads possess the supernatural ability to dominate the will of creatures they make eye contact with.  The hypnotic toad can have many creatures under its control this way, so long as they stay within its vicinity.  The creatures under the hypnotic toad’s control exist in a trance-like state and receive telepathic commands from their new master, which they follow to the letter.

***All Glory to the Hypnotic Toad.*** While hypnotic toads possess the power to mentally enslave creatures and use them for whatever means they choose, the goals of the hypnotic toad are often inscrutably bizarre.  They will often use their powers to inject themselves into humanoid society, forcing others to accept their presence as they pursue their goals.  

These goals might involve taking on a prominent social role in the community, building a traveling entourage of followers, or winning a local contest.  The hypnotic toad’s reasons for these pursuits are unknowable, but the creatures under its control are forced to slavishly comply, and they will even throw themselves into harm’s way should anything or anyone threaten their master.

***Giant Hypnotic Toads.*** While most hypnotic toads lack physical prowess and rely entirely on their hypnotic abilities, some can grow to monstrous sizes, granting them the ability to overpower and devour those who displease this almighty hypnotic toad.  This increased size enhances the hypnotic toad’s powers of domination, allowing it to force creatures to look into its eyes so they may be subjected to its hypnotic control.

Giant hypnotic toads have the power to control entire townships and form bizarre cults.  Some may demand to be worshiped as gods, while others may simply elect themselves the town’s mayor.   Whatever their goal, giant hypnotic toads accept nothing less than total obedience and will not hesitate to devour those who interfere with their schemes.

## The Gitrog Monster
The Gitrog Monster is a figure of legend, feared by those living in certain remote villages.  The tales surrounding this creature are often vague and contradictory, but they all describe a monstrous lake-dwelling amphibian that feeds on villagers and their livestock.  The presence of the Gitrog Monster in or near a village spells doom for its helpless inhabitants.

***Unknown Number and Origin.*** While the legends refer to a single creature known as the Gitrog Monster, how many of these abominations actually exist is unknown.  It may be a single legendary creature or a rare breed of monstrosities that rarely make their presence overtly known.

The Gitrog’s origin is equally ambiguous.  Because of the striking similarities between their powers and those of hypnotic toads, those who have studied the Gitrog extensively believe that it may have once been a giant hypnotic toad.  How it would have gained this level of power and status is unknown.  Perhaps a particularly ancient hypnotic toad devoured enough of its followers to grow into an even greater monster.  Or, a hypnotic toad may have been warped by strange, eldritch powers from another world.  Whatever the case, the Gitrog’s inscrutable mind betrays no secrets of its past nor plans for its future.

***Cult Followings.*** The Gitrog Monster possesses most of the abilities of a giant hypnotic toad, albeit at a much higher level of power.  However, the ways in which the Gitrog utilizes its powers differ from its lesser cousins.  Whereas hypnotic toads often make themselves publicly known as they take on prominent local positions within a community, the Gitrog remains hidden away from public view.  Though it usually stays out of sight, the weight of the Gitrog’s presence is felt throughout the entire community.  
Rather than inject itself into petty social games, the Gitrog uses its influence to create dark cults with itself at the center.  These cults are formed by inhabitants from any nearby village, and the cult’s members may include those serving purely out of fear or dark pragmatism and desire for power.  Still, other members are true believers in the Gitrog’s greatness, their psyche shattered, leaving them only with the desire to do whatever is necessary to serve their horrific master’s whims.

# Turkeys

These fowl are prized by hunters and a common feature at large celebratory feasts.  Farmers keep some domesticated variations of turkey specifically to provide food to locals.  These turkeys are incapable of flight and are bred to provide ample supplies of meat.  

Wild turkeys are capable of short bursts of flight which they use to escape prey and ascend into the safety of tree tops.  However, turkeys don't fly for extended durations and spend most of their time foraging for food on the ground.  

Compared to most birds capable of flight, turkeys are relatively large, weighing up to 24 pounds and reaching 4 feet in length.  Their size, talons, and aggressive behavior can make them a threat to the unprepared.  

## Dungeon Turkeys
These eccentric fey spirits take the form of turkeys, though they often embellish their appearance with exotic color variations or off-beat articles of clothing.  They spend most of their time traveling to remote and dangerous locations where they will hide in out-of-the-way areas waiting to be discovered by adventurers.  These hiding places might include hidden alcoves, hard-to-reach chests, or the inside of crumbling walls.  

Once adventurers discover a dungeon turkey, it will gleefully taunt them as it flees from their reach.  The turkey will make every attempt to goad adventurers into pursuing it as it escapes further afield into dangerous territory.  If the adventurers manage to slay or capture it, the turkey will congratulate them on a good chase before its spirit returns home.  The body it leaves behind will instantly transform into a magical, fully cooked turkey capable of replenishing weary heroes' vitality and magical reserves.

***Magical Defenses.***
While dungeon turkeys enjoy being chased by adventurers, they are loath to make the chase easy.  Their innate elusiveness makes them very difficult to strike or grapple, they can blind onlookers with dazzling fey magic, and they can even reflect spells back upon their casters.  Especially powerful dungeon turkeys can even teleport to elude would-be captors.  

***Dramatic Chases.***
Some dungeon turkey pursuits are relatively straightforward, but most like to make the chase more interesting.  They will flee through dangerous terrain, goading adventurers to chase after them.  If the turkey escapes, it will usually find a new hiding spot and wait to be discovered so it can repeat the game all over again.

Most dungeon turkeys have no interest in being pursued by monsters and other dungeon denizens and will usually avoid drawing their attention.  However, some particularly dramatic turkeys will wait until adventurers are engaged in a fight to pop out from a hiding spot and invite a chase mid-combat.

***Unusual Means and Motivations.*** 
Dungeon turkeys generally don't provide a coherent explanation as to why they engage in the games they do beyond that 'it is just their nature.'  Sometimes they are sent by other powerful fey who wish to provide adventurers aid, provided they can earn it.  Whatever the reason, dungeon turkeys have a knack for making their way into even the most remote and dangerous of locations while avoiding the attention of local creatures.

# Umibōzu
These towering monsters lurk <br> beneath the ocean's waves, waiting <br> for any opportunity to prey on vulnerable <br> ships. When the umibōzu emerges from the water, it reveals its large shadowy head devoid of all features save two large piercing white eyes. Its head sits atop a lower body that sports two long tendril-like arms and becomes increasingly amorphous the further down one looks. Umibōzu are fickle creatures and seek twisted and ritualistic ways to bring doom upon any ship that crosses their path.

***Reborn Souls of the Lost.*** The origins of the umibōzu are shrouded in mystery. Some legends claim they were once clerics in service of sea gods who managed to displease their deities. The vindictive gods dragged their disgraced subjects to the bottom of the sea and twisted them into the umibōzu as a form of divine punishment. These legends have led to the belief that umibōzu specifically hunt other clerics forsaken by their gods or faltering in their faith.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Others believe umibōzu are amalgams of souls that were lost at sea and are now unable to find peace due to lacking a proper burial. The inability to find peace leads the umibōzu to torment and drown others at sea so they, too, may experience the despair of dying in the waves and never knowing rest.

***Terror of the Sea.*** The arrival of an umibōzu is heralded by a raging storm as it emerges from the ocean's surface. Though it can smash most ships apart with its bare limbs, it will often toy with a crew of victims. The umibōzu will offer to spare the sailors if they offer it an empty barrel. If the barrel is provided, the umibōzu will magically transform it into a container capable of holding massive amounts of water and use it to scoop up the ocean's waves and throw them at the ship's crew, attempting to knock them into the sea and drown them. Once the umibōzu has this container, it will utilize it this way with a compulsive fervor that borders on ritualistic. Umibōzu are so committed to the use of their container that, should they be provided a barrel with its bottom missing, they will still try to use the useless implement, heedless of the water continually falling through it. Wiley sailors can use this ploy to buy them a chance at escaping the befuddled umibōzu.

***Challenge Rating in the Water.*** If the umibōzu is being confronted underwater with no means of getting out of the same body of water it's occupying, its CR should be considered as 2 levels higher.


#### Lair Actions

When fighting inside its lair, an umibōzu can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the umibōzu can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated. An umibōzu in its layer CR is 16.

* A wall of water forms in an unoccupied space on top of or in a body of water. The wall can be up to 10 feet long, 30 feet high, and 5 feet thick. Just before the layer action of the next turn is taken, the wall moves up to 30 feet in any direction in or along the surface of the water. Any creature other than the Umibōzu inside the wall or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or take 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage and be pushed ahead of the wall for the rest of its movement. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not moved. At the end of this movement, the wall disappears

* 30-foot radius centered on a point in water within the lair begins to churn. Just before the lair action of the next turn is taken, any creature other than umibōzu in that area must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or take 28 (8d6) bludgeoning damage and be pulled 15 feet toward the area's center. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't pulled.

> ***Freedom of Movement.*** The umibōzu ignores difficult terrain, and magical effects can't reduce its speed or cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.
>
> ***Sea Link.*** The umibōzu takes 20 psychic damage when it starts its turn outside a body of salt water.
>
> ***Siege Monster.*** The umibōzu deals double damage to objects and structures.
>
> ***Storm Aura.*** The umibōzu emanates a stormy magical aura that extends 300 feet from it in every direction, but not through total cover. All unprotected flames in its area that are torch-sized or smaller are extinguished. The attack rolls of ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the projectile they fire moves more than 15 feet through the aura. The aura hedges out vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by a strong wind. The area of the aura is difficult terrain for creatures, and any creature other than the umibōzu that ends its turn swimming or flying in this area must succeed on a 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. The umibōzu can cause this storm to become inactive at any time (no action required.)

wearing or carrying.

>
> ***Drowning Grasp.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target touching the same body of water as the umibōzu. *Hit:* 43 (8d8 + 7) force damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC 20) and pulled 30 feet toward the umibōzu. Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, blinded, and unable to breathe or speak. The umibōzu has two hands, each of which can grapple only one target. At the start of each of the umibōzu's turns, each target grappled by it takes 43 (8d8 + 7) magical bludgeoning damage.
> 
> ***Scoop.*** The umibōzu uses its Drowning Implement to scoop up 30 gallons of water and fling it at a point within 100 feet of it. Creatures and objects within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from the point. If a creature fails the save by 10 or more, it is pushed 20 feet away instead. The water then spreads out across the ground in all directions, extinguishing unprotected flames within 30 feet of the chosen point.
>
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Drowning Implement.*** The umibōzu touches a small non-magical container that it has been given by another creature, causing it to become the umibōzu's Drowning Implement. The Drowning Implement is a magical item that acts as a bag of holding, except it can only contain liquids, and all other items placed within it are expelled into its nearest unoccupied space. The umibōzu can only have one Drowning Implement at a time, and if it uses this action while it already has a Drowning Implement, the previous container loses its magic, and its contents spill out. The Drowning Implement has 70 hit points and AC 16.
>
> ### Legendary Actions
> The umibōzu's can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Umibōzu regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Check.** The umibōzu's makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> **Scoop.** The umibōzu uses its Scoop action.
>
>  **Tenacious Will.** If the umibōzu's is suffering a effect that require it to make a saving throw, it may immediately make a save against the effect with advantage, ending the effect on a success. It can use this action while incapacitated.
>
> **Sea Terror.**  The umibōzus forces a creature that it can see within 100 feet of it to make DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails the saving throw, it is frightened of the Umibōzu until the end of the creature's next turn. If the creature is submerged in water while frightened this way, it immediately takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage, and the condition ends.

# Water Horses
These shape-shifting fey live within rivers and lakes but spend much of their time assuming the form of a horse, roaming the countryside, and looking for victims they can charm into riding them. Many folktales warn of waters horses, for once a creature attempts to ride them, they will promptly dive into the nearest body of water where they can drown and devour their victim. There are several variants of water horses, and while there are differences between their behaviors and abilities, they share several characteristics.

***Charming Shapeshifters.*** While water horses can assume the form of any large, land-dwelling creature they choose, their preferred form is that of a beautiful horse. Regardless of its chosen shape, the water horse's true form becomes impossible to hide once it dives into the water. Its mane reverts into watery reeds, its flesh reveals its sallow complexion, and many have fanged and even monstrous skulls that come on full display. 

Regardless of what form they assume, all water horses possess the ability to charm those who look upon them. Though the power of this charming ability varies from horse to horse, the result is the same. The charmed creature will cease to see the horse as a threat and be compelled to attempt to ride what they now view as the most beautiful horse they've ever seen. Many of the water horse's victims never have the chance to put up a fight.

***Adhesive Bodies.*** The primary tactic all water horses share is to lure or drag their victims into rivers or lakes. Most have sticky flesh they can use as an adhesive, causing those who touch them to become stuck. This makes it easier for the water horse to drag its prey into the water, where it has the advantage.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

***Aquatic Herds.*** While many water horses spend extended periods alone, they still possess the horse's innate tendency to form herds. When several water horses congregate, they instinctively form roving herds that migrate across vast stretches of water. While these herds are breathtaking to behold, they can also be devastating to any village they pass by if left unchecked.

***Loyal Steeds and Servants.*** While most water horses are wild, chaotic predators, there are instances where they can be subdued and made into powerful servants. Powerful fey sometimes "tame" these creatures, turning them into amphibious mounts and servants. Hags, in particular, enjoy bending water horses to their will and using them to spy and prey upon nearby villages.

Humanoids can sometimes subdue and tame water horses using enchanted cold iron tacks. Water horses tamed this way may even become loyal steeds, helping their rider to navigate dangerous underwater environments. A water horse tamed this way can charm other water horses, thereby making them friendlier to the rider, and there are tales of legendary figures who have taken control of entire herds of water horses.

## Kelpies
Kelpies are the most notorious and well-known of the water horses, as well as the female variant of these fey creatures. In their natural form, kelpies have long, reedy manes that drape across their pale, greenish complexions, and their eyes possess an eerily beautiful and haunting glow. When not in the water, kelpies drip with heavy mud, and their reeds weigh them down, preventing them from achieving the same level of land mobility as other horses. As such, they tend to stay closer to their homes than other water horses, preferring instead to lure creatures into their river domain.   

***Beguiling Predators.*** Kelpies prefer to prey upon lone, vulnerable targets, using their charms to separate an individual from nearby companions. They will then lure the victim out into the water, and once the isolated target touches the kelpie, it will quickly pull it to the bottom of its river home and well out of the reach of any help from its companions.  

***Charming Fey Steeds.*** River-dwelling fey prize kelpies as reliable and enchanting steeds, and especially powerful fey may have entire herds of kelpies at their command.  They may even grant the services of these kelpies to those in their favor.  This can result in some kelpies aiding noble heroes and serving as stalwart steeds in battles against other aquatic monstrosities.  

Other kelpies are put to more sinister use.  Hags enjoy utilizing kelpies to lure travelers into their clutches and will also employ kelpies in larger schemes, where they are used as spies.  Hags will sometimes “gift” a kelpie disguised as a beautiful horse to someone.  The kelpie then serves as a secret servant for the hag until the time comes to betray its would-be owner.

## Nuggles
These water horses are by far the most distinct of their kind, and some scholars argue that nuggles are, in fact, a type of fey entirely separate from the rest of their supposed kin.  Though they have the same pale, reedy characteristics of other water horses in their natural forms, nuggles are significantly smaller and more akin to ponies than horses.  When they shapeshift, their preferred form is that of a small, shaggy pony, though their wheel-shaped tail always gives them away, despite their attempts to conceal it between their legs.

***Mischievous Ponies.*** Unlike other water horses, the nuggle is not known to consume humanoid flesh.  Though it still enjoys diving into the water with unsuspecting humanoids aboard its back, its goal is usually to prank rather than to kill.  Nuggles still possess the charming abilities of other water horses and will use them to play tricks on others, with children being their favorite targets.  As a result, children from riverside villages are often told cautionary tales, warning them about mischievous ponies with wheel-shaped tails that will try to lure them near water.

***Fast and Bewildering.*** In terms of their abilities, the most significant difference between the nuggle and other water horses is their lack of adhesiveness.  Rather than rely on creatures becoming stuck to its back, the nuggle utilizes sudden bursts of speed to dash into the nearest body of water before the rider can react.  

\columnbreak

Once it has its rider in the water, the nuggle will complete its prank by subjecting the creature to fey magic that leaves it dazed and confused for the next hour. The nuggle usually ensures the creature doesn’t drown and will often leave their would-be rider in a state of hazy bewilderment as it gallops away with neighing laughter.

***Bane of Watermills.*** The wheel shape of the nuggle’s tail indicates where they most enjoy making mischief: watermills. Nuggles are known to enjoy living near watermills, much to the dismay of watermill operators. They possess the ability to summon grasping reeds which they use to clog and entangle the moving components of watermills. Those charged with maintaining watermills near nuggle territory quickly learn to leave meals out to placate the mischievous water pony. So long as the nuggle is appeased through these small offerings, it will leave the watermill be.

***Fear of Fire.*** If a nuggle becomes too problematic for the local populous, villagers or fledgling adventurers may attempt to drive it out of the region entirely. Luckily, nuggles are not known for their bravery and have a particular fear of fire. Fire-wielding adventurers or a torch-wielding mob are usually enough to send a nuggle fleeing, and heated iron pokers, partially those made from cold iron, are especially effective at driving them off.

## Nykur 
These creatures are the male counterparts to kelpies, though they lack the heavy, mud-laden manes of kelpies and are much better suited to land travel. Unlike kelpies, which prefer to stay near the water and lure lone victims, nykurs are brazen showboaters who enjoy roaming long distances and seeking attention from onlooking crowds. 

***Overpowering Beauty.*** Nykurs prefer assuming the forms of dazzling white stallions, and their overpowering charm affects all onlookers. Unlike kelpies, nykurs don't play coy and will trot into full view of as many people as possible. Though these ego-fueled displays are effective at disrupting large groups at once, their brazenness can often work against their best interests in situations where subtlety would be a more tactful approach to achieving their ends.   

***Deceptive Work Horse.*** Nykurs sometimes "volunteer" their services to farmhands to put their supernatural strength and vitality on full display. They will arrive at a small farm and spontaneously steal work from other horses, much to the confusion and awe of the farmers. The nykurs will plow fields and perform other farm labor in a fraction of the time it would take a typical horse, and they ensure they look good doing it. Only once they've sufficiently captivated their onlookers will they drag their charmed victims into the water to devour them.

#### Cold Iron Tack
*Wonderous item, uncommon*

This riding equipment is made with enchanted cold iron. As an action, it can be equipped or removed from a willing or incapacitated water horse. If the water horse is hostile to the creature equipping it, the water horse must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by that creature. If the creature that equipped the tack or any of its allies do anything harmful to the water horse, it may repeat this saving throw, ending the charmed condition on a success.

A water horse that passes its saving throw against the tack cannot be charmed by it for the next 24 hours.

# Water Stallions

Water horses are a shapeshifting fey that prefer to live near freshwater environments. They can use their supernatural charms and adhesive bodies to capture humanoids and drag them deep into the water, where they drown and devour their victims. They use their shapeshifting abilities to assume the forms of beautiful horses, but their true form is revealed when they are submerged in water. Their shining manes transition to slimy reeds, and their once beautiful skin turns greenish and sallow.

One type of male water horse, known as a nykur, is particularly known for its brazen confidence and desire to be noticed by humanoids. It goes out of its way to display its beauty and strength, using its magical charms to leave onlookers awestruck. Though nykurs are usually predatory, often using their charms and cunning to hunt humanoids, they are typically not malicious by nature.   

However, some nykurs undergo a dark transformation from a narcissistic predator into a sadistic serial killer known as a water stallion, or in some cases referred to as an each-usige. This transformation might result from the water horse betraying and consuming its former fey master or spending a long period in corrupted waters. A shift may also occur if a water stallion has been spurned and rejected to the point that hatred and resentment have warped its very being. Whatever the case, these water stallions possess power and malevolence beyond that of any other water horse.

***Brutal Serial Killers.*** Whereas other water horses kill primarily for food, the water stallion takes sadistic pleasure in the art of murder.  

\columnbreak

They are never satisfied with their body count and will take any opportunity to increase it regardless of whether they need the food or not. This brutality makes it nearly impossible for other creatures to subdue water stallions and use them as servants or allies. As a result, even other water horses shun them, and given the opportunity, water stallions will prey upon and tyrannize their former kind.

***Obsessive Stalkers.*** While water stallions possess an unquenchable desire for murder, they can still hide their true nature by using their fey charms and shapeshifting ability. 
Worse still, they can shapeshift into humanoids, allowing them to better pursue and deceive their victims. 
They still possess the egotistical needs of a nykur and will typically assume the form of a handsome, charming young man. However, their malevolent nature transforms simple attention-seeking into twisted stalking and mind games. The water stallion will often fixate on a single individual he sees as the worthiest of his attention and then relentlessly stalk and attempt to charm this creature. The more the individual rejects the water stallion, the more aggressively he pursues his target. The ultimate goal is to seduce his victim and lure them back to his watery lair, where they can be devoured. If his charms fail, the spurned and furious water stallion will resort to force and attempt to abduct his target.

***Undying Evil.*** The malevolence of a water stallion is so great it can sometimes continue to sustain its life even after its body has been broken. A defeated water stallion's body unravels into a mass of slime and seaweed with a grizzly horse skull floating at its center. Putting a permanent end to a water stallion is very difficult without the aid of cold iron, and some adventurers craft holy symbols made of cold iron specifically to aid in the destruction of this monstrous fey.

### A Water Stallion's Lair
A water stallion will typically make its lair at the bottom of a lake or loch, surrounded by kelp or other aquatic plants. Here it keeps the remains of victims along with other macabre trophies. While in its lair, the stallion can cloud the waters and turn plants against its attackers, pulling and entangling them so it can better toy with its victims. A water stallion in its lair has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP).

#### Lair Actions
When fighting inside its lair, a water stallion can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the water stallion can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

* The water stallion casts the *entangle* spell (Charisma is its spellcasting ability) at its lowest level requiring no components and with a spell save  DC 17. The water stallion doesn't need to concentrate on the spell, which ends on initiative count 20 of the next round.

* A plant in the lair shoots out and grabs a creature within 30 feet of it. That creature must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled into the plant's space.

* The water stallion casts the fog cloud spell (Charisma is its spellcasting ability) at its lowest level requiring no components. The spell doesn't require concentration and ends on initiative count 20 of the next round.

### Mythic Encounter
If you wish to make the encounter with the water stallion an even greater threat, you can turn it into a mythic encounter.  

In this scenario, the water stallion uses its Unravel trait to heal back all its hit points and will lose its charming presence as its form unravels into a mass of slime and seaweed. Its mythic actions are then added to its list of available legendary actions. A water stallion mythic encounter is equivalent to two creatures with its CR in the same encounter; as such, award double the XP awarded for a non-mythic encounter.

If you plan to use this type of encounter, players should be provided clues about the water stallion's weakness to cold iron. They may have the opportunity to learn of this before the fight. For example, there may be a drowned body in its layer with a cold iron item on it. Alternatively, an NPC who was about to become the water stallion's latest victim might provide a source of cold iron to the players during the fight.  

You can use the following description when the water stallion uses its unravel trait:


> The water stallion's body unravels into dark reeds that don't fall to the ground but instead twist and weave in the air as though held by an unseen current. 
Amongst the mass of reeds, you see globs of slime that were the creature's bones and organs just a moment ago. 
But the horse's skull remains, suspended in the mass of slime and seaweed, emitting what sounds like a man's malevolent laughter mixed with a horse's angered neighing.

>___
> 
> ***Adhesive.*** Anything touching the stallion adheres to it. A Large or smaller creature adhered to the stallion is also grappled by it (escape DC 17). Ability checks made to escape this grapple have disadvantage.
>
> ***Amphibious.*** The stallion can breathe air and water.
> 
> ***Charming Presence.*** When a creature starts its turn within 200 feet of the stallion, and they can both see each other, the stallioncan force it to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw, becoming charmed on a failure and dropping whatever it's holding. A creature charmed this way is incapacitated and spends each turn moving towards the nykur by the most direct route available in an attempt to mount it.   It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into dangerous terrain, such as lava or a pit, the target can repeat the saving throw. 
>
> A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. It has disadvantage on the save if the stallion is within line of sight; otherwise, it has advantage. If a target takes damage caused by the stallion, the charm ends. A target that breaks free of the charm is immune to this ability for the next 24 hours.  <br> A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see the stallion until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the stallion in the meantime, it must immediately make the save.
>
> ***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the stallion fails a saving throw, it
can choose to succeed instead.
>
> ***Unravel (Mythic Trait; Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the stallion is reduced to 0 hit points, it doesn't die or fall unconscious. Instead, it regains 136 hit points, and its body loses integrity, becoming jelly-like as masses of writhing seaweed spring out of it. Additionally, the range of all its attacks extend to 20 ft., it loses the use of its Change Shape and Charming Presence features, and the charmed condition on all creatures that it has charmed ends immediately.
>While in this state, the stallion has resistance to all damage not inflicted by cold iron weapons. 
If a holy symbol made of cold iron is adhered to its body, it loses this resistance. The stallion can use an action or an attack that's part of its Attack action to remove this symbol from its body unless it is held there by supernatural means other than its Adhesive ability.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The stallion makes two attacks; one with its hooves and one with its bite. In humanoid form, it makes two slam attacks.
> 
> ***Bite (Beast or True Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage.
>
> ***Hooves (Beast or True Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
> 
> ***Slam (Humanoid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage.
> 
> ***Suffocating Grasp.*** Each creature attached to the stallion and submerged in water must make a DC 17 Constitution save. On a failed save, a creature takes 33 (6d10) necrotic damage and starts to suffocate if it can't breathe water. On a pass, it takes half as much damage and does not begin suffocating.
> 
> ***Change Shape.*** The stallion polymorphs into a Large terrestrial beast or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies or is submerged in water.
> 
> ### Legendary Actions
> The stallion can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The stallion regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> **Check.** The stallion makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
>  **Flailing Hooves  (Beast or True Form Only).** The stallion makes one hooves attack with disadvantage.
>
> **Move.** The stallion moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
> 
> **Bite. (Costs 2 Actions).** The stallion makes one bite attack.
>
>
> **Reconstitute (Costs 3 Actions).** If the stallion is suffering from one or more conditions that require it to make a saving throw to end, it may immediately make a save against each condition, ending the condition on a success. The only saving throws that this action can be used for are saves made at the end or the start of its next turn or using its action. It can use this action while incapacitated.
>
> ### Mythic Actions
> If the stallion's Unravel trait is active, it can use 
the option below as a legendary action. 
>
> **Writhing Limbs** **(Costs 2 Actions).** The stallion makes an attack with its hooves against each creature within 20 feet of it. Each creature hit by an attack made this way must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled 20 feet directly toward the stallion.

# Wereass
Of all the lycanthropes to roam the world, none are so obnoxious as the wereass.  These braying jackasses refuse to take their world seriously, and they behave as though they are living in an inconsequential game.  While they are not as malicious or predatory as other lycanthropes, a wereass's penchant for chaos and tomfoolery often leads to it being despised by all who cross its path.  

Humanoids afflicted with this form of lycanthropy assume the aspects of a donkey.  In their fully humanoid form, their ears, nose, and mouth are slightly exaggerated, and their braying laughter grates the ears of everyone in their presence.  In their hybrid and donkey form, their hooves grant them a powerful kick, and they are fond of trampling others while they're down. 

Wereass's treat the world around them as though it's all a game with no consequences.  They are always searching for their next source of pleasure and amusement.  Theft, sabotage, and inciting chaos are some of a wereass's favorite hobbies.  A wereass will sometimes aid adventures in their quests if they seem interesting enough, though they make for unreliable allies at best.  Even if a wereass doesn't outright betray its party, it will still attempt to goad those around it into making chaotic and shortsighted choices.  Such suggestions from a wereass might include: 

"Why bargain with a merchant when you can steal?"  "Do we really need to return these items we were sent to retrieve?"  "Don't you think it would be funny if we mooned the king during his monologue?"  

Wereasses are incredibly stubborn, and when others call them out on their misbehavior, they double down and make even more of an ass of themselves.  Even when it looks like a wereass is losing in combat, its sheer stubbornness will kick in and make it all the more difficult to subdue.  Brass weapons are one of the few ways to cow a wereass, and they avoid incurring the wrath of individuals with such weapons.

Wereasses are always in search of kindred spirits, which are most often found amongst adventuring parties.  Wereasses gravitate towards individuals who have little regard for the consequences of the world they engage with.  They will stalk this fellow jackass, watching with amusement as the individual careens through their adventures with reckless abandon, failing to take anything seriously.   Once the individual is deemed worthy, the wereass will approach as an unassuming donkey until it is close enough to bite its target and pass on the curse.  

> ##### Player Characters as Wereasses
> The Monster Manual provides a general description of lycanthropy and how it effects player characters.  The following information applies specifically to wereasses.
The character gains a strength of 16 if their score is not already higher.  Attack and damage rolls for the hooves are based on Strength.  For the Trampling Charge trait, the DC is 8 + the character's proficiency bonus + Strength modifier.

## Werewolves
These savage predators are the most common and notorious of all lycanthropes. By day, they are aggressive and hot-tempered humanoids with a penchant for rare meat and an affinity for canines. When their tranformation takes place, they either turn into large, bloodthirsty wolves or terrifying wolf-human hybrids, with lupine heads and fur on a vaguely bipedal humanoid body complete with long arms and slashing claws. Though their paw-hands in this form are capable of manipulating objects and wielding weapons, werewolves much prefer slashing apart their prey with their iron-hard claws. 

Their lycanthropic resilience also makes them almost impossible to kill. Outside of silvered weapons, the only known means of reliably slaying werewolves is through the use of powerful soundwaves which damage their sensitive lupine hearing.



***Ravagers of Civilization.***
Most who contract werewolf lycanthropy withdraw from civilization. Even those who embrace their curse and care nothing for the harm they cause know they can't maintain their guise among other humanoids for long because, when a werewolf's transformation occurs, it becomes the anathema of all things civilized. The veneer of principles and rationality melt away, and primal instincts take over. The overriding emotion werewolves often feel is rage towards the civilized society that keeps them chained beneath the surface for the majority of their life. As such, werewolves often prioritize hunting other humanoids as a way of exacting their vengeance on the shackles of civilization. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some humanoids embrace this hatred and actively seek to tear down civilization even when in their humanoid form. Others fight against it, trying to maintain their guise of civility, which only serves to fuel the fury of the wolf within. Others find a way to make peace with their inner beast, and while still savage at heart, they are able to channel their ferocity in a way that minimizes harm to other innocent sentient creatures.

***Pack Hunters and Lone Wolves.*** The wolf's tendency to run in packs carries over to werewolves, who often form hunting groups in the wild to better catch particularly dangerous or evasive prey. These werewolf packs utilize many of the same techniques as wolves: silently stalking prey, launching ambushes designed to frighten their victims into fleeing, and isolating targets for coordinated takedowns. These hunts are usually led by a powerful pack leader who picks out the target and coordinates the werewolves' attacks against that victim, ensuring a bloody kill. 

Other werewolves live a more solitary life, shunning the company of their kind. This might be done out of rejection of their curse, because they don't wish to share their kills, or because they work with other non-lupine creatures. Though this isolation helps lone werewolves become more dangerous in isolation than those accustomed to working with a pack, they lack the ability to utilize the pack tactics of their more sociable kin.

### Werewolf Moon Mystics

All werewolves feel a primal connection to the moon and the urge to unleash their bestial impulses follows its phases. Some introspective werewolves study and meditate upon this connection, plumbing the depths of their primal psyche and how it intertwines with the moon's phases. This path not only helps these werewolves to better temper and regulate their reckless bloodthirst, but allows them to channel lunar power through their body. 

These werewolves come to be known as moon mystics, and they are known for the serene grace with which they take on their lupine aspect and are even better known for their ability to dispatch foes with magical blasts of moonlight. The restraint moon mystics are capable of allows them to avoid diving right into the fray and target dangerous foes from a distance with their lunar bolts and burning moonbeams. 

The ascetic nature of these werewolves means they rarely participate in hunts with others of their kind and often live as contemplative hermits. However, when moon mystics do join or interact with werewolf packs, they often serve as spiritual leaders. Some mystics temper the aggression of their kin, but others will warp the social dynamic of their pack, giving it a cult-like dynamic as they lead disturbing rituals designed to pursue inscrutable goals.

> ***Multiattack.*** The werewolf makes two attacks, only one of which can be a bite attack.
>
> ***Bite (Wolf or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with werewolf lycanthropy.
>
>***Claws. (Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) radiant damage.
>
> ***Lunar Bolt. (3/Day)*** *Ranged Spell attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) radiant damage and moonlight illuminates the target until the end of the werewolf's next turn. While illuminated this way, the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack roll against an affected target has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected target can't benefit from being invisible.
>
> ***Searing Moonlight. (1/Day)*** A pale beam of moonlight appears and fills a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 120 of the werewolf. The cylinder lasts as long as the werewolf maintains concentration on it, up to a minute (as if concentrating on a spell). The area of the cylinder is considered dimly lit. Any non-shapechanger that is caught in the area of the moonbeam when it first appears or that ends its turn within the moonbeam must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. It takes 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While maintaining concentration on this ability, the werewolf can use its bonus action to move the beam 30 feet in any direction.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Shapechanger.*** The werewolf polymorphs into wolf-humanoid hybrid or into a wolf, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics are the same in each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

## Wolves
These majestic and deadly hunters roam many of the world’s forests and tundras, using their brutally effective pack-hunting tactics to fell much larger and more dangerous animals. Wolves strike fear in the hearts of humanoids who venture too far into the wilds, and their notoriety has earned them a place as common monsters and villains in many fables and children’s tales. The sounds of distant howling will alert travelers that they are entering wolf territory, and few do so willingly unless traveling in a well-armed group. Any travelers who become lost and isolated in the woods will have little hope of survival should a pack of wolves pick up their scent.

***Master Pack Hunters.*** 
Those who catch the attention of a wolf pack will often be oblivious to their peril as the pack silently stalks its prey, slowly closing in until they are noticed. Once the pack is spotted, it will close in and attempt to drive its prey into fleeing. Sufficiently powerful prey that stands its ground and proves intimidating enough may be able to drive the wolves away. Wolves that press the attack will attempt to separate the weakest-looking target from its companions and drag it to the ground, where it can be subdued with vicious bites. Even if the prey manages to flee, the wolves will relentlessly pursue it until they are able to surround and slaughter their victim.

&emsp; ***Fiercely Loyal Allies.*** The group dynamics and hunting strategies of wolves are similar enough to most <br> humanoids that they are often able to integrate <br> themselves into tribes living far from civilization. These wolves might live amongst druidic circles, barbarian <br> tribes to the north, orcish warbands, or goblinoid <br> warrens. Regardless of the group, the wolf's instinct <br> toward teamwork and loyalty to hierarchical packs leaves <br> it well suited to many vital roles. Wolves will serve their adopted families as sentries, hunters, and war beasts in combat. They are adept at following verbal and somatic instructions from their humanoid companions to <br> coordinate their efforts.

***Dire Wolves.*** These primeval wolves are a more <br> primitive and savage version of their modern kin. They are more often found in wilder regions that have remained untouched by civilization. Here, they prey on large game <br> as well as any humanoids attempting to eke out an <br> existence in the unforgiving wilds. Like ordinary wolves, <br> dire wolves are prized allies amongst any humanoids able <br> to humanoids able to tame or befriend them, though this <br> is a difficult and dangerous prospect for any without <br> druidic abilities. As dire wolves are often favored by gods <br> of winter or the hunt, they may also be sent to aid those <br> who curry the favor of such gods. Though, just are just as likely to be sent to hunt and devour those who displease <br> the gods by daring to challenge the might of the wilds.

### Ascendant Packleader


Wolves blend ferocity, beauty, and teamwork in such a way that many humanoids regard them with a sense of awe that borders on reverence. As such, they are a favored animal among many celestial beings and a common form for sacred beasts to assume. Ascendant packleaders are a form of divine wolf created to lead wolf packs on the Material Plane in service of a higher purpose. They may have once been ordinary wolves elevated to divine status or celestials who took on a lupine form when they entered the Material Plane. 

Once an ascendant packleader has taken command of a wolf pack, it leads its lupine brethren with supernatural efficiency. Packleaders can bark orders at their pack mates, enabling them to perform complex tactical maneuvers normally beyond the capabilities of such creatures, and their supernatural howls can break the resolve of prey while driving their allies to victory. 

Using these powers of command, the ascendant packleader also drives its pack to pursue higher-level goals normally beyond the comprehension of ordinary wolves. These goals may simply be to protect a sacred wood, or they may involve furthering large-scale agendas in service of a god or other divine being. The nature of these goals and the packleaders pursuing them are as varied as the gods they serve. Noble packleaders act in service to gods seeking to protect the sanctity of life and nature, while brutal packleaders sent by wicked gods of the wilds take cruel pleasure in hunting humanoids and undoing the works of civilization.

>
> &#8226; If the creature is suffering an effect that requires it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its next turn, it immediately makes that save.

# Yule cat
Stalking villages in harsh winter environments, the yule cat strikes terror into the hearts of those who would skirt their responsibilities near the holiday season. The monster appears to be a typical fluffy cat, except it is roughly the size of a polar bear. Its yellow eyes glow with fiendish malice, betraying its unnatural origin, and its teeth and claws are capable of ripping through villagers with ease. 

***Hunters of the Indolent.*** Yule cats primarily stalk towns in cold, harsh environments, usually as significant holiday events approach. The yule cat will look for villagers with a specific identifier that indicates they have shirked their duties that year. The most common identifier is someone lacking new clothes, as this implies the individual didn't adequately aid the community in preparing clothes for the coming winter. 

However, these identifiers can vary depending on the traditions and economic exports of the village. In a town known for crafting and trading jewelry to survive, the yule cat may instead target villagers without any form of newly crafted jewelry on their person. Whatever the indicator, the yule cat will ruthlessly hunt and kill these individuals, whether men, women, or children.

***Winter Stalkers of Unknown Origin.***
While yule cats are fiendish in nature, their origins are not wholly known. Some claim they are the pets of mountain-dwelling hags and giants sent to torment lazy humanoids. Others believe them to be divine punishment resulting from villagers not doing their part to help the community in times of hardship.

Regardless of their origin, yule cats invariably roam wintery environments using feline hunting methods to prey upon their targeted villagers. Despite their large size, yule cats can easily blend into snowy landscapes, even hiding within snow flurries with supernatural ease. Victims will often be within pouncing range before they notice the fiend, even while within the supposed safety of their village.

If a yule cat's victim notices it and attempts to escape, the fiend can freeze its target in place with a dreadful glare.  Once its prey is paralyzed, the yule cat will take its time tormenting and playing with its soon-to-be meal.  Some yule cats will even allow their prey the illusion of escape just before making the killing strike.

##### Yule Cat Adventurers
| d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | A town's citizens have become indolent, falling behind on producing needed clothes for the coming winter.  A town elder has summoned the yule cat to teach the population a harsh lesson.|
|  2  | A hag gives out clothes to poor children living in rags.  The children who refuse her gifts and continue wearing their rags are hunted by her pet yule cat.   |
|  3  | A sadistic and fashion-obsessed bard has gained control of a yule cat.  Townsfolk who fail to keep up with the latest clothing trends are hunted by the beast. |
|  4  | A yule cat is the favored pet of a vain cloud giant who lords over a dwarven mining village.  Dwarves who don't adorn themselves with newly mined gems each year are hunted by the cat.  |
|  5  |A village regularly wracked by storms must repair its homes each year.  The yule cat destroys any home left in disrepair and devours its inhabitants.  |
|  6  | A toymaker has devised a way to ensure his employees stay focused on making enough goods for the coming holiday: workers who fail to meet their quotas are hunted by a yule cat. |

> ***Keen Sight.*** The yule cat has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ***Holiday Clothing.*** The yule cat treats creatures wearing new clothing they've received within the last month as though they are under the effects of the *protection from evil and good* spell.
>
> ***Pounce.*** If the yule cat jumps at least 10 feet straight towards a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
>
> ***Snow Stalker.*** The yule cat has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in snowy terrain and can do so even if it is only lightly obscured while in such terrain.
>
> ***Snow Strider.*** The yule cat ignores difficult terrain and slipping hazards caused by ice and snow.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The yule cat makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the yule cat can't attack another target.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 24 (4d8 + 6) piercing damage.  If the target is prone, it takes 42 (8d8 + 6) piercing damage instead.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit*: 19 (2d12 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Winter's Gaze.*** The yule cat targets one creature it can see within 100 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute unless it is wearing new clothing it received within the last month. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the target's saving throw is successful, or if the effect ends on it, the target is immune to the Winter's Gaze of all yule cats for 1 hour.

> ##### Beyond Simple Clothing
> The Holiday Clothing and Winter's Gaze features are built around the assumption you are running a traditional Yule Cat from Islandic folklore that hunts individuals based on their clothing.  This legend is likely rooted in the fact that clothing production was a vital aspect of daily life for the Islandic villages where this tale originated.  You can modify these abilities to focus on a different feature that better suits the primary industry or customs of the town being terrified by the yule cat.  The primary theme of the yule cat is that it hunts those who have not done their part for the village.  You can adapt it to identify these individuals in a way that makes the most sense for your setting.
