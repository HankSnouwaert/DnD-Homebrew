## The Lion Tyrant  <br> (Player Level: 5-7)
The players learn that a fiendbound lion has taken over a local lion pride. They must work with a noble, oathsworn lion to displace the usurping tyrant and restore harmony to the land.

### Lead Up
The oathsworn lion will insist on fighting the fiendpact lion in one-on-one combat to properly claim dominance over the pride. There are two primary ways the players can approach this encounter, which the lion will explain to them. The players can help the oathsworn lion in its fight with the fiendbound lion, but they will not be as greatly rewarded. (NOTE: What does the last sentence mean?)

#### Approach 1: Formal Challenge
The oathbound lion and the party make their presence known as the lion challenges the fiendpact lion to a duel. The fiendpack lion will accept the challenge, allowing the oathbound lion to come to the plateau of the rock, at which point the fiendpact lion will break its word and have the hyenas help it take down the oathbound lion.

#### Approach 2: All-Out Attack
The players can launch an immediate full-out attack. In this scenario, the oathsworn lion will still insist on fighting the fiendpact lion one-on-one and will ask the players to clear the path of hyenas and ensure no one interferes with the fight.

### The Trees
The encounter map features large 20-foot tall trees that can be climbed with a successful DC 14 Athletics check outlined on the map.) Creatures with a climb speed that are within 5 feet of the trunk don't need to make a check. Creatures in a tree have half cover and are lightly obscured. Each tree trunk has 50 hit points, an AC of 15, immunity to psychic damage, and resistance to bludgeoning and piercing damage. If a tree is destroyed, any creatures in the tree immediately fall out.

### The Wildfire
On initiative count 1 of the first turn of combat, multiple lightning bolts will strike the area, starting wildfires that spread quickly. On initiative count 1 of each subsequent turn, any creature that ends its turn in the grasslands will take 2d8 fire damage. Once the fiendpack lion is defeated, a rainstorm will extinguish the fire.

### NPC Actions During The Encounter
&emsp;**Oathsworn Lion:** His main goal is to fight the fiendpact lion by himself.

**Fiendpact Lion:** He has no intention of fighting fairly and will avoid one-on-one combat by any means. His thirst for power has driven him mad, and he will not flee even if he is badly wounded.

**Hyenas:** The hyenas will attempt to aid the fiendpact lion when they can but will not take unnecessary risks. They will not take opportunity attacks from opponents to aid the lion or move through hazardous terrain. Two hyena reinforcements will arrive on initiative count 1 of each turn, acting at designated locations on the map. Once the fiendpact dies, the hyenas will flee.

\pagebreakNum

**Lions:** The lionesses of the pride respect a code of honor and will stay neutral until they see that the fiendpact lion is not fighting fairly. At that point, they will join the players to help defend the oathsworn lion. If the players harm any lionesses or attempt to aid the oathsworn lion in its fight before the fiendpact lion cheats, the lionesses will join in on the side of the hyenas.

### Option Rules: Simplified Combat For Lionesses & Hyenas
If a lioness can reach a hyena, it deals 10 damage to the hyena. If the lioness would have advantage on its attack or can pounce, it deals 20 damage and grapples the hyena.

If a hyena can reach a lioness, it deals 5 damage. If the hyena would have advantage on its attack, it deals 10 damage.

If a giant hyena can reach a lioness, it deals 16 damage. If the hyena would have advantage on its attack, it deals 7 damage.

If a giant hyena can reach a lioness, it deals 20 damage. If the hyena would have advantage on its attack, it deals 10 damage. (NOTE: Duplicate and numbers don't seem right.)

### Aftermath
The fiendpact lion will fight to the death, but once he dies, the remainder of the hyenas will quickly flee. The oathsworn lion will also fight to the death, as will the lionesses. If the players flee and the oathsworn lion has been defeated, the hyenas will be sent to pursue them.

### Loot 
As this is likely a climactic battle as part of a larger story, it would make sense to award the players at least part of a treasure hoard of the appropriate level from the DMG. The wealth could be awarded to them by the oathsworn lion in the form of sacred items the lion pride has accrued or items they've taken from invading forces.

#### XP Award
The degree of success the players have in overthrowing the fiendpact lion can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** The fiendpact lion is defeated without the players attacking him directly (the oathsworn defeats him.)
* **100% XP:** The fiendpact lion is defeated but the players directly intervene in the duel by providing direct aid to the oathsworn lion or hindering the fiendpact lion.
* **50% XP:** The fiendpact lion is defeated but the players did most of the work in defeating him, or the oathsworn lion was defeated himself.
* **10% XP:** The players flee the encounter with the fiendpact lion still in power.

### Adjusting the Difficulty

* XP Award: 1,500 XP

### Adventure Lead Ups
If you're looking for ways you can lead the players to this climatic battle, the following hooks can provide inspiration as to how to set this up as part of a larger adventure.

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**Hyena Ambush:** While traveling through the savanna, the players are ambushed by a pack of hyenas. After defeating or escaping them, they find clues pointing towards the fiendpact lion's influence and the need to aid the oathsworn lion in reclaiming his pride. |
|  2  | **Mystic's Vision:** A traveling mystic or seer visits the players with a vision of a great battle between two powerful lions, one dark and one light. The mystic believes this battle will decide the fate of the savanna and implores the players to seek out the noble, oathsworn lion and assist in this struggle.  |
|  3  | **Hyena Infestation:** The players are hired by a nearby village to deal with an infestation of aggressive hyenas. During their mission, they uncover that these hyenas are under the command of the fiendpact lion, leading them to the broader conflict with the oathsworn lion. |
|  4  | **Desecrated Shrine:** The players come across a desecrated shrine dedicated to the spirits of the savanna. Restoring the shrine grants them the favor of the spirits, who reveal the dire situation between the fiendpact and oathsworn lions and ask for the playersâ€™ intervention. |

A target creature that the hyena can see within 60 feet of it and that can hear the hyena must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the end of the hyena's next turn. While frightened, the creature's speed is 0 and it can't cast spells other than cantrips. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more, it is also paralyzed until the fear ends. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

\pagebreakNum

#### Fiendpact Lion Tactics
Fiendpact lion avoid fights whenever possible unless they have a significant advantage. If forced into a fight, their primary strategy is to use their Repelling Claw and Whispers of Doubt to isolate a creature, gaining advantage on all attacks against it. These lions will sacrifice any minions they have to gain hit points from their Dark One's Blessing.

#### Oathsworn Lion Tactics
These lions position themselves at the center of combat, allowing allies to benefit from their aura. They will single out the biggest threat using their Champion Challenge while their allies handle other threats in the area.


> ##### New Condition: Obsessed
> The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

On a failed save, the creature and the lion are obsessed with each other for one minute. While the lion is obsessed, it has advantage on attack rolls. The obsession ends if a creature friendly to the lion damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if the lion ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
