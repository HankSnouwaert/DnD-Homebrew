## Deer 
Existing across a vast range of environments in many forms, deer stand out as creatures of elegance, adaptability, and resilience. These graceful beings, ranging from the diminutive and sprightly to the majestic and formidable, embody a blend of agility, strength, and vigilance. 

Deer are also embodiments of agility and sensory acuity. Their lithe forms navigate the densest woods and roughest terrains with effortless grace. Keen senses — acute hearing and a robust sense of smell — keep them ever alert to potential threats, and their threats are many, for deer are often the favored prey of the many predators they share their homes with, from wolves to bears to humanoid hunters. 

Deer are such common prey that, for many humanoid cultures, they've come to be seen as symbols of the hunt. The stamina and endurance of these creatures are legendary. Capable of sustaining high-speed chases across vast distances, deer exhibit a remarkable blend of speed and endurance, qualities that have inspired countless tales and legends throughout the ages of great hunters pursuing particularly elusive deer.

However, deer are far from helpless prey. Adorned with impressive antlers, a hallmark of their kind, the male deer (and some females, depending on species) exhibit a natural prowess in their horned charge. These antlers, far from mere ornaments of courtship, serve as formidable weapons in territorial disputes and self-defense. The deer's charge, a spectacular display of speed and strength, showcases their ability to confront challenges head-on.

Should deer find themselves retreating from attackers, they can utilize their hardened hoofs to deliver a powerful back-kick. This swift and unexpected maneuver enables them to fend off predators and threats even in retreat. The deer's muscular hind legs, engineered for both fleet-footed escapes and potent defense, make them creatures not to be underestimated.

The following are examples of different types of deer across a variety of sizes and power levels. Though it's not a comprehensive list of every type of deer, most other types could still be represented using the stat block of one of the deer presented here.

### Pudus

These diminutive beings inhabit a diverse range of forest environments, highlighting their adaptability and resilience. The pudu's most distinctive characteristic is its size. Standing at just 14 to 18 inches at the shoulder, they are incredibly small for deer. Their fur, which ranges in color from reddish-brown to dark brown, thickens and darkens during colder periods, providing effective camouflage in dense forest habitats. Male pudus are particularly noted for their small, spiked antlers, which grow up to 4 inches in length and are shed annually.

In terms of behavior, pudus are herbivorous, feeding primarily on leaves, twigs, bark, buds, fruit, and flowers. They demonstrate remarkable agility, often standing on their hind legs to reach higher foliage and using their front legs to pull branches closer. Adapted to life in dense underbrush and thickets, their small size allows them to navigate these environments with ease. These creatures are typically solitary and elusive, making them a rare and intriguing sight. Much of their rarity stems from their solitary lives. Pudus only come together for mating, and their fawns are born with white spots for camouflage, which they lose as they grow older.

Survival for pudus involves a blend of agility and instinct. They are adept at escaping predators, using rapid, zig-zag running patterns and their ability to swim. These tactics are a testament to their adaptability and resilience in the wild, which belies their small and seemingly helpless appearance.

### Fallow Deer
These deer are as elegant as they are adaptable and grace many landscapes with their presence. Fallow deer can be identified by their impressive antlers and distinctive coats, which are particularly striking, exhibiting a range of colors from light tan with white mottling to dark chocolate brown and sometimes even pure white. The males boast large, unique antlers that are broad and shovel-like, a feature that distinguishes them from other deer species. These antlers are a significant part of their identity, shed and regrown annually.

Fallow deer often form herds, which can be quite large in areas with few natural predators or in protected environments. Their diet primarily consists of grasses, herbs, and leaves, with grazing typically occurring at dawn and dusk. During mating season, males engage in displays of strength and dominance to attract females. This involves intense vocalizations and physical confrontations, a dramatic display of natural behaviors.

### Caribou
With their distinctive antlers and hardy nature, these animals epitomize the resilience and majesty of life in the harsh northern climates. Caribou are large deer, notable for both males and females possessing antlers, a unique trait among deer species. These antlers are grand and intricate, used for foraging in the snow and as a display during mating seasons. The coat of a caribou is dense and weather-resistant, varying in color but typically exhibiting shades of brown, gray, and white, providing excellent insulation and camouflage in their natural habitats.

Socially, caribou are known for their migratory habits, often traveling in large herds across vast distances. This migration is a spectacular sight and is driven by their search for food, mating opportunities, and calving grounds. Caribou diets are versatile, feeding on a variety of vegetation, including lichens, known as reindeer moss, grasses, and leaves, adapting their diet to the changing seasons.

The breeding season for caribou is a time of heightened activity. Males compete for females through displays of antler size and strength. They generally only give birth to a single calf at a time, and these calves grow quickly, a necessity for survival in the often harsh conditions of their habitats.

In terms of survival strategies, caribou are well-equipped for life in the challenging north. Their large, wide hooves are adapted for walking on snow and soft ground, acting like natural snowshoes. They are also excellent swimmers, an ability that aids them in crossing large rivers and lakes during their migrations.

Caribou play a significant role in their ecosystems. Their migration patterns and grazing habits have profound effects on the vegetation and overall health of the landscapes they traverse. Many northern tribes and civilizations use caribou as herd animals that are vital to their survival in the resource scarce north. As such, caribou come to hold major cultural significance and are featured in many legends and folktales of these peoples.

### Elk 
Known for their impressive stature and striking antlers, elk are among the largest species of deer, with males significantly larger than females. They are distinguished by their impressive antlers, which are some of the largest of any deer species, with a complex, branching structure. These antlers, shed annually, are not just a symbol of their strength but also play a crucial role during the mating season. The elk's thick coat changes from a light tan in summer to a darker brown in winter, providing  camouflage and insulation.

Elk are known for their herd behavior. While females and young typically form large herds, males may either join these herds or form smaller groups of their own. These herds are dynamic and can change in size and composition with the seasons. Elks' diet is predominantly grass-based, but they also feed on leaves, bark, and shrubs, showing adaptability in their feeding habits to suit the environment.

During mating season, bulls engage in dramatic displays of strength and dominance to attract mates, including bugling, a loud series of vocalizations, and displaying their antlers. Calves are born with spotted coats for camouflage, a critical survival trait in their early days.

### Moose
The moose is the largest and most imposing of the <br> modern deer. With their towering stature and <br> distinctive antlers, moose command an imposing <br> presence in the landscapes they inhabit.

Moose are remarkable for their size, with males <br> being significantly larger than females. One of the <br> most striking features of the moose is its antlers, <br> which are the largest of any deer species. These <br> antlers, exclusive to males, spread impressively <br> wide and are shed annually. The moose's coat, thick <br> and coarse, varies in color from brown to black, <br> offering insulation against the cold climates they <br> often inhabit.

Moose are mostly solitary, except during the <br> mating season or when mothers are raising their <br> young. They wander alone through vast northern <br> territories, relying on their size rather than a herd <br> to protect them from predators. Moose are <br> herbivores, feeding on a diet rich in both aquatic <br> and terrestrial vegetation, including leaves, bark, <br> pine cones, twigs, and shoots. 

During mating season, male moose engage in <br> fierce competitions for the attention of females, <br> often involving physical displays and antler clashes. <br> Their calves grow rapidly, as size is a necessary <br> part of their survival strategy against the harsh <br> conditions and fierce predators they must endure.

Once they are fully grown, moose can rely on <br> their size and strength to fend off threats. Their <br> large antlers serve as a deterrent to predators, <br> and their long legs are capable of powerful kicks. <br> Moose are also excellent swimmers, an ability that <br> aids them in foraging for aquatic plants and <br> escaping predators.

As some of the most imposing creatures of their <br> northern habits, moose are often utlized as prized <br> guardians and steeds by druids. Moose are typically <br> not trainable by mundane means, and only those <br> with a supernatural connection to the wild can hope <br> to leverage the mighty strength of these majestic <br> creatures.

### Megaloceros
These primeval deer dwell in remote time-lost tundras alongside other ancient megafauna. Megaloceros are one of the largest deer species to have ever lived, with males displaying a remarkable set of antlers, some of the largest in any deer species, both in width and length. These antlers, which can span up to 12 feet from tip to tip, are not only a display of dominance but a tool used in mating rituals and defense against predators. Their robust and muscular bodies are covered in a thick coat of fur that varies in color, aiding them in adapting to colder climates.

The social and breeding behaviors of the megaloceros are similar to those of other deer, with males vying with each other during mating season. The males use their impressive antlers to gain the attention of females and to establish dominance within their herds. These antlers also serve as a menecing warning to any who would threaten the herd.

Survival for megaloceros, given their size and habitat, involves a blend of sheer physical presence, speed, and honed senses. Their large antlers, while majestic, can present navigational challenges, particularly in maneuvering dense forests. As a result, megaloceros prefer to roam open grassy landscapes where they can leverage their size and speed.

### Ice Caribou

Deep within the frozen tundra, herds of large, pristine white caribou roam across icy fields. These magnificent creatures are distinguished by their elaborate horns crafted from pure ice, and their legs end in hooves covered in frost.

***Frost Feeders.*** In areas devoid of the hardiest vegetation, these caribou have adapted a unique diet. They appear to draw sustenance directly from the cold, feeding on fragments of glaciers and ice scattered across their habitat. Should a caribou wander into warmer regions, it risks withering and starvation due to the absence of its icy diet.

***Icy Antlers.*** The ice caribou have the extraordinary ability to rapidly grow their antlers at a moment's notice. In mere seconds, a bare-headed caribou can develop a full set of imposing, icy antlers, ready for battle. These antlers, while large and intimidating, can shatter easily upon strong impact, releasing a burst of freezing ice. This not only serves as a defense mechanism but also plays a crucial role in the males' combative displays during mating rituals. In these fierce duels, stags often break many sets of antlers against one another until one is left standing victorious.

***Icy Alliances.*** Ice caribou are far more intelligent than typical deer, and druids and fey have the ability to communicate with them, allowing for the formation of basic alliances. These typically involve agreements like safe passage through caribou territories or exchanging information about recent visitors to their icy realms. In some rare cases, more powerful beings like ice hags or arctic druids have managed to enlist herds of these caribou for more significant tasks, such as pulling enchanted sleds or serving as formidable guards against unwanted intruders.

> ***Ice Antlers.*** At the end of the caribou's turn, a pair of large ice antlers grow from its head. The caribou loses these antlers if it takes 5 or more fire damage from a single source.
>
> ***Ice Walk.*** The caribou can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make ability checks. Icy surfaces can't cause it to fall prone. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra movement.
>
> ***Shattering Charge.*** If the caribou moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and then hits it with a Gore attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the caribou has ice antlers, they shatter after the attack, even if it misses. The target and each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) cold damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful save.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage. If it has ice antlers, it deals 19 (4d6 + 5) piercing damage instead.
>
> ***Frost Hooves.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) cold damage. If the target is a creature, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the caribou's next turn.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Back Kick.*** If a creature makes an opportunity attack against the caribou, the caribou may make a Frost Hooves attack against the creature with disadvantage after the attack.

### Cosmic Caribou
In the realm above, the cosmic caribou roam, creatures born of myth and cosmic light. Their bodies shimmer like the auroras, casting vibrant hues as they glide through the heavens. These reindeer, moving in majestic herds or guiding the sleighs of shamans, embody the celestial dance of the cosmos. Their ethereal presence in the night sky is often linked to the unfolding of cosmic events, making them a mesmerizing spectacle for the fortunate few who witness their journey.

These caribou are more than celestial wonders; they are bearers of destiny. Legend holds that they appear to guide heroes and sages, transporting them across mystical landscapes.  Their arrival is seen as an omen, often signaling the start of epic quests or pivotal moments in the world's fate. Endowed with ancient wisdom, the cosmic caribou are sought after for their insight into the intricate weave of destiny and time.

However, their existence is a delicate balance. The cosmic caribou's wellbeing is believed to mirror the universe's equilibrium. Their demise, often sought by malevolent forces, is seen as a harbinger of great calamity, potentially leading to chaos and darkness. Thus, many cultures revere and protect these creatures, recognizing their role in maintaining the cosmic harmony and the balance of the universe.

### Deer Tactics
Most deer, from tiny pudus to supernatural caribou, generally don't seek out combat as they are herbivores. If there is some supernatural compulsion driving them to attack, they will utilize hit-and-run tactics. They charge in with their horns before running out of reach to repeat the process on their next turn, using their Back Kick against anyone who makes an opportunity attack against them.

#### Ice Caribou
These creatures will focus on bringing down anyone capable of dealing fire damage. Their ice attacks help enable their hit-and-run tactics by slowing down their targets.

### Deer Loot
The valuable items looted from deer will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Most of an ice caribou's form will melt away when it is destroyed. Players can loot the insolvable bits of ice and melt water it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Deer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
