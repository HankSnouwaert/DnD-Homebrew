## Apes
### Chimpazees
These nearly humanoid apes dwell in tropical forests and savannas and are known for being among the most intelligent creatures in the animal kingdom. Adult chimpanzees stand up to 4 feet high and weigh as much as 70 kg (154 lbs) in the wild, although males are typically larger and more muscular than females. They are covered in coarse black hair, except for the face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. They possess long arms that are ideal for climbing trees, where they can spend a large part of their lives. Despite being quadrupeds, chimpanzees can walk upright on two legs for a short distance. They have opposable thumbs and big toes, which allows them to grasp objects and use tools.

 Chimpanzees display impressive cognitive abilities. They have demonstrated an understanding of symbols and can learn sign language to communicate with humanoids, develop basic tools, and employ complex problem-solving techniques.

They live in complex social structures, known as communities, which can consist of dozens of members. Social interaction among chimpanzees includes a range of behaviors such as cooperation, competition, alliances, and even warfare with other groups. Adventures and explorers must take care they don’t find themselves targeted by such aggression, for chimpanzees are much stronger and deadly than their size belies, capable of tearing apart foes with their bare hands and teeth.

### Gibbons

Gibbons are small apes that dwell among the trees of dense rainforests. They are smaller than other apes, weighing between 10-20 pounds, though their arm spans can reach up to 5 feet. These long arms are used for their unique form of locomotion known as brachiation. They swing from branch to branch for distances of up to 50 feet at speeds as high as 35 mph. Their long arms and hook-like hands allow them to move through the trees with agility and speed, rarely coming to the ground. Although they spend most of their time in the trees, when they do come to the ground, they can walk on two feet (bipedal), often using their arms for balance.

Gibbons are well known for their loud and complex vocalizations, often referred to as "songs" which can be heard up to 2 miles away. These songs are used to communicate various things, such as marking territory, warning of predators, or attracting mates. Gibbons and their songs are often incorporated into the myths and stories of jungle-dwelling humanoids who live alongside them. Some humanoids even befriend gibbons, providing them protection in exchange for their aid as scouts and sentries among the trees.

### Gorillas
Gorillas are among the largest known primates. Adult male gorillas, known as "silverbacks" due to the characteristic patch of silver hair on their backs and hips, can stand up to 5.6 feet tall in the wild and weigh up to 400 pounds. Gorillas dwell in tropical forests, many of which are in mountainous terrain. 

They live in groups known as troops, typically composed of one dominant silverback, several adult females, and their offspring. The dominant silverback makes decisions like where to forage and make nesting sites.

Gorillas are extremely strong, with the ability to lift and carry almost twice their body weight. Despite their size and strength, gorillas are also quite agile and can climb trees when needed. However, gorillas are primarily terrestrial and move around by a form of locomotion called knuckle-walking, where they support their weight on the backs of their curved fingers rather than their palms. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



Despite their size and strength, gorillas are typically gentle and shy. They can, however, be fierce and extremely formidable when they feel threatened or when the safety of their group, especially the infants, is in jeopardy. Gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a variety of plants, leaves, stems, roots, vines, and fruits. Some species consume small invertebrates, but hunting for larger creatures is unheard of. Conflicts with explorers and adventurers arise when they stumble into gorilla territory and appear to pose a threat or when something is amiss in the environment that is agitating the gorillas and driving them to higher levels of aggression.

### Giant Apes
Giant apes, sometimes called dire gorillas, are colossal, sentient primates and a beacon of fear and respect throughout their wild homelands. These enormous beasts dwarf their mundane cousins, standing up to 20 feet tall and weighing as much as 2,000 pounds. Their hide is a rugged canvas of thick fur ranging from dark brown to pitch black, and their piercing eyes hold an eerie intelligence that betrays their brutish appearance.

Giant apes possess a strength unparalleled in the natural world, a trait that they use to protect their territory and kin fiercely. Despite their terrifying strength, they exhibit an unexpected grace, moving silently through their surroundings, their giant forms blending into the shadows of the forests and mountains they call home.

While generally peaceful, they become fearsome opponents when their kin or territory is threatened, capable of causing devastation with their bare hands.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


 Giant apes rarely tolerate dangerous predators in their territory and often clash with other mighty beasts as they work to keep their home secure. A group of giant apes driven to a rampage by an overwhelming number of threats to their home is a force to be reckoned with and one deeply feared by other jungle-dwelling creatures. 

Giant apes are considered sacred by many cultures, seen as guardians of nature, and are often central in local folklore and myths. Many adventuring parties seek them out, drawn by tales of their immense power and majesty. However, those who approach with ill intent or disrespect are met with the full force of a giant ape’s wrath, a sight few live to recount.

### Jufu
In the jagged peaks and deep valleys of the mountainous regions, where the terrain is harsh and unforgiving, resides a unique species of ape known as the Jufu. They are a hardy breed, remarkably adapted to their elevated environment. About the size of an average chimp, the Jufu's physique belies their impressive strength and skill.

Jufus have a distinctive feature that sets them apart from their primate relatives - their unusually powerful arms and broad hands. This physical trait, paired with their keen vision, makes them exceptional throwers. These apes have an uncanny knack for hurling stones with remarkable precision and deadly force, a skill that has earned them a formidable reputation.

This talent is not merely a method of hunting, but an essential part of their survival strategy. When hunting, Jufus gather at vantage points high above their prey, pelting them with a barrage of rocks. The stunned or injured prey provides an easy meal for these clever hunters.
This stone-throwing ability also serves as a crucial defensive strategy. Intruders venturing into their territory are greeted by a rain of stones from the heights, making Jufus particularly effective at driving off larger predators or rival clans. This ability has earned them an aura of respect, and even fear, amongst other creatures who share their mountainous home.

In the folklore of nearby human settlements, Jufus are often depicted as guardians of the mountains, with their stone-throwing seen as a mystical ability to control the elements. Tales are told of lost travelers guided to safety by the path of stones thrown by a Jufu, or of invading forces deterred by a storm of rocks from the mountain apes.

### Titanic Apes
Titanic Apes are mythical creatures whispered of in hushed reverence among scholars and adventurers alike. Standing at staggering heights up to 100 feet, titanic apes dwarf most humanoid structures. Their bodies are powerfully built, covered in thick fur that ranges from jet black to silver-gray. Their eyes glow with an almost human-like intelligence, and an undeniable, primal ferocity.

Their strength is the stuff of legends, said to be capable of shattering buildings and sweeping away scores of puny humanoid warriors with a mere sweep of their enormous arms. Despite their colossal size, these behemoths move with surprising agility, traversing dense forests, scaling mountainous terrain, and even swimming across vast oceanic stretches.

Yet, they are not mere beasts of brute force. Titanic apes possess a profound wisdom and understanding of the world. Their low, rumbling vocalizations, akin to the vibrations of the earth, are thought to be a complex language, and their memory is believed to span across centuries, holding the knowledge of the ancients within their minds.

\columnbreak

Titanic apes live in solitude, each holding dominion over vast territories that they guard fiercely. Intrusion into their realm is not taken lightly. They have an innate connection to the wilderness within their territories, making them the ultimate guardians of their domain.

They are mostly peaceful, preferring to keep to their own territories, away from the civilized world. However, when enraged or threatened, they can cause immense destruction, their roars alone capable of breaking the resolve of any wh would dare to keep their rampage in check.

Despite their formidable power and size, titanic apes are considered symbols of primal power and protection in many cultures. They are often central characters in ancient myths and legends, embodying the raw, untamed essence of the world.

#### Epic Titanic Ape Encounter
If you're aiming to transform a titanic ape into a formidable adversary for an intense boss battle, consider doubling its maximum hit points to a total of 597, elevating its CR to 20, and granting it the following trait:<br><br>

> ***Tantrum (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Upon reaching half its hit points (297 or less), the ape ends any spells or conditions of its choice that are currently affecting it. Simultaneously, it releases any creatures or objects it is holding and commences a ground-pounding tantrum that can last up to a minute. <br> In order to maintain this tantrum, the ape must use its action each turn to use Ferocious Roar. The tantrum ends early if it ends its turn without using Ferocious Roar, loses concentration (as if concentrating on a spell), or can no longer reach a solid surface with its arms.<br> While the ape is engaged in this tantrum, it gains the following effects:<br>
> * Both its hands are considered occupied.
> * It cannot use the Grasp, Throw, or Rending Bite legendary actions
> * It gains Reverberating Slam (described below) as a bonus action and a legendary action.<br><br>
> **Reverberating Slam.** Each creature within 60 feet of the titanic ape must succeed a DC 21 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from the ape. If the save fails by 10 or more (DC 11), the creature is pushed 20 feet away. On a successful save, the creature only takes half the damage and isn't pushed.

### Ape Adventure Hooks

| d12  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Gibbon Take:** Gibbons have begun sneaking into a jungle village and stealing valuables that catch their eye. The party has been hired to venture into the jungle treetops and retrieve the most valuable stolen goods by stealing them back or perhaps even trying to trade them back from the gibbons.|
|  2  |**The Chimp's Riddle:** A small troupe of chimpanzees has recently started to invade a local town, causing mischief and chaos. It seems they are searching for something specific in the town's library. The adventurers are hired to find a way to communicate with the chimps and figure out what they're after, all while avoiding the ire of the town's increasingly frustrated librarian.|
|  3 | **Chimpanzee Heist:** A group of highly intelligent chimps have escaped from a wizard's lab and stolen a valuable magical artifact. The chimps are causing chaos and mayhem in the city as they evade capture. The adventurers must outwit and recapture them without causing harm, retrieve the artifact, and unravel the mystery behind their unusual intelligence.|
|  4  |**The Jufu Threat:** A nearby mountain pass, crucial for trade, has recently been taken over by a group of Jufus who throw rocks at anyone who attempts to cross. The adventurers must clear the path, either by driving away the Jufus or finding a way to appease them. This could involve strategic combat, using the terrain to their advantage, or an intricate negotiation using sign language and gestures.|
|  5  |**The Jufu's Stolen Treasure:** A clan of Jufus renowned for their collection of precious gems have had their treasure stolen by a rogue band of mountain bandits. The Jufus have become restless and started attacking local villages. The adventurers must track down the bandits, retrieve the treasure, and return it to the Jufus to restore peace.|
|  6  | **The Gorilla Stampede:** The gorillas in the region have started to stampede without any apparent reason, causing destruction in their wake. The adventurers are hired to find the source of their unusual behavior. This could lead them to a group of poachers, a dangerous beast terrorizing the gorillas, or a seismic activity that’s about to cause a major natural disaster.|

### Ape Tactics

#### Gibbons 
In the wild, gibbons will instinctively flee from any threats, adeptly swinging away through the trees. However, gibbon familiars can be particularly useful in environments like jungles, forests, or even urban landscapes.

#### Chimpanzees 
Chimpanzees can be quite aggressive and are known to engage in warfare with other chimps or hunt smaller animals when in groups. When alone, a chimpanzee will escape to the safety of trees if confronted by a predator its size or larger, and a group will do the same against sufficiently large threats. They typically start combat by using their Fling ability to hurl sticks or nearby rocks, before closing in to use their Slam and Bite attacks and then Grapple, focusing their efforts on a single target.

#### Gorillas and Giant Apes 
These large apes are non-violent by nature and will generally only attack if surprised or threatened. Initially, they attempt to scare opponents away through intimidation. If this fails, they will charge, attacking and grappling their adversary. They might even throw the opponent they want to encourage to leave.

#### Jufu
Jufus exhibit behavior similar to chimpanzees, hunting small game and living in small groups. They may exhibit aggression towards other mountain creatures that encroach on their territory. Jufus prefer to fight from a position of advantage, such as higher ground, pelting their opponents with rocks until they retreat. If a creature manages to reach the jufu by climbing, the jufu might attempt to shove it down the cliff.

#### Titanic Apes
Titanic apes behave similarly to gorillas and giant apes. They first attempt to use their Ferocious Roar to scare off opponents. If unsuccessful, they will charge into the battle, primarily using Slam if they can hit two or more targets, or Bite if they can only reach a single target.

**Legendary Actions.** If the titan ape manages to grapple a target, it will use Rending Bite on the grappled target and then throw it. If a target escapes its grapple, the ape will attempt to grapple the target again, then throw it, and finally attempt to grapple a different target on its next turn.

While not highly intelligent, titan apes are smart enough to differentiate between enemies who can deal damage from a distance and those who need to be in melee. They strategically use their grapple to control the battlefield, potentially flinging a grappled melee attacker far away or toward another ranged enemy. They also line up players for multi-target Slam attacks.

**Mythic Encounter.** In the mythic version, the Titan Ape loses all tactical instincts during its tantrum, blindly charging toward the closest foe.

### Ape Loot
The valuable items looted from apes will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Apes don’t provide quite as much quality harvesting materials as other beasts, but because giant apes and titanic apes are more intelligent, they may wear or keep more valuable items they’ve collected. If you’re using a giant or titanic ape in a climactic battle, it is usually good to provide some high-value “art objects” from the DMG they’ve collected for players to find. 


#### Ape Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
