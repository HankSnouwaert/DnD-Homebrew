# Otters

These semi-aquatic creatures are known for their playful antics and slippery agility.  With their thick, waterproof coats and ability to hold their breath for long periods, otters are well suited to spending their days in the water and deep diving for food. The otter's small, cute appearance belies its formidable hunting and foraging prowess.  Though otters usually don't threaten humanoids, their speed, intelligence, and powerful bite make them more dangerous than they would appear.  With their keen eyesight and aquatic agility, otters are deadly hunters, and, in some cases, even the apex predators.   

## River Otters

The majority of otters are fresh water dwellers.  Equipped with long, slick bodies and powerful tails, river otters can be as small as 2 feet long and 2 pounds in weight to as large as 6 feet long and 100 pounds in weight.  Though they are generally not aggressive towards humanoids, they can be ferocious if provoked or if they view someone, as prey.

***Pack Hunters.*** Although river otters can hunt for small creatures on their own, many coordinate their attacks in pairs or larger groups.  This often involves cooperative fishing efforts, as otters work together to direct fish towards their pack mates.  Sometimes their pack hunting is used to bring down larger creatures that would otherwise be beyond the capabilities of a single river otter.   

***Giant River Otters.***   While most river otters are too small to threaten humanoid-sized creatures, some reach much greater sizes and can hunt larger prey.  The largest of these river otters are the aptly named giant river otters.  While they are not formidable individually, their pack hunting abilities make them apex predators of their environment.  When pack hunting, giant river otters can even bring down fearsome creatures such as caimans and anacondas.

Wolf otters make effective patrol and hunting animals when working with druids or other powerful beings of nature who live near remote riverways.  A pack of aggressive wolf otters can easily spell doom for a group of inexperienced explorers trespassing through their territory.

## Sea Otters

By far the most divergent of all otters, these creatures have adapted to living their lives almost entirely at sea.  Unlike most otters, sea otters are adapted to living in saltwater environments near coastlines.  They can reach lengths of nearly 5 feet and weigh up to 100 pounds, but they lack the long powerful tails of other otters.  Despite their relatively large size and powerful bite, sea otters generally don't pose a threat to humanoids and other larger creatures unless severely provoked.

***Awkward Walkers.*** Sea otters have adapted to spending nearly all of their lives at sea and don't move nearly as well over land as other otters.  Rather than coming ashore to rest, sea otters spend their days floating on their backs.  When they need to sleep, they will link arms with other sea otters to avoid drifting out to sea.

***Tool Users.*** Sea otters don't hunt in aggressive packs for fast-moving targets like other otters.  Clams, crustaceans, and other sea-dwelling invertebrates make up the majority of their diet.  To penetrate the tough shells many of these creatures possess, sea otters learn how to use stones to bash through the hardened defenses of their prey.  Sea otters can often be seen resting on their back at the ocean surface, with their latest catch perched on their stomach, bashing away at the soon-to-be meal.

> ##### Otters as Familiars
> **River otters** and **sea otters** may be used as familiar options when casting the *find familiar* spell. If a **sea otter** is used this way, it may still use its Rock attack option against objects.

## Thieving Otter
These strange and often infuriating creatures look similar to ordinary otters, but the evidence of their fey origin is evident at a glance.  They are often exotic shades of blue, pink, or purple and usually sport additional flair such as fins or feathery mohawks.  There is also an unmistakable, mischievous intelligence gleaming in their eyes.  Thieving otters earn their namesake from their notorious penchant for robbing other creatures blind, and they possess several magical abilities that allow them to do so with ease.  

***Rift Walkers.***  Not only do thieving otters possess the seemingly supernatural ability to avoid being grabbed or restrained, but they are also able to create small, short-range rifts that allow them to quickly teleport between locations.  

This teleportation allows them to appear seemingly out of nowhere, grab their desired items, and disappear before anyone can respond.  Only other otters can traverse these rifts, and an entire pack of otters can travel in and out of a rift in the blink of an eye, allowing them to go on high-speed raids. 

***Fey Thieves For Hire.*** Thieving otters form packs that roam rivers running through the Feywild and near fey crossings while looking for their next big score.  Though their behavior appears chaotic and impulsive, they often act on behalf of equally chaotic and impulsive fey lords.  Some thieving otter packs act as the Feywild equivalent of thief's guilds, working as burglars for hire on behalf of other powerful and affluent fey nobles.  Travelers are their favorite targets, but a wily adventurer with something to offer may be able to bargain with or even hire a pack of thieving otters.

> ***Amphibious.*** The otter can breathe air and water.
>
>***Escape Artist.*** The otter can use 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature grappling it. It can also spend 5 feet of movement when it is prone to stand up, rather than half its speed.
>
> ***Keen Sight.*** The otter has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
>
> ***Pack Tactics.*** The otter has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the otter's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.
>
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d4 + 5) piercing damage.  If it hits a creature, the otter may make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check from the target creature.  If the creature fails the check, the otter may steal a small object of its choice that the target is holding or carrying on its person.
>
> ***Aquatic Rift (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The otter creates an invisible and immobile rift at an unoccupied point it can see within 5 feet of it that is submerged in water. The dimensional rift bridges the distance between that space and any point within 60 feet of it that the otter can see or specify by distance and direction (such as "60 feet straight up"). While next to the rift, the otter can see through it and is considered to be next to the destination as well, and anything the otter puts through the rift (including a portion of its body) emerges at the destination. Only otters can use the rift, and it lasts for 10 minutes, or until part of the rift is no longer submerged in water. 
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Cunning Thief.*** The otter can take a Disengage action, Hide action, Use An Object action, or make a Dexterity (Slight of Hand) check.
