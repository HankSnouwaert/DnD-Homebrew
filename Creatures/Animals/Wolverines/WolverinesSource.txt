On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) fire damage and is poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 12), the creature is stunned until the poison ends. A creature that has resistance to fire damage has advantage on the saving throw, and a creature that is immune to fire damage automatically succeeds. A creature that has vulnerability to fire damage has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and 14 (4d6) fire damage and is covered in the toxic spray for the next minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't covered in spray. Until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the spray off itself or another creature, it has the wolverine's Choking Smog ability (the creature is subjected to its own Choking Smog at the start of each of its turns).

### Wolverine Tactics
Wolverines rely on sheer ferocity to defeat their opponents and aren't afraid to confront creatures that are larger or tougher, especially if there's a potential meal at stake. In one-on-one combat, wolverines always employ their reckless attack feature. However, when facing multiple foes, they opt not to use this feature.

#### Burning Rage Wolverines Tactics:
These elementals generally employ the same tactics as regular wolverines. However, when faced with overwhelming numbers, they may initiate the encounter with their Sulfur Spray to even the odds.


**Burning Rage Wolverine Alpha Tactics.**
This variant utilizes its legendary move actions to close the distance with opponents. Once in range, it relies on its Slash legendary action to initiate melee combat. If its opponents prove to be evasive or are out of reach, the alpha will prioritize recharging its Sulfur Spray ability.

#### Werewolverine Tactics

Werewolverines are typically solitary creatures, although they may occasionally have a few underlings whom they've coerced into serving them. These lycanthropes tend to adopt the tactics of their namesake, the wolverine (described above). 

In combat, they focus their ferocity on a single target, usually one they deem worthy of carrying their curse. They rely on their claws and avoid using their bite attack until the targeted individual reaches half health or two rounds have passed without the opponent dying or being rendered unconscious. This delay signifies the werewolverine's recognition of the target's worthiness to bear its curse.

### Wolverine Loot
The valuable items looted from wolverines will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Being elementals, most of a burning rage wolverine's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the burnt stone and ashes it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Because lycanthropes revert to their humanoid form when they are slain, most of the valuable items players can collect from werewolverines will be worn items or items dropped by their former victims. These valuables may include standard coinage. These items can be found using a **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Wolverine Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
