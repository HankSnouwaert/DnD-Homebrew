## Wolverines
Wolverines are the largest members of the weasel family, with body lengths that can reach over 4 feet and weights reaching 55 pounds. They have a stocky and muscular build, with short legs, broad and rounded heads, small eyes, and short, rounded ears. Their fur is thick, dark brown, and often has a light brown stripe running down each side of their body. They have powerful jaws that can bite through bone and sharp claws that allow them to burrow through dirt.

Wolverines are found in remote reaches of the northern boreal forests and subarctic and alpine tundras, demonstrating remarkable adaptability to different environments. Their dense fur and snowshoe-like paws allow them to traverse harsh snowy environments, and they are known for their ability to travel great distances, often through harsh terrain and severe weather. This is a necessary adaptation as wolverines are solitary animals with large territories that they mark with scent. These territories can range from 50 to 10 square miles for females and up to 240 for males.

Wolverines have potent scent glands that they use for marking their territory and communicating with other wolverines. These glands secrete a strong, musky odor. The scent from these glands is used to mark their large territories. This marking serves as a warning to other wolverines and animals to stay away. It's particularly important since wolverines are solitary animals and require large areas for foraging. To humanoids, the smell of a wolverine's scent marking is often described as quite unpleasant and pungent. 

They are omnivores with a diet that includes carrion, small animals, birds, fish, and vegetation. They are also capable of taking down prey larger than themselves, such as weak or injured deer. Wolverines have a reputation for being aggressive hunters, often defending their food aggressively against larger predators. They are notoriously tenacious and fierce, usually standing their ground against overwhelming odds.

### Megalictis
Known colloquially as dire wolverines, these primeval creatures are larger and more fearsome relatives to the modern wolverine. The megalictis other wolverines and is a terrifying sight to behold. With a body length that can reach up to 2 meters (over 6 feet) and a weight approximating that of a large modern-day predator, this beast combines the ferocity of a wolverine with the stature of a jaguar. 

The megalictis is a solitary and highly territorial creature with a vast hunting range, covering extensive swathes of forest and tundra. It marks its territory with a potent scent, more intense than that of any modern mustelid, serving as a clear warning to any who dares to trespass. 

With powerful jaws and robust teeth, the megalictis is an apex predator of its domain, hunting large prey, using its immense strength and surprising agility to take down animals much larger than itself. This predator is not one to be challenged lightly; tales of its hunting prowess are the stuff of legend among the tundra-dwelling cultures who share its home.

### Werewolverines
Few lycanthropes exhibit the savagery and fearlessness seen in werewolverines, and victims of their curse become battle-hungry seekers of bloody combat. Even the two natural weaknesses of werewolverines, silver and fire, cannot deter them when they are consumed by the frenzy of their curse.

***Warrior Nomads.*** Most werewolverines are solitary by nature, roaming frigid tundras or remote mountains alone. However, they possess an insatiable desire to confront the most formidable opponents they can find, traveling great distances from one fight to the next and leaving a trail of bloodshed in their wake. Legends from these frozen lands tell of werewolverines appearing before villages and tribes, demanding challenges from their mightiest warriors. 

These creatures often terrorize the communities, extorting food and treasure before moving on. When a werewolverine encounters a worthy adversary within a community, it may bite them, spreading its curse. The bitten individual is allowed to live but is marked for future confrontation, with the hope that they may one day provide a worthy challenge.

***Lycanthrope Hunters.*** Werewolverines pose a special threat to other lycanthropes they encounter. Werewolverines often carry silver-tipped javelins, as they view werewolves, werebears, and even other werewolverines as truly worthy kills. Most other lycanthropes consider werewolverines to be deranged and avoid them at all costs, even relinquishing territory and resources to appease these fearsome creatures.

### Burning Rage Wolverines
In the frozen expanses of the world, where massive beasts roam amidst icy tundras, one creature instills fear even in these formidable inhabitants—the burning rage Wolverine. This creature takes the form of a massive wolverine, engulfed in noxious flames that reek of sulfur. Its claws blaze with heated brimstone, causing the ice and snow beneath its paws to melt away.

***Ice Hunters.*** The fiery claws and teeth of the Burning Rage Wolverine make it a perfect hunter of the large ice beasts and creatures that dwell in the cold corners of the world. These creatures rely on these hunts to sustain their supernatural flames. Among their prey are ice caribou, yetis, frost salamanders, and occasionally, even frost wurms and young tundra-dwelling dragons have fallen victim to their relentless appetite. Their affinity for icey creatures even drives them to hunt wizards and druids who wield ice magic. 

***Charred Homes.*** Beyond their fiery claws, they possess the ability to release waves of scorching stench that can overwhelm creatures adapted to colder climates. This noxious stench can be launched over great distances in explosive bursts, poisoning and burning their unfortunate victims.

When a burning rage wolverines successfully bring down particularly massive prey, they carve out the creature's body and repurpose it into a new dwelling. These repurposed corpses serve as shelter, keeping them warm and sustaining them through the harshest winter seasons. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Sometimes, they also serve as a home for a mating pair to give birth to their young. Adventurers should exercise caution if they come across a charred corpse in the midst of the tundra, as burning rage wolverines are fiercely territorial and will not tolerate any intruders near their abodes.

On a failed save, the creature takes 7 (2d6) fire damage and is poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't poisoned. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 12), the creature is stunned until the poison ends. A creature that has resistance to fire damage has advantage on the saving throw, and a creature that is immune to fire damage automatically succeeds. A creature that has vulnerability to fire damage has disadvantage on the saving throw.

Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) poison damage and 14 (4d6) fire damage and is covered in the toxic spray for the next minute. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't covered in spray. Until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the spray off itself or another creature, it has the wolverine's Choking Smog ability (the creature is subjected to its own Choking Smog at the start of each of its turns).

\columnbreak



|   |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  4  | **Primeval Spirits:** The players come across a small town haunted by spirits believed to be the echoes of ancient megalictises that roamed the area in ages past. Superstitious locals think the spirits of these "dire wolverines" are returning in the flesh to hunt the intruders in their territory.   |
|  5  | **The Scorched Tundra:** The adventurers stumble upon a tundra that has been scorched and melted, with local wildlife devastated. The cause is a Burning Rage Wolverine, which must be tracked and dealt with before it turns the entire region into a wasteland. |
|  6  | **The Ice Mage's Request:** An ice mage seeks a component found only within the body of a Burning Rage Wolverine for a powerful spell to counter a growing fire elemental threat. The adventurers are hired to hunt one of these creatures and retrieve the needed component.|
|  7  | **The Charred Den:** While traveling through a harsh tundra, the players find the charred corpse of a frost worm, which they have either been tasked with harvesting or must take shelter in to avoid an incoming storm. However, they soon find themselves facing the fiery elemental wolverine dwelling within. |
|  8  | **Icy Vengence:** The players encounter an adult tundra-dwelling dragon (either a savage white dragon or benevolent silver dragon) whose younger kin have been slain by a burning rage wolverine. The dragon offers them a reward in exchange for helping it enact its revenge.|
|  9  |**The Nomad's Trail:** The adventurers must track a werewolverine across the tundra, following a trail of destruction. Their journey leads them through harsh environments, facing the creature’s previous victims and other dangers of the wild. |
|  10  | **The Lycanthrope Hunter:** A werebear whose kin have been slain by a brutal werewolverine hunter approaches the players, asking them for help in putting a stop to the killer before he becomes the next victim. |
|  11  | **The Werewolverine's Arena:** A ruthless lord has captured a werewolverine and is using it as the star attraction in his gladiatorial games. The adventurers can be captured and forced to fight, tasked with rescuing the creature, or hired to stop the games altogether. However, they may soon find the werewolverine is all too happy to remain and enjoy the neverending bloodshed.|
|  12  | **Curse of Fury:** One of the adventurers or a key NPC has been bitten by a werewolverine and is now marked for a future confrontation. The party must seek a cure for the curse or prepare for the inevitable battle when the werewolverine returns.|

### Wolverine Tactics
Wolverines rely on sheer ferocity to defeat their opponents and aren't afraid to confront creatures that are larger or tougher, especially if there's a potential meal at stake. In one-on-one combat, wolverines always employ their reckless attack feature. However, when facing multiple foes, they opt not to use this feature.

#### Burning Rage Wolverines Tactics:
These elementals generally employ the same tactics as regular wolverines. However, when faced with overwhelming numbers, they may initiate the encounter with their Sulfur Spray to even the odds.


**Burning Rage Wolverine Alpha Tactics.**
This variant utilizes its legendary move actions to close the distance with opponents. Once in range, it relies on its Slash legendary action to initiate melee combat. If its opponents prove to be evasive or are out of reach, the alpha will prioritize recharging its Sulfur Spray ability.

#### Werewolverine Tactics

Werewolverines are typically solitary creatures, although they may occasionally have a few underlings whom they've coerced into serving them. These lycanthropes tend to adopt the tactics of their namesake, the wolverine (described above). 

In combat, they focus their ferocity on a single target, usually one they deem worthy of carrying their curse. They rely on their claws and avoid using their bite attack until the targeted individual reaches half health or two rounds have passed without the opponent dying or being rendered unconscious. This delay signifies the werewolverine's recognition of the target's worthiness to bear its curse.

\columnbreak

### Wolverine Loot
The valuable items looted from wolverines will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Being elementals, most of a burning rage wolverine's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the burnt stone and ashes it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Because lycanthropes revert to their humanoid form when they are slain, most of the valuable items players can collect from werewolverines will be worn items or items dropped by their former victims. These valuables may include standard coinage. These items can be found using a **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Wolverine Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
