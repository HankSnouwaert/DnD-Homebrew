## Werewolves
These savage predators are the most common and notorious of all lycanthropes. By day, they are aggressive and hot-tempered humanoids with a penchant for rare meat and an affinity for canines. When their tranformation takes place, they either turn into large, bloodthirsty wolves or terrifying wolf-human hybrids, with lupine heads and fur on a vaguely bipedal humanoid body complete with long arms and slashing claws. Though their paw-hands in this form are capable of manipulating objects and wielding weapons, werewolves much prefer slashing apart their prey with their iron-hard claws. 

Their lycanthropic resilience also makes them almost impossible to kill. Outside of silvered weapons, the only known means of reliably slaying werewolves is through the use of powerful soundwaves which damage their sensitive lupine hearing.



***Ravagers of Civilization.***
Most who contract werewolf lycanthropy withdraw from civilization. Even those who embrace their curse and care nothing for the harm they cause know they can't maintain their guise among other humanoids for long because, when a werewolf's transformation occurs, it becomes the anathema of all things civilized. The veneer of principles and rationality melt away, and primal instincts take over. The overriding emotion werewolves often feel is rage towards the civilized society that keeps them chained beneath the surface for the majority of their life. As such, werewolves often prioritize hunting other humanoids as a way of exacting their vengeance on the shackles of civilization. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some humanoids embrace this hatred and actively seek to tear down civilization even when in their humanoid form. Others fight against it, trying to maintain their guise of civility, which only serves to fuel the fury of the wolf within. Others find a way to make peace with their inner beast, and while still savage at heart, they are able to channel their ferocity in a way that minimizes harm to other innocent sentient creatures.

***Pack Hunters and Lone Wolves.*** The wolf's tendency to run in packs carries over to werewolves, who often form hunting groups in the wild to better catch particularly dangerous or evasive prey. These werewolf packs utilize many of the same techniques as wolves: silently stalking prey, launching ambushes designed to frighten their victims into fleeing, and isolating targets for coordinated takedowns. These hunts are usually led by a powerful pack leader who picks out the target and coordinates the werewolves' attacks against that victim, ensuring a bloody kill. 

Other werewolves live a more solitary life, shunning the company of their kind. This might be done out of rejection of their curse, because they don't wish to share their kills, or because they work with other non-lupine creatures. Though this isolation helps lone werewolves become more dangerous in isolation than those accustomed to working with a pack, they lack the ability to utilize the pack tactics of their more sociable kin.

### Werewolf Moon Mystics

All werewolves feel a primal connection to the moon and the urge to unleash their bestial impulses follows its phases. Some introspective werewolves study and meditate upon this connection, plumbing the depths of their primal psyche and how it intertwines with the moon's phases. This path not only helps these werewolves to better temper and regulate their reckless bloodthirst, but allows them to channel lunar power through their body. 

These werewolves come to be known as moon mystics, and they are known for the serene grace with which they take on their lupine aspect and are even better known for their ability to dispatch foes with magical blasts of moonlight. The restraint moon mystics are capable of allows them to avoid diving right into the fray and target dangerous foes from a distance with their lunar bolts and burning moonbeams. 

The ascetic nature of these werewolves means they rarely participate in hunts with others of their kind and often live as contemplative hermits. However, when moon mystics do join or interact with werewolf packs, they often serve as spiritual leaders. Some mystics temper the aggression of their kin, but others will warp the social dynamic of their pack, giving it a cult-like dynamic as they lead disturbing rituals designed to pursue inscrutable goals.

(3/Day)*** *Ranged Spell attack:* +6 to hit, range 120 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) radiant damage and moonlight illuminates the target until the end of the werewolf's next turn. While illuminated this way, the target sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius, any attack roll against an affected target has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected target can't benefit from being invisible.
>
> ***Searing Moonlight. (1/Day)*** A pale beam of moonlight appears and fills a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within 120 of the werewolf. The cylinder lasts as long as the werewolf maintains concentration on it, up to a minute (as if concentrating on a spell). The area of the cylinder is considered dimly lit. Any non-shapechanger that is caught in the area of the moonbeam when it first appears or that ends its turn within the moonbeam must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. It takes 16 (3d10) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. While maintaining concentration on this ability, the werewolf can use its bonus action to move the beam 30 feet in any direction.

Each other creature within 120 feet of the werewolf must then succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the werewolf. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Werewolf Encounter Guide

Werewolves are the most common and iconic of lycanthropes, and players might encounter them while traveling through lonely roads and settlements along wild frontiers. They usually dwell in areas where civilization is at odds with the wilds, though some werewolves trying to avoid harming humanoids may dwell in the deep wilderness, and some brazen werewolves may live in the heart of civilization. 

Sometimes players will face werewolves who have unwillingly transformed during a full moon. They will lack the tactical options of a werewolf who has mastered its curse but will still use the wolfish tactics that come naturally to them. Werewolves who have embraced their curse are far more dangerous, as they can pass for humanoids until the time comes for them to reveal their deadly nature.

### Werewolf Motivations
Because lycanthropes retain the intelligence of humanoids, their motivations can be broad and complex. Still, a werewolf's nature will inevitably shape its motivations and goals. Werewolves feel an innate drive to hunt and kill, with their ire directed towards humanoids of their own species in particular. Those who embrace this nature may seek the destruction of all things civilized. Those who reject their curse will have goals focused on suppressing their nature.

#### General Werewolf Motivations
* Hunting for food 
* Satisfying bloodlust
* Protecting territory
* Aiding packmates
* Ravaging civilization 
* Hiding or suppressing curse

#### Moon Mystic Motivations
* Anything in the pursuit of primeval spiritualism, including:
    *  Serving nature dieties
    * Providing spiritual leadership to other werewolves
    * Recovering ancient druidic relics


### Tactics
Werewolves instinctually utilize many of the same tactics of ordinary wolfs. However, their humanoid intelligence and shapeshifting abilities allow them to implement these tactics in much more sophisticated ways. The specifics of these tactics will depend greatly on the types of werewolves and how much control they have over their shapeshifting abilities.

#### Engagement
Like wolves, werewolves prefer to stalk their prey, closing in as close as possible before their presence is known. When operating as a pack, they will surround their quarry to cut off as many avenues of escape as possible. If they can assume their humanoid forms, they may use deception to lure victims into isolated locations before shapeshifting and unleashing a surprise attack. However, this tactic doesn’t provide as much satisfaction as hunting in their bestial forms and is usually reserved for especially dangerous enemies.

#### Combat

Werewolves are highly aggressive combatants that leverage regenerative abilities to survive what would otherwise be reckless head-on assaults. A werewolf that picks its prey is relentless in its hunt. Enemies wielding silver or thunder magic may be avoided or singled out by a werewolf, depending on whether it is looking for an easy kill or the slaughter of its enemies entirely. 

##### Combat: Pack Werewolves
Werewolves operating in a pack will fight much the same way as wolves. When spotted by foes, they will attempt to drive their enemies into fleeing so they can run them down. Once werewolves close in on their prey, they will focus on a target that appears most vulnerable and attempt to isolate and surround it so they can utilize their pack tactics. 

These targets are most often enemy spell casters or other soft targets who can cause a lot of trouble for the werewolves. If there are enough pack members, the werewolves may send some of their group to harass and distract other foes while they finish off their priority victims. Any enemy wielding a silvered weapon or capable of dealing thunder damage becomes a priority target for werewolves, and they will surround and kill such a foe as quickly as possible.


##### Combat: Packleaders
If a packleader is present, it will usually use its Hunters Howl to force its foes to flee and to help its pack close the distance. The packleader will also be the one to set high-priority targets for the pack, and its Dogpile trait enables the werewolves to take down these targets that much faster.

##### Combat: Lone Werewolves
Lone werewolves lack access to the group tactics of pack werewolves but will otherwise use the same general tactics of other werewolves. They may work with other types of creatures in combat but don’t rely on having allies present to be effective at taking down soft targets.

##### Combat: Moon Mystics
Moon mystics will generally stay out of melee combat and hurl lunar bolts at high-priority targets that might be staying out of reach of the rest of the pack. They will, in turn, utilize their pack to keep enemies from reaching them so they can better utilize their ranged attacks and avoid losing concentration on Searing Moonlight.

If the opportunity presents itself, it is most efficient for moon mystics to start combat with their Searing Moonlight so they can use their bonus action each subsequent turn to control it while making other attacks. If one or more enemies are tied up in melee combat with other werewolves, the mystic will use its Searing Moonlight on those enemies to help whittle them down since it won't damage other werewolves. They may also use their Searing Moonlight on casters hiding away from combat in an attempt to force them to lose concentration on any ongoing spells. The mystic’s Pale Hex trait means Searing Moonlight can also be used to hamper the ranged abilities of snipers.



#### Retreat
Despite their bloodthirsty natures, werewolves have a strong sense of self-preservation. Their ravenous natures and regeneration will keep them fighting longer than wolves, though most werewolves will attempt to flee if they are reduced to less than half health or outnumbered by well-armed opponents. If a powerful figure such as a packleader or moon mystic commands the pack and is still in the fight, the other werewolves may continue fighting even if wounded or outnumbered. However, most werewolf leaders will attempt to withdraw their pack if they sense they are losing.

The presence of silvered weapons or thunder magic amongst their enemies will make werewolves more likely to flee if they are unable to put a stop to the source of the damage. However, even foes without silver of thunder may be able to beat werewolves into submission. And, a werewolf is unlikely to continue fighting an enemy if it can't gain the upper hand, even if that enemy has no clear way to slay it outright.

## Werewolf Loot Guide
Because lycanthropes revert to their humanoid form when they are slain, most of the valuable items players can collect from them will be worn items or items dropped by their former victims. These valuables may include standard coinage. 

### Lootable Werewolf Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Werewolf Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Moon Mystic Items |  Intelligence (Religion) |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.


##### Example Item Names
| GP <br> Value  | Moon Mystic Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  5sp  | Sylvan Charm | 
|  1gp |  Pale Totem |  
|  5gp | Lunar Idol |  
|  10gp| Moon Stone |

### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to harvest depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're harvesting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you don't want to require a check on the part of the players, you can instead roll a d20 with the modifier determined by the table to determine what the players find randomly.
