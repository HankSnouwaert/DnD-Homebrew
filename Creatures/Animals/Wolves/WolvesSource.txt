## Wolves
These majestic and deadly hunters roam many of the world’s forests and tundras, using their brutally effective pack-hunting tactics to fell much larger and more dangerous animals. Wolves strike fear in the hearts of humanoids who venture too far into the wilds, and their notoriety has earned them a place as common monsters and villains in many fables and children’s tales. The sounds of distant howling will alert travelers that they are entering wolf territory, and few do so willingly unless traveling in a well-armed group. Any travelers who become lost and isolated in the woods will have little hope of survival should a pack of wolves pick up their scent.

***Master Pack Hunters.*** 
Those who catch the attention of a wolf pack will often be oblivious to their peril as the pack silently stalks its prey, slowly closing in until they are noticed. Once the pack is spotted, it will close in and attempt to drive its prey into fleeing. Sufficiently powerful prey that stands its ground and proves intimidating enough may be able to drive the wolves away. Wolves that press the attack will attempt to separate the weakest-looking target from its companions and drag it to the ground, where it can be subdued with vicious bites. Even if the prey manages to flee, the wolves will relentlessly pursue it until they are able to surround and slaughter their victim.

&emsp; ***Fiercely Loyal Allies.*** The group dynamics and hunting strategies of wolves are similar enough to most <br> humanoids that they are often able to integrate <br> themselves into tribes living far from civilization. These wolves might live amongst druidic circles, barbarian <br> tribes to the north, orcish warbands, or goblinoid <br> warrens. Regardless of the group, the wolf's instinct <br> toward teamwork and loyalty to hierarchical packs leaves <br> it well suited to many vital roles. Wolves will serve their adopted families as sentries, hunters, and war beasts in combat. They are adept at following verbal and somatic instructions from their humanoid companions to <br> coordinate their efforts.

***Dire Wolves.*** These primeval wolves are a more <br> primitive and savage version of their modern kin. They are more often found in wilder regions that have remained untouched by civilization. Here, they prey on large game <br> as well as any humanoids attempting to eke out an <br> existence in the unforgiving wilds. Like ordinary wolves, <br> dire wolves are prized allies amongst any humanoids able <br> to humanoids able to tame or befriend them, though this <br> is a difficult and dangerous prospect for any without <br> druidic abilities. As dire wolves are often favored by gods <br> of winter or the hunt, they may also be sent to aid those <br> who curry the favor of such gods. Though, just are just as likely to be sent to hunt and devour those who displease <br> the gods by daring to challenge the might of the wilds.

### Ascendant Packleader


Wolves blend ferocity, beauty, and teamwork in such a way that many humanoids regard them with a sense of awe that borders on reverence. As such, they are a favored animal among many celestial beings and a common form for sacred beasts to assume. Ascendant packleaders are a form of divine wolf created to lead wolf packs on the Material Plane in service of a higher purpose. They may have once been ordinary wolves elevated to divine status or celestials who took on a lupine form when they entered the Material Plane. 

Once an ascendant packleader has taken command of a wolf pack, it leads its lupine brethren with supernatural efficiency. Packleaders can bark orders at their pack mates, enabling them to perform complex tactical maneuvers normally beyond the capabilities of such creatures, and their supernatural howls can break the resolve of prey while driving their allies to victory. 

Using these powers of command, the ascendant packleader also drives its pack to pursue higher-level goals normally beyond the comprehension of ordinary wolves. These goals may simply be to protect a sacred wood, or they may involve furthering large-scale agendas in service of a god or other divine being. The nature of these goals and the packleaders pursuing them are as varied as the gods they serve. Noble packleaders act in service to gods seeking to protect the sanctity of life and nature, while brutal packleaders sent by wicked gods of the wilds take cruel pleasure in hunting humanoids and undoing the works of civilization.

> ***Hunter's Howl (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).***  The packleader may move up to its speed before emitting a howl that terrifies its prey and rallies its pack. Up to 6 allies within 120 feet of the packleader can use their reaction to perform one of the options described in its Bark Order ability. They must all use the same option, which the packleader chooses. Each other creature within 120 feet of the packleader must then succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of it for 1 minute and must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from the packleader. The creature doesn’t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or a pit. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
>
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Bark Order.***  The packleader emits a commanding bark and chooses one creature other than itself within 60 feet of it that can hear it. That creature can then use its reaction to do one of the following: 
>
> &#8226; It moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
>
> &#8226; It makes one melee weapon attack or unarmed strike. If the attack has advantage from at least two sources, and one of them is due to the target being prone, the attack deals an extra 7(2d6) damage.
>
> &#8226; If the creature is suffering an effect that requires it to make a saving throw at the beginning or end of its next turn, it immediately makes that save.

## Wolf Encounter Guide

Wolves are a classic, low-level enemy for fledgling adventurers to face in the wild. Dire wolves are larger and provide a greater challenge but operate in the same manner. Like most predatory beasts, players are likely to encounter wolves when they wander into a pack’s territory, a desperately hungry pack is hunting them, or the wolves are being used as war beasts by other humanoids. 

Regardless of the encounter’s circumstances, wolves rely on their numbers and pack tactics to overwhelm their foes. Wolves aren’t likely to attack humanoids unless they outnumber them or are starving. Dire wolves may be more brazen about attacking in smaller numbers due to their size advantage over humanoids. Still, even they aren’t likely to attack if their prey outnumbers them and appears in good condition. 

### Wolf Motivations
Being beasts, wolves usually have straightforward motivations driving their goals. A wolf pack lead by an ascendant packleader may have a more complex agenda.

#### General Wolf Motivations
* Hunt for food
* Protect territory
* Act in service or protection of those it perceives as packmates

#### Ascendant Packleader Motivations
* Serve the sacred purpose it was created for


### Wolf Tactics
While wolves may be beasts with simple motivations, they excel at hunting in packs and are capable of coordinated group tactics in combat. They utilize the same tactics when hunting in the wild or with humanoid masters.

#### Engagement

With their Keen Sense, wolves are likely to detect potential prey before they themselves are noticed. The wolves will then attempt to stalk and stealthily approach their prey, closing in as close as possible before being seen. Once spotted, the wolves try to drive their prey into fleeing. They may use intimidation or run at a target in an attempt to spook it, but they prefer to stay out of striking distance of creatures standing their ground. 

\columnbreak

#### Combat

If one or more creatures run, the wolves will chase after them unless isolated targets are left behind for the wolves to surround. If multiple creatures scatter, the wolves will close in on one target. Wolves will chase prey long distances, exhausting their victims before closing in for the kill. If a wolf can close the distance, it will attempt to use its trip attack, hampering the target’s ability to flee and giving other wolves a chance to close in from all sides.

If all the creatures stand their ground, they make themselves much less appealing prey to the wolves. The pack may attempt to isolate and surround one target if it looks like they can get a quick kill. If their prey poses a formidable threat to the wolves, they are unlikely to attack unless starving or under some supernatural influence. 


##### Combat: Ascendant Packleader
If an ascendant packleader leads the wolf pack, they will operate with a higher level of tactical complexity. They typically initiate combat with their Hunter’s Howl, which not only helps their allies close distance on prey but frightens the prey into running, setting up the chase scenario wolves prefer. They can then use their Bark Orders bonus action during combat to keep their pack mates in the action and focusing on high-priority targets.

#### Retreat

If the wolves do engage in combat, they will usually be quick to flee if it appears the tide is turning against them. Any individual wolf is likely to flee once it loses 10 percent of its health unless it is desperately hungry, in which case it may fight until it has lost 50 to 60 percent of its health. If half or more of a wolf pack has fled and their opponents still appear to be in fighting condition, the remaining wolves will typically retreat.

##### Retreat: Ascendant Packleader
Wolves being led by an ascendant packleader will often fight to the death so long as their leader commands them. The packleader will usually call for a retreat if the pack is losing the fight unless doing so would violate their sacred duty. If the packleader is slain, the wolves may go mad and attempt to avenge its death or revert to acting like normal wolves and retreat.

## Wolf Loot Guide
Wolves generally won’t carry items, so most of their loot will take the form of whatever can be harvested from their bodies.

### Lootable Wolf Items
The following table lists the types of materials likely to be harvested from wolves and the suggested skills your players can use to attempt their harvest.  If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

#####  Wolf Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
|  Hide  |Dexterity (Leatherworker's Tools) or Wisdom (Survival) |
|  Flesh | Dexterity (Cook's Utensils) or Wisdom (Survival)  | 
|  Blood or Bone | Intelligence (Medicine) or Wisdom (Survival)  |  



<br>The number of items harvested and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their harvesting check. You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names.




\columnbreak


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Hide |Flesh | Blood | Bones |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  5sp  | Tattered Wolf Pelt | Stringy Wolf Meat  | Clotted Wolf Blood | Fractured Wolf Bones | 
|  1gp |  Wolf Pelt |  Wolf Meat  | Wolf Blood | Wolf Bones |
|  5gp | Pristine Wolf Pelt |  Wolf Heart  | Pristine Wolf Blood | Pristine Wolf Bones |
|  10gp| Runic Wolf Pelt |  Primeval Wolf Heart  | Primeval Wolf Blood | Runic Wolf Bones |



### Wolf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to harvest depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're harvesting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time. 

If you don't want to require a check on the part of the players, you can instead roll a d20 with the modifier determined by the table to determine what the players find randomly.




##### Wolf & Dire Wolf Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3  |  Wolf Loot |  Dire Wolf Loot |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
|  1-5  | Nothing | Nothing  |
|  6-12 | 1 5sp Item |  1d4(2) 5sp Items  |
|  13-16 | 2d6(7) 5sp Items |  1d6(3) 1gp Items |
|  17-20 | 2d6(7) 1gp Items |  2d6(7) 1gp Items |
|  21+ | 1d6(3) 5gp Items |  2d4(5) 5gp Items | 

##### Ascendant Packleader Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5  | Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|:---:|
