## Mountain Birds
### Condors
Condors are among the largest flying birds in the <br> world, often reaching lengths of up to 4.5 feet and <br> sporting wingspans that can reach up to 10 feet. <br> Their appearance is similar to that of vultures, <br> with feathers that are a mix of black and other <br> colors and heads and necks devoid of feathers. 

Condors are known for their extraordinary flight <br> abilities. They use thermal updrafts to soar and <br> glide through the air, often for hours, without <br> flapping their wings. This helps them conserve <br> energy as they soar at heights of up to 15,000 feet. <br> They have a keen eyesight which allows them to <br> spot potential food from high altitudes.
Condors <br> are scavengers, feeding mostly on the carcasses <br> of dead animals. They play an important role in <br> their ecosystems by helping to get rid of decaying <br> matter. Their extremely strong stomach acid helps <br> them digest this carrion, which can include bones, <br> without getting sick.

These large birds are incredibly adaptable, <br> being able to endure the harsh conditions of high <br> mountain peaks as well as rugged badland cliffs. <br> Condors often feature prominently in the legends <br> of mountain dwelling humanoid tribes. Their ability <br> to soar among the mountain tops is associated with <br> a divine status, and many consider condors <br> messengers serving the gods on high.

Condors seldom have any reason to attack <br> humanoids unless threatened. However, mountain <br> dwelling druids or gods associated with condors <br> may use them as sentries among the peaks. Such <br> condors may even be persuaded to attack intruders <br> with beak and claw. Though they will usually wait <br> until their foes are distracted by other combatants <br> or on dangerous high terrain before they make <br> their attack.

### Argentavis
Argentavis is an ancient species of bird and thought to be one of the largest flying birds that has ever lived. Its body reaches 12 feet in length, and its massive wingspan stretches out to 20 feet. This colossal bird, as mighty as it is magnificent, relies heavily on thermal soaring for flight. Like the smaller condor cousins, the argentavis capitalizes on the warm, rising air currents to traverse vast distances, flapping its enormous wings sparingly to conserve energy. Its takeoff involves a wind-assisted run combined with a leaping motion, showcasing the bird's immense strength and agility.

Yet, the argentavis is not just an accomplished aviator, but a ruthless scavenger. The large, hooked beak, reminiscent of an executioner's blade, is perfectly adapted for tearing into the flesh of the fallen. When the argentavis descends onto a carcass, other scavengers are wise to yield, for contesting the massive bird’s claim could invite the wrath of its razor-sharp talons.

Many believe agentavis to be long extinct, leaving behind only fossils and ancient legends. However, some believe they still soar within primeval mountains cut off from civilization, feasting on the remains of mighty beasts and would-be explorers. Others believe those that remain act in service of demi-gods who rule their domains from the highest peaks.

#### Dread Argentavis
Though the argentavis is assumed to be the largest “natural” bird to have lived, some believe that an even larger variant referenced in ancient legends may still exist. Referred to as the dread argentavis, this massive creature does indeed soar over long forgotten mountain ranges, its shadow casting an ominous pall over the landscape below. 

As wide as a longship's sail and black as onyx, its wings spread across the sky, a silent and foreboding symbol of power. This colossal avian creature, standing taller than the mightiest warhorse and with a wingspan greater than 30 feet, is the stuff of legends.

The dread argentavis, also known as the "Titan of the Skies", possesses a fearsome visage. Its glossy black feathers shimmer in the sunlight as it soars effortlessly on thermal currents. A large hooked beak is perfect for tearing apart carrion or intimidating potential rivals. Its eyes, like twin orbs of polished obsidian, are sharp and discerning, capable of spotting a rabbit scurrying in the underbrush from thousands of feet above.

However, the dread argentavis, for all its might, does not prey on the living. It is the ultimate scavenger, preferring to feed upon the carcasses of fallen beasts. Its deadly beak an massive talons are used to drive off other creatures that would challenge its right to the carrion of its choice, and many headstrong adventurers have suffered the consequences of challenging the dread argentavis’s claims.

### Condor & Argentavis Adventure Hooks
| d6  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Condor's Feather:** A local apothecary needs a feather from a condor to complete a powerful healing elixir. The problem is, condors are found only in the highest, most treacherous mountains. Can the party navigate the dangerous peaks, outwit any mountainous threats, and get close enough to a condor to acquire a feather without harming the bird?|
|  2  |**The Condor’s Eye:** A famed explorer has discovered a rare gemstone known as the "Condor’s Eye" in a distant land. However, it's said that removing the gemstone would anger the spirits of the condors protecting it. True enough, the city where the gemstone is displayed is now plagued by aggressive condors, attacking citizens and causing chaos. The party is hired to safely return the Condor’s Eye and placate the angry spirits. |
|  3  |**Roost of the Silver King:** Legends tell of an ancient argentavis, known as The Silver King, whose roost was hidden in the mountains. It's believed to have collected shiny objects, including a powerful magical artifact lost to time. The adventurers stumble upon a partial map to this roost and decide to seek out the treasure. Little do they know, the Silver King's decendants still fiercely protect the roost.|
|  4  |**The Peak-Top Raiders:** A tribe of mountain-dwelling goblins have somehow tamed several argentavis and are using them to harass and attack the nearby settlements. The local lord seeks the party's help in dealing with the aerial menace and ending the goblin threat.|
|  5  |**Argentavis Rampage:** A massive dread argentavis has begun terrorizing a mountain region, disrupting trade routes and causing havoc. The adventurers are hired to deal with the problem. However, once they arrive, they discover that a spiteful druid is enraging the creature. |
|  6  | **The Aerial Tournament:** The kingdom is hosting an aerial racing tournament, and the prize is an dread argentavis as a mount. The competition is fierce, with many powerful figures interested in winning.  |

### Condor and Argentavis Tactics
These birds are primarily scavengers and will generally avoid combat when able. If they've been compelled to combat other creatures, they will stick to a basic strategy of using their claw and talon attacks against isolated targets to avoid being surrounded. If they are surrounded, they will generally disengage and take to the air. If targets are near a ledge, they may attempt to shove them off.

### Condor & Argentavis Loot
The valuable items looted from mountain birds will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
