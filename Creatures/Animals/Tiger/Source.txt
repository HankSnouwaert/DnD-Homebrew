# Tigers
The largest and deadliest of all cats, <br> tigers are the kings of their domain. <br> Their power and beauty elevate <br> them to an almost mythical status <br> amongst many humanoids.  Some <br> view them as the wrath of the gods <br> made flesh, while others see them <br> as the ultimate predators against which one can <br> truly test their metal. 

***Predators Supreme.*** Tigers can reach over 10 <br>  feet in length, and their intensely muscular bodies <br> can weigh nearly 700 pounds.  Due to their sheer <br> mass and power, few creatures are safe from a <br> tiger's predation. Thanks to the tiger's striped <br> camouflage and long pouncing distances, even animals <br> large and powerful enough to pose a threat to a tiger rarely notice it in time to mount an effective defense. Thanks to their deadly ambush capabilities, tigers can hunt down larger creatures as dangerous as mountain gorillas and even brown bears.  

Once a tiger surprises its prey with a pounce, it will knock its victim prone and use its claws and teeth to lock down and quickly finish the kill.   A prone victim has little chance of fighting back and is rapidly ripped apart before being dragged off by the tiger to be consumed. 

***Maneaters.*** While tigers primarily hunt animals living across jungles, forests, and occasionally mountains, they often hunt stray humanoids when the opportunity presents itself. A lone traveling humanoid will usually be seen as an easy meal to a tiger, and some may even be bold enough to attempt to pick off a humanoid traveling with a group.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some notorious tigers take a personal liking toward hunting humanoids. A tiger that has been "wronged"  by someone will often make a point of hunting down and exacting vengeance upon the offender. These offenders are usually individuals who injured the tiger in a previous encounter or stole one of its kills. Other tigers will decide to make humanoids their primary prey.   These tigers will stalk the outskirts of isolated villages and pick off stray inhabitants, leaving the population terror-stricken.

&emsp;***Dire Tigers.*** These primeval terrors represent the dangerous aspects of the tiger amplified to a greater level of deadliness.  They are larger and more muscular than other tigers, reaching nearly 900 pounds.  They are bolder than other tigers and attack humanoids without hesitation, even those traveling in groups.  They are more resilient than other tigers, and even groups of veteran hunters often fail to slay these mighty beasts.

Many believe dire tigers to be the ancient cousins of "modern tigers" and remnants from a long-lost age.  Whatever their origin, they are often put to use by other beings who wish to punish or test the metal of humanoid adventurers.  Druids enlist the aid of dire tigers to protect their realms from unwanted incursions, and divine forces may unleash dire tigers upon mortals as a form of deadly punishment for their transgressions.

## Weretigers
These lycanthropes blend the hunting <br> prowess of a tiger with the intelligence <br> and versatility of a humanoid, creating <br> proud individuals who view themselves <br> as apex hunters.  
While not evil by nature, weretigers often have a <br> superiority complex that drives them to hunt all <br> manner of dangerous game to demonstrate <br> their place at the top of the food chain.  This <br> hunting is done with a detached refinement, and <br> weretigers will rarely revert to their bestial forms <br> if they can help it, preferring to remain calm and in control.  

Though weretigers become frustrated when pushed to the point of losing their cool and transforming into their bestial forms, deep down, they crave the challenge.  While a weretiger may take smug satisfaction from easily dispatching dangerous prey, a true challenge that pushes the limits of its abilities will be a treasured victory.  

Weretigers are also very careful about who they pass their lycanthropy to, as they view it as a privilege and a burden.  Weretigers have an exclusivist attitude and are loath to introduce unnecessary and unworthy competition.  

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

However, when weretigers find exceptional hunters or even humanoid prey that exceed their expectations, they may choose to pass their lycanthropy onto such individuals, thereby creating worthy rivals for future competitions.
