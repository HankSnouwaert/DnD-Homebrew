## The Ursine Shrine  <br> (Player Level: 12-14)
In this encounter, the players enter an icy shrine dedicated to an ancient ursine god, where they summon a massive elemental bear to do battle with.

### Encounter Context
There are many reasons the players could be here to summon the bear. This may be a test to prove themselves worthy before the ursine god so they can acquire its blessing or ancient knowledge, or this shrine may be the source of a curse plunging the land into eternal winter, which the players must manifest into the elemental bear so they can destroy it.

### Lead Up
The encounter begins when the players enter the chamber. A voice echoes across the ice, warning them to turn back. If they don't heed the warning, the elemental bear is summoned within the chamber, and the encounter begins. At this point, the voice will inform the players that should any of them flee the chamber, their challenge will be forfeited, and they will lose the chance to accomplish whatever they came here for.

### The Bear's Tactics
The default version of this encounter assumes you are using a standard elemental bear. But, for easier or harder encounters, you may use a different type of bear. The following are general tactics for each type.

#### Ice Bear Tactics
Ice bears initiate combat by unleashing their ice wave ability and then targeting the physically weakest opponent restrained by the ice. If the ice bear isn't being controlled by another force, it will withdraw from combat if it fails to restrain any targets with its ice wave, or it loses half or more of its hit points within the first round.

#### Elemental Bear Tactics
Here are some things to keep in mind when using elemental bears:
* They are front-line fighters useful for tanking and crowd control
* Their Aura of Winter ability disrupts ranged attackers. So, elemental bears should try to close the distance with such enemies
* Ice Wave is its best opening move, followed by a bite attack on any restrained target
* Breath of Hail is a good follow-up move for the turn after Ice Wave is used since you can target everyone who's still restrained.
* Breath of Hail is also useful for hitting foes who are staying out of range of Ice Wave if the bear can hit three or more enemies.
* Only use Ray of Frost if there is no other way to attack enemies

<br>

#### Avatar of Winter Tactics
Here are some things to keep in mind when using the Avatar of Winter:
* The *heart of winter* spell is its best way of initiating combat, and it will cast it the most critical battlefield area as it isn't affected by the spell's adverse effects.
* The Grasp of Winter legendary action can be used to pull targets back into the area of *heart of winter*.
* The Whirlwind of Frost action should be saved for situations where the bear is either unable to move or able to hit three or more enemies with it (assuming the bear ends up in a favorable location.)

### The Bear's Lair Action
All of the bears have access to the following lair action. The save DC and bludgeoning damage dealt by the lair action depend on the bear.

**Ice Bear:** DC 15, 19 (3d12) bludgeoning damage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Elemental Bear:** DC 19, 26 (4d12) bludgeoning damage
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Avatar of Winter:** DC 20, 32 (5d12) bludgeoning damage

#### Lair Action: Cave In 
On initiative count 20 of the next round (losing initiative ties), a chosen 15-foot square area on the ceiling becomes visibly unstable. On initiative count 20 of the next round, the area collapses, crashing down to the floor below. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 19 (3d12) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a crea

Furthermore, the collapsed area becomes difficult terrain, covered in debris. Clearing each 5-foot-square portion of the area by hand requires at least 1 minute. If the area was previously covered in slick ice, it no longer causes creatures to fall prone while standing or moving through the area.

### Aftermath
The encounter will not end until the bear has been slain or the party has been defeated or has fled. The bear won't pursue the players outside the cave as they automatically lose their chance at achieving their goal if they leave. If the party is defeated, you can choose to have them revived outside the cave by the power of the ursine god (though they still lose the fight.)

#### Loot
You can use the loot tables found later in this document to determine what valuables can be harvested from the bear's remains. If this is the final encounter of an adventure, it would be a good time to award them a treasure hoard appropriate to their level. This would likely consist of valuables and magic items adorning the ursine god's cavern. If they are hear to earn something from the god, then whatever the god awards them should suffice. 

#### XP Award: 20,000xp
This is an all-or-nothing fight, so it's best to award them either the full XP for completing the encounter or little to none of it if they fail.



\columnbreak

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly. 

**Easier Encounter (Level 5-7).** Replace the elemental bear with an ice bear. Change the XP award to 5,000 XP.

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Replace the elemental bear with The Avatar of Winter. Change the XP award to 75,000 XP.

### Adventure Tie Ins
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration. 

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  |**The Artifact Bearer:** The players are on a quest to retrieve a sacred artifact or relic housed within the shrine. To gain access to it, they must prove their worth by facing the guardian bear. |
|  2  | **The Unbearable Winter:** A curse has plunged the lands into a neverending winter. The players must reach the shrine where the curse can be forced into the corporeal form of a bear and thus destroyed.|
|  3  | **A Divine Burden to Bear:** A deity or high priest sends the players on a pilgrimage to the shrine as a test of their faith, courage, or strength. Confronting the elemental bear is the climax of this spiritual journey. |
|  4  | **The Bear's Necessities:** The shrine is in disrepair, and a local tribe or religious group enlists the players' help to bring it the items necessary for its restoration. The bear, however, sees any intruders as threats and must be pacified or defeated.|

If a creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 15), it is dazed until the end of the bear's next turn.
>
> ***Winter's Wrath (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** The bear casts the *heart of winter* spell (described on the next page) without any spell components or requiring Concentration, using Wisdom as its spellcasting modifier (Spell save DC 20). The spell ends only after 1 minute or when the bear dies and cannot be dispelled by spells of 8th level or lower.
> 
> ### Legendary Actions

> **Tenacious Will.** If the bear is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> **Grasp of Winter (Costs 2 Actions).** The bear chooses a creature within 120 feet of it that just took its turn and is not restrained. That creature must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained by a claw of ice that forms around it. A creature can use its action to make a DC 20 Strength check, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 20; hp 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder, bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature isn't restrained. At the end of each of a creature's turns, while restrained by the ice, it is pulled 30 feet towards the bear or the center of its *heart of winter* spell if it is active (bear's choice).
>
> **Whirlwind of Frost (Costs 2 Actions).** The bear magically transforms into a whirlwind of ice, moves up to 60 feet, and reverts to its normal form. While in whirlwind form, the bear is immune to all damage and under the effects of the *gaseous form* spell. If it passes through another creature's space during this movement, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 14 (4d6) cold damage.

#### New Spell: Soul of Winter
*9th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (sapphire worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

A 30-foot-radius sphere of whirling sub-zero cold springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. 

**Creatures In the Sphere When It's First Cast.** Each creature in the sphere, when it first appears, must succeed on a Strength saving. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 cold damage and is restrained by ice for 1 minute. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

**Icy Surfaces.** The surfaces within the sphere are coated in ice, making any ground in the area difficult terrain for one minute. The first time each turn that a creature either moves into or out of any difficult terrain created by the spell, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. 

**Creatures Ending Their Turn In The Sphere.** Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way.

**The Spell's End.** When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the ice in the sphere shatters in an explosion. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes piercing damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell's base damage is 2d8. At the end of each of your subsequent turns after the spell has been cast, if the sphere has not yet exploded, the damage increases by 2d8.

### Arctic Bear Loot

The valuable items looted from bears will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Being elementals, most of an elemental bear's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the snow and dirt it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Arctic Bears Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
