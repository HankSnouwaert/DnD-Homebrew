## Arctic Bears

### Polar Bears

In the frigid expanses of the northern realms, the polar bear stands as a majestic and formidable hunter. These colossal beasts, robed in shimmering coats of snow-white fur, are the undisputed sovereigns of their icy domain. Adult males, towering and robust, can weigh as much as 700 kg, with females being notably smaller yet equally impressive.

Blessed with a thick layer of fat and a dense, water-repellent fur, these giants are insulated against the harshest of colds. Their bodies are so adept at retaining heat that the challenge often lies in staying cool rather than warm. With large, partially webbed front paws, Polar Bears are skilled swimmers, capable of traversing vast and treacherous waters. They are known to journey tirelessly across the seas, navigating the chilling waters with ease.

As apex predators, they primarily feast upon the seals that dwell in the same icy waters. They employ a cunning mix of patience and stealth, utilizing the sea ice as their hunting grounds to outwit their prey. Equipped with a remarkably acute sense of smell, polar bears can detect the faintest scent of a seal from a mile away, even under layers of snow and ice. Their vision and hearing, on par with humans, further enhance their hunting prowess. Should any humanoid adventurers venture into their icy domains, polar bears won't hesitate to employ the same hunting tactics against the unfortunate travelers.

#### Tyrant Polar Bears
These primeval bears are larger and more robust than their 'modern' descendants. Thought to be extinct by most, some of these lone monsters still roam remote arctic wastelands where they hunt other large megafauna, spilling blood across the ice as they assert their rulership over this brutal domain. Tundra-dwelling humanoids may venerate these creatures as servants of the gods, and spiritual

### Ice Bears
These colossal creatures, resembling ordinary polar bears, are endowed with a mystical frost that seems to weave into their very being. Their fur, shimmering with a pale blue hue, glistens like the heart of a glacier, while their eyes gleam with the cold light of the aurora.

The origin of these majestic beasts is shrouded in mystery. Some say they are the children of the winter gods, blessed or cursed with their icy might. Others believe they are polar bears transformed by a powerful sorcery, their forms infused with the essence of the eternal frost. Regardless of their origins, their supernatural nature is unmistakable. 

The ice bears possess a remarkable ability to radiate an aura of frost, a chilling presence that seeps into the bones of any creature daring enough to come close. This aura not only slows down their prey, making escape difficult, but also serves as a shield, warding off those who might challenge these titans.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

In the heat of battle or when hunting, they can unleash a formidable wave of cold, a blast of freezing energy that envelops their surroundings. This wave can root their prey in place, encased in a sheath of ice, helpless against the might of the Ice Bear.

While these bears are known to hunt the typical fauna of their frozen homes, they have also earned a fearsome reputation for preying on humanoid hunters and frontiersmen who venture too far into their domain. Their attacks are swift and devastating, leaving little more than ice-covered remnants in their wake.

Despite their ferocity and mystical nature, there are tales of these mighty beasts being captured and tamed. In the hands of a skilled beastmaster, an Ice Bear can become a formidable beast of war, its natural abilities harnessed for battle. The sight of an armored Ice Bear charging into the fray, its breath frosting the air, is enough to shake the resolve of even the bravest warriors.

### Elemental Bears
These gargantuan elementals, born from the very essence of the arctic lands, take on the formidable forms of massive polar bears, embodying the raw, unbridled spirit of their frigid homelands.

With bodies sculpted from ice and snow, these majestic beings are more than mere animals; they are the personification of the arctic wilderness. Their fur seems to be made of frost and icicles, shimmering with the pale light of the winter sun. Their eyes, deep and piercing, reflect the endless skies of their frozen realms. These Elemental Bears do not just inhabit the Arctic; they are the Arctic, its protectors and avatars.

Their primary purpose is deeply ingrained in their icy souls â€“ to guard their homelands from any threat. These guardians are fiercely territorial, confronting any who dare to disrupt the delicate balance of their icy domains. 

They are not just animals; they are the embodiment of the Arctic's will, its defenders against the encroachment of outsiders and the despoiling of their pristine landscapes.

Surrounded by an eternal maelstrom of winter winds, Elemental Bears command the very essence of cold and ice. They can breathe cones of icy hail, turning foes into frozen statues. With a roar that echoes across the tundra, they can unleash waves of ice from their massive bodies, capable of freezing everything in their path, creating landscapes of glacial beauty and deadly stillness.

#### The Avatar of Winter

Among these elemental titans, there exists a being of extraordinary power, known in whispered tales as the Avatar of Winter. This elemental bear is revered as a demi-god, a manifestation of the winter season itself. Larger, more powerful, and more ancient than its kin, the Avatar of Winter is a force of nature personified, capable of summoning blizzards and shaping the very ice at will.

On a failed save, it is restrained by a claw of ice that forms around it. A creature can use its action to make a DC 20 Strength check, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 20; hp 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder, bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature isn't restrained. At the end of each of a creature's turns, while restrained by the ice, it is pulled 30 feet towards the bear or the center of its *heart of winter* spell if it is active (bear's choice).

#### New Spell: Soul of Winter
*9th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (sapphire worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

A 30-foot-radius sphere of whirling sub-zero cold springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. 

**Creatures In the Sphere When It's First Cast.** Each creature in the sphere, when it first appears, must succeed on a Strength saving. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 cold damage and is restrained by ice for 1 minute. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

**Icy Surfaces.** The surfaces within the sphere are coated in ice, making any ground in the area difficult terrain for one minute. The first time each turn that a creature either moves into or out of any difficult terrain created by the spell, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. 

**Creatures Ending Their Turn In The Sphere.** Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way.

**The Spell's End.** When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the ice in the sphere shatters in an explosion. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes piercing damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on <br> a successful one. The spell's base damage is 2d8. <br> At the end of each of your subsequent turns after <br> the spell has been cast, if the sphere has not yet <br> exploded, the damage increases by 2d8.

### Arctic Bear Tactics
Polar bears have very straightforward attack patterns that mostly involve charging straight at their prey. If they're not under the control of an external force, they will retreat when reduced to half health or lower or if it becomes obvious they are outmatched.

The supernatural arctic bears have more complex tactics, as detailed below.

Ice bears initiate combat by unleashing their ice wave ability and then targeting the physically weakest opponent restrained by the ice. If the ice bear isn't being controlled by another force, it will withdraw from combat if it fails to restrain any targets with its ice wave, or it loses half or more of its hit points within the first round.

#### Elemental Bear Tactics
Here are some things to keep in mind when using elemental bears:
* They are front-line fighters useful for tanking and crowd control
* Their Aura of Winter ability disrupts ranged attackers. So, elemental bears should try to close the distance with such enemies
* Ice Wave is its best opening move, followed by a bite attack on any restrained target
* Breath of Hail is a good follow-up move for the turn after Ice Wave is used since you can target everyone who's still restrained.
 * Breath of Hail is also useful for hitting foes who are staying out of range of Ice Wave if the bear can hit three or more enemies.
* Only use Ray of Frost if there is no other way to attack enemies

#### Avatar of Winter Tactics
Here are some things to keep in mind when using the Avatar of Winter:
* The *heart of winter* spell is its best way of initiating combat, and it will cast it the most critical battlefield area as it isn't affected by the spell's adverse effects.
* The Grasp of Winter legendary action can be used to pull targets back into the area of *heart of winter*.
* The Whirlwind of Frost action should be saved for situations where the bear is either unable to move or able to hit three or more enemies with it (assuming the bear ends up in a favorable location.)

### Arctic Bear Loot

The valuable items looted from bears will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Being elementals, most of an elemental bear's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the snow and dirt it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Arctic Bears Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
