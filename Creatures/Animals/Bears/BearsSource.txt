## Bears 

 Bears are a symbol of strength and resilience, <br> captivating the imagination of humanoids across many cultures with their formidable presence and diverse range <br> of habitats. Known for their significant physical power, bears can take down large prey and defend themselves against most threats. Their thick fur and robust frames make them durable and allow them to withstand harsh conditions and engage in long pursuits.

Despite their substantial size, bears possess an unexpected speed and navigational versatility, enabling them to traverse challenging terrains, climb, and swim with remarkable proficiency. This agility complements their physical might, making them adept at catching swift prey or evading dangers in their natural habitats. Moreover, bears are equipped with keen senses, particularly an exceptional sense of smell, which aids them in tracking down food, sensing danger, and navigating their environment with an acute awareness.

Bears also display notable intelligence and problem-solving skills, especially when foraging for food or navigating obstacles. This cognitive ability, combined with their capacity to learn from experiences, highlights their adaptability and interaction with their surroundings in innovative ways.

Adaptable to a wide range of environments, from arctic tundras to dense forests and mountainous regions, bears exemplify versatility and resilience. Their ability to thrive in various terrains speaks to their remarkable adaptability, ensuring their survival and prominence in the animal kingdom. The characteristics of bears, from their strength and agility to their intelligence and adaptability, make them awe-inspiring and deeply respected by those living in the wilder parts of the world.

The following are examples of different types of bears across a variety of sizes and power levels. Though it's not a comprehensive list of every type of bear, most other types could still be represented using the stat block of one of the bears presented here.

### Sun Bears

Sun bears, known to some as the 'honey bear' due to their affinity for honey, are the most diminutive members of the bear family. They possess a distinctive fur pattern with sleek, black fur and a unique, sun-like chest patch that varies in color from cream to a ruddy orange. These bears are creatures of the shadows and the canopies, thriving in the dense forest environments of their mystical realms.

Gifted with an unusually long tongue, which they use with finesse to extract honey and insects from the most intricate places, sun bears are also equipped with powerful jaws and sizable canines. These traits allow them to break into tough exteriors, be it for harvesting honey or seeking out the larvae nestled within the bark of trees. 

Nocturnal by nature, sun bears lead a reclusive life, shying away from the bustling world below. They are adept climbers, with sharp claws that make them as comfortable in the boughs of trees as on the ground. These bears, while usually peaceful, can demonstrate impressive  ferocity, especially when defending their young or when they feel threatened.

### Spectacled Bears

Spectacled bears derive their name from the unique mask-like rings of fur that encircle their eyes, giving the appearance of eyeglasses against their shadowy fur. These medium-sized bears are adept climbers and dwell in the dense and misty reaches of the high forest canopies.

With a predominantly vegetarian diet, spectacled bears are the gardeners of their domain, meticulously selecting fruits and leaves, their choices inadvertently nurturing the flora around them. Their role in the cycle of life is that of a silent cultivator, their movement through the branches sowing the seeds of future groves and orchards. However, when the season calls or opportunity presents, they display an omnivorous side, partaking in a more diverse banquet provided by their rich, verdant world.

Spectacled bears are often found as lone wanderers, traversing their arboreal labyrinth with a measured grace, their powerful limbs allowing them to scale great heights with ease. These bears are not commonly aggressive, but when it comes to the protection of their young or their own safety, they exhibit a formidable strength and courage that belies their otherwise gentle nature.

### Black Bears
Black bears, with their lustrous dark fur and imposing stature, wander the expansive wilds of their domain, a testament to their versatility and adaptability. These creatures are known to inhabit various enclaves of the wilderness, from deep, shadowed woods to the edges of vast and silent glades. While their fur is commonly as dark as night, some boast coats of cinnamon or even white, hinting at the rich diversity among their kind. This diversity is not merely cosmetic; it is a sign of a multitude of subspecies, each adapted to its unique corner of the natural world.

These bears are omnivorous, with a diet as varied as the lands they roam. They forage with an opportunistic zeal, partaking in nature's bounty from berry bush to honeycomb.

But, when the situation calls for it, they can hunt with a surprising combination of stealth and power.

Their keen intelligence and curiosity often lead them to explore and sometimes even manipulate their environments in search of sustenance or shelter.

In terms of demeanor, black bears are generally shy around other humanoids, often displaying a peaceful disposition. However, they possess a fierce protective instinct, especially when it comes to their offspring or when they are surprised and feel threatened, and in such cases, they can demonstrate the full force of their natural prowess. Their strength, coupled with sharp instincts, makes them respected by all who share their territory.

### Brown Bears
Brown bears are the stalwarts of the wilderness, with a range of fur colors that blend into the varied landscapes they inhabit. These large and powerful animals are found in numerous regions, each home to distinct subspecies with their own unique adaptations. Their diet is as broad as their habitat, consisting of fruits, nuts, fish, and small mammals, showcasing their omnivorous nature. 

While brown bears typically lead solitary lives, they may gather in numbers in areas of abundant food like a rich salmon run. They have a complex social structure that becomes apparent during these gatherings, where hierarchies are observed and occasionally contested. Despite their solitary nature, mothers are fiercely protective of their cubs, teaching them essential survival skills.

As winter approaches, brown bears enter a phase of intense eating known as hyperphagia to prepare for hibernation, significantly increasing their food intake to build fat reserves. This crucial period heightens their aggression as the drive to feed becomes paramount. Bears are more likely to encounter others during this time, defending their food sources fiercely. The necessity to fatten up can make them more dangerous, as they prioritize feeding over avoiding conflict, posing increased risks to themselves and others.

#### Grizzly Bears
The large and ferocious subspecies known as grizzly bears have captured the awe of those who share or venture into their territories. Their more aggressive nature is often a result of the fierce competition for resources and the need to defend their space. They are slightly larger than most other brown bears and have a distinct hump on their shoulders, a feature that highlights their powerful forelimbs and their ability to dig and forage. Grizzlies are particularly known for their impressive physical capabilities and can often be more aggressive and dangerous, especially when surprised or when they are with their cubs. Some grizzlies become brazen hunters, willing to attack humanoids without provocation. This has made them among the most feared animals by those traveling through remote wilds.

### Polar Bears

In the frigid expanses of the northern realms, the polar bear stands as a majestic and formidable hunter. These colossal beasts, robed in shimmering coats of snow-white fur, are the undisputed sovereigns of their icy domain. Adult males, towering and robust, can weigh as much as 700 kg, with females being notably smaller yet equally impressive.

Blessed with a thick layer of fat and a dense, water-repellent fur, these giants are insulated against the harshest of colds. Their bodies are so adept at retaining heat that the challenge often lies in staying cool rather than warm. With large, partially webbed front paws, Polar Bears are skilled swimmers, capable of traversing vast and treacherous waters. They are known to journey tirelessly across the seas, navigating the chilling waters with ease.

As apex predators, they primarily feast upon the seals that dwell in the same icy waters. They employ a cunning mix of patience and stealth, utilizing the sea ice as their hunting grounds to outwit their prey. Equipped with a remarkably acute sense of smell, polar bears can detect the faintest scent of a seal from a mile away, even under layers of snow and ice. Their vision and hearing, on par with humans, further enhance their hunting prowess. Should any humanoid adventurers venture into their icy domains, polar bears won't hesitate to employ the same hunting tactics against the unfortunate travelers.

#### Tyrant Polar Bears
These primeval bears are larger and more robust than their 'modern' descendants. Thought to be extinct by most, some of these lone monsters still roam remote arctic wastelands where they hunt other large megafauna, spilling blood across the ice as they assert their rulership over this brutal domain. Tundra-dwelling humanoids may venerate these creatures as servants of the gods, and spiritual

### Arctotheriums

Arctotherium, the ancient primeval bear known as the short-faced bear, stands as a towering figure in the annals of natural history. These bears are characterized by their expansive chests and shortened snouts, a distinct feature from which they derive their name. Despite their formidable size, they are agile, capable of covering ground swiftly, a trait that serves them well in their pursuit of prey and sustenance.

These primeval creatures are omnivorous, with a preference for large meals to support their massive builds. Their diets are adaptable, consisting of anything the land offers, from vegetation to larger game. Arctotherium's powerful forelimbs and strong jaws are their primary tools, enabling them to hunt effectively and scavenge from others when the opportunity arises.

Arctotherium are typically solitary, with each bear maintaining a large territory that overlaps with others only occasionally. These territories are the stages upon which they silently enact their daily rituals of foraging, hunting, and roaming. Interaction between these ancient bears is rare, limited to necessary engagements such as mating or competing for resources.

Though often spoken of as relics of a bygone era, arctotheriums are still rumored to roam the remote and wild recesses of the world. They may be found deep in primeval forests, guarding ancient shrines dedicated to ursine gods, or in the service of powerful druids. Adventurers who stumble upon such beasts do well not to anger them, for the arctotheriums's power and ferocity is far beyond that of any other bear they will have faced.

### Ice Bears
These colossal creatures, resembling ordinary polar bears, are endowed with a mystical frost that seems to weave into their very being. Their fur, shimmering with a pale blue hue, glistens like the heart of a glacier, while their eyes gleam with the cold light of the aurora.

The origin of these majestic beasts is shrouded in mystery. Some say they are the children of the winter gods, blessed or cursed with their icy might. Others believe they are polar bears transformed by a powerful sorcery, their forms infused with the essence of the eternal frost. Regardless of their origins, their supernatural nature is unmistakable. 

The ice bears possess a remarkable ability to radiate an aura of frost, a chilling presence that seeps into the bones of any creature daring enough to come close. This aura not only slows down their prey, making escape difficult, but also serves as a shield, warding off those who might challenge these titans.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

In the heat of battle or when hunting, they can unleash a formidable wave of cold, a blast of freezing energy that envelops their surroundings. This wave can root their prey in place, encased in a sheath of ice, helpless against the might of the Ice Bear.

While these bears are known to hunt the typical fauna of their frozen homes, they have also earned a fearsome reputation for preying on humanoid hunters and frontiersmen who venture too far into their domain. Their attacks are swift and devastating, leaving little more than ice-covered remnants in their wake.

Despite their ferocity and mystical nature, there are tales of these mighty beasts being captured and tamed. In the hands of a skilled beastmaster, an Ice Bear can become a formidable beast of war, its natural abilities harnessed for battle. The sight of an armored Ice Bear charging into the fray, its breath frosting the air, is enough to shake the resolve of even the bravest warriors.

### Elemental Bears
These gargantuan elementals, born from the very essence of the arctic lands, take on the formidable forms of massive polar bears, embodying the raw, unbridled spirit of their frigid homelands.

With bodies sculpted from ice and snow, these majestic beings are more than mere animals; they are the personification of the arctic wilderness. Their fur seems to be made of frost and icicles, shimmering with the pale light of the winter sun. Their eyes, deep and piercing, reflect the endless skies of their frozen realms. These Elemental Bears do not just inhabit the Arctic; they are the Arctic, its protectors and avatars.

Their primary purpose is deeply ingrained in their icy souls – to guard their homelands from any threat. These guardians are fiercely territorial, confronting any who dare to disrupt the delicate balance of their icy domains. 

They are not just animals; they are the embodiment of the Arctic's will, its defenders against the encroachment of outsiders and the despoiling of their pristine landscapes.

Surrounded by an eternal maelstrom of winter winds, Elemental Bears command the very essence of cold and ice. They can breathe cones of icy hail, turning foes into frozen statues. With a roar that echoes across the tundra, they can unleash waves of ice from their massive bodies, capable of freezing everything in their path, creating landscapes of glacial beauty and deadly stillness.

#### The Avatar of Winter

Among these elemental titans, there exists a being of extraordinary power, known in whispered tales as the Avatar of Winter. This elemental bear is revered as a demi-god, a manifestation of the winter season itself. Larger, more powerful, and more ancient than its kin, the Avatar of Winter is a force of nature personified, capable of summoning blizzards and shaping the very ice at will.

#### New Spell: Soul of Winter
*9th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (sapphire worth 100 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

A 30-foot-radius sphere of whirling sub-zero cold springs into existence centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere remains for the spell's duration. 

**Creatures In the Sphere When It's First Cast.** Each creature in the sphere, when it first appears, must succeed on a Strength saving. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 cold damage and is restrained by ice for 1 minute. It or another creature within reach of it can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save, shattering the ice on a success. The ice can also be attacked and destroyed (AC equal to your spell save; HP 20; vulnerability to fire, thunder bludgeoning damage; immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage). On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't restrained.

**Icy Surfaces.** The surfaces within the sphere are coated in ice, making any ground in the area difficult terrain for one minute. The first time each turn that a creature either moves into or out of any difficult terrain created by the spell, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone. 

**Creatures Ending Their Turn In The Sphere.** Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 5d8 cold damage and suffers one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and does not suffer a level of exhaustion. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain exhaustion this way.

**The Spell's End.** When the spell ends, either because your concentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the ice in the sphere shatters in an explosion. Each creature in the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes piercing damage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The spell's base damage is 2d8. At the end of each of your subsequent turns after the spell has been cast, if the sphere has not yet exploded, the damage increases by 2d8.

### Bear Tactics
Bears have very straightforward attack patterns that mostly involve charging straight at their prey. If they're not under the control of an external force, they will retreat when reduced to half health or lower or if it becomes obvious they are outmatched.

The supernatural bears have more complex tactics, as detailed below.

#### Ice Bear Tactics
Ice bears initiate combat by unleashing their ice wave ability and then targeting the physically weakest opponent restrained by the ice. If the ice bear isn't being controlled by another force, it will withdraw from combat if it fails to restrain any targets with its ice wave, or it loses half or more of its hit points within the first round.

#### Elemental Bear Tactics
Here are some things to keep in mind when using elemental bears:
* They are front-line fighters useful for tanking and crowd control
* Their Aura of Winter ability disrupts ranged attackers. So, elemental bears should try to close the distance with such enemies
* Ice Wave is its best opening move, followed by a bite attack on any restrained target
* Breath of Hail is a good follow-up move for the turn after Ice Wave is used since you can target everyone who's still restrained.
 * Breath of Hail is also useful for hitting foes who are staying out of range of Ice Wave if the bear can hit three or more enemies.
* Only use Frigid Bolt if there is no other way to attack enemies

#### Avatar of Winter Tactics
Here are some things to keep in mind when using the Avatar of Winter:
* The *soul of winter* spell is its best way of initiating combat, and it will cast it the most critical battlefield area as it isn't affected by the spell's adverse effects.
* The Claw of Ice with Grasp of Winter legendary actions can be used to pull targets back into the area of *soul of winter*.
* The Whirlwind of Frost action should be saved for situations where the bear is either unable to move or able to hit three or more enemies with it (assuming the bear ends up in a favorable location.)

### Bear Loot

The valuable items looted from bears will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide.

Being elementals, most of an elemental bear's form will disintegrate when it is destroyed. Players can loot the snow and dirt it leaves behind to find objects still holding some vestiges of its power. This can be done with an **Intelligence (Nature)** or **Wisdom (Nature)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Bear Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
