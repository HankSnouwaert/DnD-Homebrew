## Werebears
Unlike their more ferocious counterparts, such as werewolves, werebears are known for their gentler and more protective nature, although they are formidable foes when provoked or when the innocent are threatened. They are known for their strength, resilience, and keen senses, traits that serve them well in their role as protectors. Despite their formidable abilities, werebears are typically calm and introspective, preferring to avoid conflict unless necessary.

Werebears are often solitary, but they may form small, tight-knit communities in secluded areas. These communities are deeply connected to nature, living in harmony with the land and often acting as stewards of the wilderness. They have a strong sense of justice and are known to aid travelers in distress or defend rural communities from threats.

Their relationship with other lycanthropes and magical creatures varies. While werebears can be allies with beings sharing their respect for nature, they are often at odds with more malevolent lycanthropes, such as werewolves, who embrace their animalistic side with less restraint.

Werebears can control their transformation, shifting between forms at will, though intense emotions or the full moon can sometimes trigger involuntary changes. In addition to their physical prowess, werebears possess a natural ability to heal quickly and are resistant to most forms of damage, except for those inflicted by silver weapons or fiery attacks.

Werebears view their ability to shift between human and bear forms not as a curse, but as a sacred gift and a duty to nature, which they approach with reverence and responsibility. This gift is shared with great caution and deliberation, usually reserved for individuals who demonstrate a deep respect for the natural world and possess a strong moral compass aligned with the werebear's protective ethos. The act of passing on their condition is considered deeply personal and ritualistic, often accompanied by mentorship to guide the new werebear through their transformation.

### Dream Walkers

Many among those afflicted with the werebear curse seek inner balance, striving to harness their animalistic instincts. These individuals engage in deep, ritualistic meditation, leveraging the bear's innate hibernation ability to enter extended trances for profound inward reflection. After years of such meditative practices, some werebears evolve into beings known as dream walkers.

Dream walkers achieve more than mere peace with their dual nature; they exist as nearly separate entities within the same body, yet without conflict. Instead, both sides pursue common goals in harmony, typically aimed at protecting their homeland. In addition to the standard shape-shifting abilities of werebears, dream walkers can conjure weapons from the Realm of Dreams, which can induce a comatose state upon contact. 

However, their most formidable power is the ability to project their psyche into the real world while sleeping. These projections, one embodying their human aspect and the other their bear form, can act independently and possess the tangibility of any living creature. They vanish only when the werebear awakens or is killed.

The werebear deploys these projections to safeguard its territory while it rests within its sacred den. Yet, this strategy bears risk; should an adversary discover the slumbering werebear with its projections absent, it faces grave peril.

##### Werebear Adventure Hooks 

 d6  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Who Can Prevent Forest Fires?:** A once-peaceful forest, home to a community of werebears, faces an unprecedented crisis as fires break out across its expanse. The werebears suspect malicious intent but are stretched thin, protecting wildlife and assisting in evacuation efforts, so they ask the adventurers to help them find a way to prevent forest fires.|
|  2  | **The Fading Forest:** The ancient forest is dying, and with it, the magical barriers that keep darker forces at bay. Werebears, as guardians of the forest, seek out the adventurers to help investigate the source of the blight. This quest leads them to confront a forgotten evil attempting to break free.|
|  3  |**The Honeybrew Heist:** A famous brewery known for its honeyed ale, supposedly blessed by a forest spirit for its unmatched flavor, is actually exploiting a werebear's territory for rare, magical honey. When the werebear retaliates, the brewery's owner desperately seeks help. |
|  4  | **The Unbearable Curse**: A curse has been laid upon an ancient werebear lineage, causing them to lose control over their transformations and become aggressive. The adventurers are enlisted by a descendant seeking to end the curse.|
| 5  | **The Dreaming Grove:** A rare celestial alignment amplifies the powers of dream walkers, but also makes their sacred groves vulnerable to invasion from nightmare entities. A dream walker werebear seeks the adventurers' aid to fend off these invaders and secure the grove.|
|  6  |**Fragmented Psyche:** Reports of a ghostly bear and a spectral human wandering the forests lead the adventurers to a dream walker werebear whose psyche has been fractured by a traumatic event. The projections are causing unintentional havoc, unable to return to their host. The adventurers must find a way to heal the dream walker's psyche, requiring them to navigate a mindscape of memories and fears. |

> ***Javelin of Dreams (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 30/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (2d6 + 4) psychic damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become drowsy for the next minute. If a creature is already drowsy and it fails the save, it falls unconscious until the drowsiness ends. If it takes any non-psychic damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the drowsy creature, the effect ends.
>
> ***Dream Walk (1/Day).*** The werebear falls unconscious for 8 hours and gains 75 temporary hit points that last until it wakes up. While asleep, its Regeneration feature can't be stopped by psychic or silvered weapons. It wakes up once it loses the temporary hit points, or it can choose to end the sleep at the start of its turn. When the werebear falls asleep, it creates two psychic projections of itself in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of it, one in its bear form and one in its humanoid form. The projections have statistics like those of a werebear in either form, except it lacks this action, the Shapechanger bonus action, and the Regeneration ability. In combat, the projections share the werebear's initiative count, going after the werebear on each round one after another. Each projection remains until it is destroyed or the werebear dies or wakes up. When destroyed, they vanish, leaving no physical trace.

> ##### Projections Without The Werebear
>It is possible that the players may encounter the psychic projections of the werebear before ever seeing the actual werebear itself.  If they do, each projection is a CR 5 creature when not with the werebear.

\columnbreak

> This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
> &#8226; It moves at half speed.<br>
> &#8226; It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
> &#8226; It can't concentrate. <br>

### Werebear Tactics
Werebears are fairly straightforward to use in combat. They will prioritize neutralizing foes that can negate their regeneration and avoid using their bite to prevent their curse from spreading. However, dream walkers have more complex abilities requiring more sophisticated tactics.

#### Dream Walker Tactics

These tactics assume the dream walker has access to its Dream Walk ability, although this might not always be the case. 

##### While Using Dream Walk
Many dream walkers prefer to project their avatars while remaining safely within their dens. In these cases, the players may encounter the projections without the werebear present. 

If the werebear does use Dream Walk while in combat itself, don't use it at the start of the fight since part of its use is to regain hitpoints; wait until the werebear has sustained 30 or more damage.

The primary objective of the projections is to ensure the werebear remains asleep as long as possible, maximizing hit point rejuvenation before needing to awaken. Each projection has specific roles:

**Human Projection:** This avatar focuses on utilizing dream spears against backline spellcasters to prevent them from casting spells.

**Bear Projection:** This avatar concentrates on repelling melee combatants attempting to approach the sleeping werebear.

##### While Awake
If the dream walker isn't using Dream Walk, below are some combat tips to keep in mind:

* Stay in hybrid form.
* Use claw attacks to push back tanks and others blocking movement so the werebear can reach more vulnerable targets.
* Use dream spears to disrupt the concentration of powerful spellcasters.
* Don't use dream spears on targets the werebear wants to eliminate since claws do more damage and attacking a drowsy target just wakes it back up.

### Werebear Loot
Because lycanthropes revert to their humanoid form when they are slain, most of the valuable items players can collect from werebears will be worn items or items dropped nearby. These valuables may include standard coinage. These items can be found using a **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Werebear Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Werebear Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1d4(2) 5gp Items |
|  8-11 | 1d6(3) 5gp Items  | 
|  12-18 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items  |  
|  19-22 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items |
