## Rhinos

Rhinoceroses are massive, thick-skinned beasts found in grasslands, savannas, and dense forests. Equipped with formidable horns for defense, these herbivores primarily feed on grasses, leaves, and shrubs. Despite their bulk, rhinos move with surprising speed and agility. Typically solitary, they come together for mating and rearing young.

Thriving in temperate and tropical regions, rhinos are often found near rivers, lakes, and mud wallows, which help cool them and protect their skin from parasites and sunburn. Their keen sense of smell compensates for poor eyesight, allowing them to detect threats and find food.

Known for their trampling charge, rhinos can knock down and crush foes with devastating force. Their thick hide offers significant protection, making them resistant to natural predators and humanoid hunters alike.
Humanoids encounter rhinos for various reasons. Some hunt them for their valuable horns, leading to conflicts with rangers and druids. In rare cases, domesticated rhinos serve as beasts of burden or war mounts. Gathering resources from rhino habitats can also lead to conflicts, as these territorial creatures will charge intruders.

***Jungle Rhinos.*** Jungle rhinos inhabit dense tropical rainforests, where their smaller size allows them to navigate thick underbrush with surprising agility. These elusive creatures are characterized by their shaggy, reddish-brown hide and solitary nature, often found near secluded water sources deep within the jungle. Unlike their savanna cousins, jungle rhinos have adapted to their environment with a keen sense of hearing and smell, compensating for limited visibility in dense foliage. They primarily feed on leaves, fruits, and bark from a variety of rainforest plants. Humanoids might encounter jungle rhinos while exploring these remote areas, either as part of efforts to study their habitats or in search of rare botanical resources. However, any intrusion into their territory is likely to provoke a fierce defensive response.

***White Rhinos.*** White rhinos are massive, thick-skinned beasts primarily found in vast grasslands and savannas, where they graze on the abundant grasses that dominate these landscapes. These rhinos are distinguished by their broad, square-shaped mouths, which are specially adapted for grazing. White rhinos are generally more social than their forest-dwelling counterparts, often seen in small groups led by a dominant female. Despite their immense size and seemingly cumbersome appearance, they can move swiftly when threatened, reaching impressive speeds to evade danger or charge at potential threats.

These rhinos are highly territorial, using their horns and formidable strength to defend their domain from intruders. Their skin, while tough, is sensitive and requires regular mud wallowing to protect against parasites and sunburn. The keen senses of white rhinos, particularly their sense of smell, play a crucial role in detecting predators and communicating with other rhinos. Their loud snorts and grunts can be heard across the plains, signaling their presence to others nearby.

Humanoids interact with white rhinos for various reasons, including the pursuit of their valuable horns, which are highly prized for their utility and supposed mystical properties. Druids or other naturalists may seek to study and protect these majestic creatures. Occasionally, white rhinos are trained and utilized as formidable beasts of burden or even war mounts, leveraging their immense strength and durability. However, any approach toward these powerful creatures must be made with caution, as their territorial nature and defensive capabilities make them formidable opponents.

If the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the rhino's horn, causing it to be grappled (escape DC 15). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 13 (3d8) piercing damage at the start of each of the rhino's turns, and the rhino can't grapple another creature with its gore.

***Elasmotheriums.***
Elasmotheriums are colossal, thick-furred beasts that once roamed the vast steppes and plains of a bygone era. Towering above most creatures, these majestic rhino-like animals are distinguished by a single, massive horn protruding from their foreheads, often reaching lengths of several feet. This horn, used for defense and digging through snow or soil for roots, is a symbol of their immense strength and dominance. Elasmotheriums are primarily solitary, wandering their territories alone, though they sometimes form small herds during migration periods or in regions with abundant food.

Adapted to colder climates, elasmotheriums possess a dense coat that insulates them against harsh weather, allowing them to thrive in regions where other creatures might struggle. Their diet consists mainly of grasses and hardy shrubs, which they can access even in snowy conditions thanks to their powerful horns and muscular build. Despite their size, elasmotheriums can move with surprising speed, making them formidable when charging at threats or rivals.

Scholars and historians venture into remote regions to study these living relics, hoping to gain insights into ancient times. In some cultures, encountering an elasmotherium is a mystical experience, and these creatures are revered as embodiments of the primeval world. Adventurers often seek them not for conquest but for the honor of witnessing a living piece of history. Attempts to tame them aim to harness their raw, ancient power for extraordinary tasks, though most such attempts are met with devastating failure.

### Rhinoceros Loot
The valuable items looted from rhinos will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a rhino. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Rinoceros Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Cungye

Cungye are vile reflections of unicorns and kirin. Whereas unicorns and kirin are elegant and graceful, nurturing life and healing wherever they tread, cungye are muscle-bound brutes covered in mangy patches of fur and gnarled growths running along their bodies. Each of their powerful, trunk-like limbs ends in twisted claws, which allow them to climb vertical surfaces with startling ease. Their most notable feature is the massive black ivory horn on their head. In stark contrast to the healing powers of their celestial counterparts, any creature pierced by a cungye's horn will have its life force siphoned away, invigorating the cungye with unholy ferocity. The horn can also unleash a terrible curse, reducing those subjected to it to nothing more than sickly husks.

***Beacon of Ruin.***
Cungye are despised by other horned celestials and despise them in turn. Some say this is because a cungye can be created through a dark ritual involving the horn of a unicorn or kirin. Others state that their diametric natures drive them to hate and seek to destroy each other. Whenever demonic forces from the lower planes assault the sanctuaries and forests of the mortal planes guarded by celestials, a cungye undoubtedly leads the charge. There is nothing a cungye yearns for more than to tear down the protective barriers of such havens and let destruction run rampant through once tranquil lands.

***Coveted Horns.***
Cungye command much respect and sway among demons and foul-hearted mortals alike. They are more intelligent and charismatic than the average demon despite their brutish appearance. Their ability to shatter the defenses of divine sanctuaries, which most lesser demons would never hope to assail, helps them gather influence. These factors mean that they either lead small bands of weaker demons and cultists or act as lieutenants to demon lords. The sight of a cungye with a celestial impaled upon its horn is enough to inspire any unholy army into a frenzy. However, their presence also stirs greed within their disciples, who seek to take the power of the cungye's horn for their own purposes.

There are many accounts of wizards, warlocks, and lesser demons managing to remove or steal the cungye's horn through twisted spells and trickery. This is a dangerous endeavor, as a cungye can function for some time without its horn and remains immensely dangerous, though over time, it withers away into nothing or sometimes into a shadow demon. The horns are often used as components in powerful rituals or fashioned into weapons with the life-draining properties of the cungye. Many black markets and auction houses with powerful occult items will have cungye horns among their collections.

>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 28 (4d10 + 6) piercing damage. If the cungye moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an extra 22 (4d10) piercing damage. If the target is Large or smaller, it is impaled on the cungye's horn, causing it to be grappled (escape DC 18). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of the cungye's turns. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the cungye gains temporary hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0. The cungye can't grapple other creatures with its Gore while it has a creature grappled this way.
>
> ***Tide of Languish (1/Day).*** The cungye chooses four creatures in a 30-foot cube within 120 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or fall prone and become cursed for the next 10 minutes. While cursed, the creature can't stand up and its Strength and Dexterity scores are reduced to 1. At the end of each of its turns, the affected creature can attempt another Charisma saving throw, ending the curse on a success.
>
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The cungye's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15). The cungye can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
>
> ***At will:*** *detect evil and good, protection from evil and good*
>
> ***1/day each:*** *dispel evil and good, dispel magic (5th level), locate creature*

### Hornless Cungye

 Through the casting of powerful spells or twisted surgery, a cungye's horn can be stolen. A cungye can live for 3 + 2d4 days without its horn before it dies and returns to the abyss as a demon with a Challenge Rating (CR) of 4 or less. While it is alive, it is a CR 7 creature, but it loses its gore attack, innate spellcasting, and its Tide of Languish ability. The <br> horn is a magical item worth 500 gp that can be forged <br> into a *sword of life stealing* by someone with proficiency <br> in smith's tools using at least 300 gp worth of smithing supplies.



### Cungye Tactics
If a cungye is unable to reach any creature or it sees <br> three or more creatures grouped together, it will use <br> its Tide of Languish ability. Otherwise, it immediately <br> gores the first target it can find, aiming for the one <br> with the lowest AC. As long as it has a target <br> grappled by its horn, it uses its claw attacks.

The valuable items looted from cungye will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cungye. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Cungye Loot Table
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
