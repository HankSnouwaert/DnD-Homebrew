## Dread Megalodon

The megalodon is the largest known predatory animal in existence and the tyrant king of the oceans. Anyone able to control one has a terrifying beast at their disposal, capable of dominating the seas. Still, for some, a "mere" megalodon is not enough.

Aquatic despots and mad artificers may opt to enhance their megalodon minions with extra weaponry and armor plating. This equipment is fused to the megalodon, and its physiology is permanently altered to allow it to control its new weapons as they are an extension of its body. Thus, a dread megalodon is born.

&emsp;***Devestating Arsonal.*** Dread megalodons are terrifying weapons capable of singlehandedly destroying small fleets and laying siege to coastal settlements. Their weaponry gives them long-range striking capabilities against enemies normally safe from a shark's attacks. Arcane cannons are among the most popular weapons attached to dread megalodons, and these magical devices can conjure and fire heavy cannon balls at the shark's will. Other weapon options include massive harpoon launchers, which can reel in prey, and energy beam devices capable of cooking lines of enemies at once.

***Diabolical Pets and Warbeasts.*** Dread megalodons are prized weapons of anyone who controls them. Seafaring or aquatic conquerers will utilize a dread megalodon like a flagship nautical weapon capable of tearing apart enemy fleets and bombarding coastal defenders. Mad geniuses with ambitions of world domination may see a dread megalodon as a prized pet to feed lackluster minions to. Such villains often enjoy subjecting captured heroes to elaborate (though often impractical) death traps involving their dread megalodon. 

### Alternate Weapons

If you wish to arm your dread megalodon with something other than a cannon, you can replace it with one of the following weapons which each provide an attack that replaces the dread megalodon’s cannon attack.

#### Eldritch Ray Gun

***Radiant Beam.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, range 1,000 ft., the megalodon chooses a straight line up to 100 feet long within range, and makes its attack roll against each creature of its choice in that line.  If the line is no longer than 10 feet long, it has advantage on these attack rolls. *Hit:* 7d6 (24)  radiant damage to the target.

#### Harpoon Launcher
***Harpoon.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +12 to hit, range 100/200 ft., one target. *Hit:* 55 (9d10 + 7) piercing damage. If the target must succeed on a Strength contest against the megalodon or be pulled up to 100 feet toward the megalodon.
