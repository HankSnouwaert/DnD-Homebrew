## Elephants
Elephants are colossal, intelligent beasts found in grasslands, savannas, and dense forests. Known for their long trunks and massive tusks, these creatures use their trunks with remarkable dexterity to grasp objects, gather food, and communicate. Their tusks serve both as tools for digging and stripping bark and as formidable weapons for defense and combat. Elephants are herbivores, consuming vast quantities of vegetation daily, including grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark.

Elephants thrive in regions with abundant water and vegetation, often found near rivers, lakes, and watering holes. They are social animals, typically forming close-knit herds led by a matriarch. These herds consist of related females and their young, while males often roam independently or form smaller bachelor groups. Elephants are known for their impressive memories and complex social structures, using a variety of vocalizations and body language to communicate within their herds.

These creatures are renowned for their sheer physical strength. They can easily uproot trees, push over large obstacles, and trample threats underfoot.

  Their thick skin provides significant protection against attacks, and their large ears help regulate body temperature in hot climates. Despite their size, elephants can move with surprising speed when necessary, capable of charging at high speeds to deter predators or intruders.

Some cultures train and use elephants as beasts of burden, taking advantage of their strength to carry heavy loads or perform laborious tasks. In times of war, elephants are sometimes employed as war beasts, outfitted with armor and used to break enemy lines or cause chaos on the battlefield. Hunters may seek their tusks for ivory, leading to potential conflicts with those who revere or protect these majestic creatures. Elephants are also revered in some societies, symbolizing strength, wisdom, and longevity, and are often featured in religious or cultural ceremonies.

These towering beasts inspire awe and respect, and wise adventurers approach them with caution, recognizing their immense power and intelligence. Whether encountered in the wild or in the service of humanoids, elephants remain one of the most formidable and respected creatures in the natural world.

***Dwarf Elephants.*** Dwarf elephants are a fascinating variation of their larger relatives, primarily found on isolated islands and in secluded forested regions. These creatures, though significantly smaller in size, retain many of the characteristics of their larger kin. Standing only about the height of a human, dwarf elephants have adapted to environments where resources are limited, allowing them to thrive in places where their larger counterparts could not. Their smaller stature makes them exceptionally agile, able to navigate dense underbrush and rocky terrain with ease. Despite their size, they possess the same intelligence and social complexity, often forming tight-knit family groups that exhibit strong bonds and cooperative behaviors.

Dwarf elephants are herbivores, feeding on a diet of leaves, fruits, and bark. They use their smaller yet equally dexterous trunks to forage and manipulate their environment. Their tusks, though shorter and more curved, are used for digging, foraging, and defense against predators. These creatures are also known for their remarkable memory and problem-solving abilities, traits that have helped them survive in challenging environments. Humanoids might encounter dwarf elephants while exploring remote regions or seeking rare resources unique to their habitats. Some cultures might domesticate them for labor, transportation, or ceremonial purposes, valuing their strength and gentle nature. However, as with their larger relatives, dwarf elephants are to be respected and approached with caution, as they are capable of defending themselves with surprising force if threatened.

***Forest Elephants.*** Forest elephants are smaller and more elusive than their savanna-dwelling relatives, primarily inhabiting dense tropical and subtropical forests. Adapted to life under the thick canopy, these elephants are adept at navigating narrow trails and thick underbrush, using their smaller size and incredible dexterity to move with surprising stealth. Their tusks are straighter and longer, aiding them in maneuvering through dense foliage and stripping bark from trees, which forms a significant part of their diet. Forest elephants are essential to their ecosystem, as their foraging habits help maintain the health and diversity of the forest by dispersing seeds and creating clearings that allow sunlight to reach the forest floor.

Socially, forest elephants tend to form smaller, more fluid groups compared to their savanna counterparts. These groups are often led by a matriarch and consist of closely related females and their young. Males usually lead more solitary lives, occasionally joining female groups during mating periods. Forest elephants communicate through a range of vocalizations, low-frequency rumbles, and physical gestures, allowing them to maintain contact over long distances even in the dense forest.

Humanoids might encounter forest elephants while exploring remote jungle regions. Some cultures living in proximity to these forests revere forest elephants, incorporating them into their mythology and traditions. However, conflicts can arise when human activities encroach on their habitats, leading to potential confrontations. Poaching for ivory remains a significant threat, although forest elephants are often more challenging to hunt due to their elusive nature and the difficult terrain they inhabit.

***Savannna Elephants.*** Savannah elephants, the largest and most iconic of their kind, are found wandering the expansive grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands of temperate and tropical regions. Towering over other creatures, these giants can reach over ten feet in height. Their distinctive, large ears serve multiple purposes: regulating body temperature and enabling long-distance communication through trumpeting calls and infrasonic rumbles. The elephants' long, curved tusks are indispensable tools for foraging and formidable weapons in conflicts.

Living in structured social groups, savannah elephants are typically led by a matriarch, the oldest and most experienced female. These herds consist of related females and their offspring, while adult males usually live solitary lives or join bachelor groups. Known for their incredible memory and navigation skills, these elephants travel vast distances to find food and water, often following ancient migratory routes. This movement is crucial for their ecosystem, as they disperse seeds and create water holes that benefit other wildlife.

Humanoids may seek to tame these colossal beasts as mounts or labor animals, capitalizing on their immense strength for warfare or heavy lifting. The elephants' tusks, believed to possess magical properties, become coveted items for enchantment and trade, drawing the interest of adventurers and merchants.

***Mammoths.***
Mammoths are towering behemoths of the tundras and icy plains, easily recognized by their long, curved tusks and thick, shaggy fur. Their immense strength allows them to shovel snow, uproot trees, and fend off predators. Broad, padded feet enable them to move effortlessly across snowy landscapes. Their tusks are also used for foraging buried vegetation and breaking ice to access water sources.

Social creatures, mammoths form herds led by a dominant matriarch. These herds consist of females and their young, while adult males often roam alone or form smaller bachelor groups. They migrate in search of food, consuming vast amounts of grasses, shrubs, and other hardy vegetation to sustain their massive bulk. These migrations shape their environment, aiding in seed dispersal and creating natural clearings that benefit other wildlife.

Tribes of the frozen north revere mammoths as symbols of strength and endurance, using their bones, tusks, and hides for tools, weapons, and clothing. Mammoth ivory is prized for crafting enchanted items and ceremonial artifacts. Legends often speak of the wisdom and memory of these majestic beasts, and they are sometimes seen as guardians of ancient secrets.

Conflicts arise when mammoths raid settlements for food during harsh winters or when their migratory routes are disrupted by humanoid activities. Some daring individuals attempt to tame mammoths as mounts or beasts of burden, leveraging their power for transportation, heavy labor, and combat. However, taming a mammoth requires great skill and respect, as they are known for their intelligence and strong familial bonds.

***Palaeoloxodons.*** Palaeoloxodons, or dire elephants, are even larger and more imposing than mammoths, often exceeding fourteen feet at the shoulder. They are characterized by exceptionally long, straight tusks and thick, leathery skin that offers protection against predators and harsh conditions.

Found in temperate and subtropical regions, palaeoloxodons thrived in both forests and plains, consuming vast amounts of vegetation. Their powerful trunks were used for foraging and communication through vocalizations and gestures. They formed large herds led by a matriarch, displaying strong familial bonds and cooperative behavior.

Many cultures revere palaeoloxodons as symbols of ancient power and wisdom. Their tusks are highly sought after for creating powerful artifacts and weapons believed to hold magical properties. Legends often depict them as guardians of sacred sites or ancient secrets, with their long lifespans granting them knowledge of bygone eras.

Encounters with palaeoloxodons are awe-inspiring and potentially perilous. While generally peaceful, they become formidable opponents if provoked. Some tribes coexist with these giants, respecting their migratory paths, but conflicts can arise when these paths intersect with human settlements or resource-rich areas. Palaeoloxodons embody the untamed and enduring spirit of the natural world.

### Elephant Tactics
#### Wild Elephant Behavior

**Initial Response:** Picks up and throws nearby objects at threats to try to scare them off before engaging.<br>
**Charge Attack:** Charges and gores the enemy, then throws them with its trunk to facilitate another charge.

#### Trained Elephant Behavior
Similar to wild elephant, but uses throws to isolate targets from their allies.

### Elephant Loot
The valuable items looted from elephants will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest the hide of an elephant. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Elephant Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

## Grootslang
Deep beneath the earth lies <br> an ancient horror known as the <br> grootslang. This terrifying hybrid <br> measures 50 feet long, with the body <br> of a powerful, sinuous snake ending in <br> an elephant head with serpentine eyes <br> that shine like gemstones and multiple <br> pairs of twisted tusks coated with toxic <br> mucus. Any creature pierced by these tusks <br> is inflicted with a venom that impedes their ability <br> to cast complex spells. Even those wise enough to keep <br> their distance may be dismayed to learn that the grootslang can spray its poison with its twisted, snakelike trunk. Few creatures are strong enough to contest the grootslangâ€™s physical might, as even a stone giant caught within its coils will be crushed.

Within this distorted creature is an even more hideous mind. The grootslang's intellect rivals the most scholarly of wizards or the most cunning of devils. Its instincts surpass even those of the most seasoned rangers or wild beasts. It will not easily fall for traps or be goaded and quickly adapts its assault to leverage any weaknesses it gleans in its foes. As a final testament to its alien nature, the grootslang emits a sound that is a mix between an elephantâ€™s trumpeting and a snakeâ€™s hissing. Any creature that hears this sound will find their mind clouded and filled with bewildering thoughts, making them easy prey.

***Ancient Mistake.*** Accounts of this abomination are rare to near nonexistent, as almost none who have encountered this archaic amalgamation survived to tell the tale. Those who have often attempt to forget they ever saw such a loathsome creature. Some texts say that this perplexing beast was fashioned by the gods when they first began to create life in the world. Novice in the art of creating wild beasts, they created the grootslang with far too much power and intellect. Realizing their error, they began to dismember their creation, fashioning it into the first snakes and elephants that walked the world. 


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Others say the grootslang are even older, created by eldritch gods as terrible minions. When these eldritch gods were eventually overthrown to make way for mortal life by todayâ€™s pantheons, the grootslang were destroyed.

However, some of these grootslang managed to survive their original culling at the hands of the gods, slithering into the deep crevices of the world. Those that survived have hidden themselves from the eyes of divinity and their mortal worshipers.


***Hoarder of Diamonds.*** Grootslang lairs are usually located in caverns far beneath the ground in remote wastelands. These entrances are inconspicuous. Hidden in the depths of a grootslangâ€™s lair are hordes of diamonds which it has dug out from the earth. Many adventurers have heard of these vast caverns of wealth and have embarked on foolhardy expeditions to acquire the treasure, only to be grossly unprepared to face what lies within. The items of value they carry often end up added to the grootslangâ€™s hoard, though none are worth more to the creature than diamonds.

***Primordial Grootslang.*** Some speak of the primordial grootslang, a more powerful variant of the species. The few sources that mention this deviant claim that these are the grootslang that survived the original extermination of their kind. The weaker versions were supposedly spawned or created afterward with some sort of strange magic by the primordial grootslang. Some even claim there is only one primordial grootslang, and that it has its own mortal warlocks who serve it, gathering wealth. What these warlocks exchange with their elephantine master remains unknown.

>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The grootslang can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Grootslang Venom.*** Whenever a creature takes poison damage from the grootslang, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned this way, the target can't cast spells that are 3rd level or higher. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save, and ending the effect on a successful one. If the creature fails this repeated saving throw by 5 or more, it becomes paralyzed until the poison ends.
>
> ***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The grootslang has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The grootslang has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Telepathic Shroud.*** The grootslang is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as to all divination spells.
>
> ***Trumpeting Hiss.*** At the start of the grootslang's turn, each creature of the grootslang's choice within 120 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or be befuddled for 1 minute. Creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or lower are unaffected. While befuddled, a creature rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect ends on a successful Intelligence saving throw at the end of its turn. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to the grootslang's Trumpeting Hiss for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Trunk.*** The grootslang can grasp objects with its trunk and use it as a snorkel. The trunk has a reach of 30 ft. and can lift up to 2000 pounds. It can perform simple tasks such as lifting, dropping, holding, pushing, or pulling an object or a creature; opening or closing a door or container. It cannot wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision.
>
> ***Tunneler.*** The grootslang can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.
> 
> ### Actions (NOTE: What is Coil?)
> ***Multiattack.*** The grootslang makes two attacks: one with its Poisonous Gore or Coil and one with its Coiling Trunk, Poison Spray, or Throw.
>
> ***Poisonous Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) poison damage. If the grootslang moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, the grootslang can make one Coil attack against it as a bonus action.
>
> ***Coiling Trunk.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (1d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. If the grootslang's trunk is not holding anything and the target is a Huge or smaller creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 22). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained and the grootslang can't grapple another creature with its Coiling Trunk.
>
> ***Poison Spray.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) poison damage. The grootslang can make this attack while it has a creature grappled with its trunk.
>
> ***Fling.*** The grootslang chooses one object or creature it is holding or grappling and throws it up to 60 feet away. If the target hits a solid surface, it takes 19 (2d10 + 8) damage and lands prone. If the thrown target would hit another creature, the creature that would be hit must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is hit, takes 19 (2d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone if it is Huge or smaller. On a successful save, it dodges out of the way, takes no damage, and is not knocked prone.
>
> ***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 34 (4d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 22). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained, and the grootslang can't constrict another target or burrow.
>
> ***Crush.*** Each creature the grootslang has grappled must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw, taking 52 (8d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more or automatically fails, the damage is doubled. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it dies.

### Grootslang lair

Grootslangs make their lairs in diamond-filled caves located in remote deserts and wastelands, seeking to avoid unwanted attention from neighboring civilizations. Their craving for wealth permeates the surrounding landscape, inducing greed in those with weak wills, leading them deeper into the heart of the grootslang's territory, only to fall victim to the monstrosity. Few creatures inhabit the surrounding landscape; those that do are either the hardiest of beasts that avoid grootslangs or desert and cavern-dwelling humanoids and weaker aberrations that worship the grootslang. These worshippers may even conduct raids on its behalf, hoping to find items valuable enough to serve as tribute.

The cavern is a network of tunnels that the grootslang has either created or modified, forming a maze of winding passageways. At the heart of this labyrinth lies the grootslang's hoard, with diamonds and other gems lining every wall, along with various magic items from those who have perished in confrontation with the grootslang.

 While in its lair, the grootslang's challenge rating increases by 5.

#### Lair Actions
When the grootslang rolls initiative, its lair awakens to aid it. Until combat ends or the grootslang dies, the lair possesses an Intelligence of 19 and acts autonomously but always in the grootslang's best interest. The lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can use one of the following effects; it cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The lair creates a tiny magical diamond that springs into existence at an unoccupied location of the lair's choice within range. The diamond lasts until the Grootslang dies or the diamond is outside the lair for 1 hour. The diamond has 30 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, an AC of 20, and resistance to all damage except thunder and bludgeoning. It is immune to psychic and poison damage. Reducing a diamond to 0 hit points destroys it. Only three diamonds can be created at a time; if the lair creates a diamond while three are already in existence, one previous diamond of the lair's choice is destroyed.

- The lair chooses one creature within 15 feet of a diamond it has created, and that creature must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or shrink to a height of 1 inch and be imprisoned inside the diamond. The target is incapacitated and can see out of the diamond and other creatures can see into it, but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The creature is freed and returned to its normal size in the nearest unoccupied space when the diamond is destroyed. Each diamond can only have one creature trapped within it.

 - The lair chooses one creature within 60 feet of a diamond it has created, and that creature must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become infatuated with the diamond for the next minute or until it is destroyed or the creature is trapped inside the diamond. At the end of each of the target's turns, if it is not holding the diamond, it takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage.

#### Regional Effects

The region containing the grootslang's lair is warped by its magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

 - The grootslang is aware of any creature that sleeps within 6 miles of its lair. It may cause the creature to dream of vast hordes of diamonds and other troves of wealth. The creature then senses the direction to the lair's location until it is within 1 mile of the lair. If the creature is ever more than 6 miles away from the lair, it loses this sense.

 - Divination magic that attempts to locate the grootslang's lair or any diamonds within 1 mile of the lair automatically fails. Examples would be *find the path* or *locate object*.

- The grootslang is aware of the location of any diamonds within 1 mile of its lair and can sense and telepathically communicate with any creature that is touching them.

 If the grootslang dies, these effects immediately fade.

> ## Primordial Grootslang
> If you want your grootslang to be suitable for solo encounters against the players by itself, you can increase its hit points to 346 (21d20+126) and give it the legendary actions described below. Doing so increases its CR to 20.
> ___
> ### Legendary Actions
> The grootslang can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The grootslang regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
>
> ***Check.*** The grootslang makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
>
> ***Move.*** The grootslang moves up to 25 feet without provoking attacks of opportunity.
>
> ***Tail Attack.*** The grootslang makes an attack with the following properties: *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 17 (3d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and the target is pushed or pulled 15 feet toward or away from the grootslang.
>
> ***Poison Spray.*** The grootslang makes a Poison Spray attack.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If the grootslang is suffering from an effect that allows it to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of its next turn, it may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. It can use this legendary action while incapacitated.
>
> ***Bewildering Winding. (Costs 2 Actions)***  The grootslang moves in a confusing rhythm. Each creature within 300 of the grootslang that can see it must make a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or lose concentration and, on its next turn, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

### Grootslang Tactics
Grootslang's have high Wisdom and Intelligence, which allows them to evaluate the strengths and weakness of their foes and choose their tactics appropriately. <br>

**Targeting Spellcasters:** Prioritizes spellcasters due to their typically lower physical stats and vulnerability to venom.<br>

**Ambush Tactics:** Utilizes burrowing speed to bypass frontline characters and target backline ones.

**Grappling:** Employs trunk to grapple targets, using crushing feature when two creatures are grappled.

**Retreat:** Flees if below a third of hit points or outmatched, unless its diamond hoard is threatened.

\columnbreak

#### Ancient Grootslang Tactics
The primary tactics difference with ancient grootslangs is their use of legendary actions:

**Tail Attack:** Used to push away close melee attackers or position targets for a gore attack.

**Poison Spray:** Primary action, aimed at poisoning as many targets as possible, especially those with weak Constitution.

**Bewildering Winding:** Disrupts enemy formations and counters high-level spellcasting.





### Grootslang Loot
The valuable items looted from grootslang will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a grootslang. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
