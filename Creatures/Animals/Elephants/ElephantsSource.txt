## Elephants
Elephants are colossal, intelligent beasts found in grasslands, savannas, and dense forests. Known for their long trunks and massive tusks, these creatures use their trunks with remarkable dexterity to grasp objects, gather food, and communicate. Their tusks serve both as tools for digging and stripping bark and as formidable weapons for defense and combat. Elephants are herbivores, consuming vast quantities of vegetation daily, including grasses, leaves, fruits, and bark.

Elephants thrive in regions with abundant water and vegetation, often found near rivers, lakes, and watering holes. They are social animals, typically forming close-knit herds led by a matriarch. These herds consist of related females and their young, while males often roam independently or form smaller bachelor groups. Elephants are known for their impressive memories and complex social structures, using a variety of vocalizations and body language to communicate within their herds.

These creatures are renowned for their sheer physical strength. They can easily uproot trees, push over large obstacles, and trample threats underfoot.

  Their thick skin provides significant protection against attacks, and their large ears help regulate body temperature in hot climates. Despite their size, elephants can move with surprising speed when necessary, capable of charging at high speeds to deter predators or intruders.

Some cultures train and use elephants as beasts of burden, taking advantage of their strength to carry heavy loads or perform laborious tasks. In times of war, elephants are sometimes employed as war beasts, outfitted with armor and used to break enemy lines or cause chaos on the battlefield. Hunters may seek their tusks for ivory, leading to potential conflicts with those who revere or protect these majestic creatures. Elephants are also revered in some societies, symbolizing strength, wisdom, and longevity, and are often featured in religious or cultural ceremonies.

These towering beasts inspire awe and respect, and wise adventurers approach them with caution, recognizing their immense power and intelligence. Whether encountered in the wild or in the service of humanoids, elephants remain one of the most formidable and respected creatures in the natural world.

***Dwarf Elephants.*** Dwarf elephants are a fascinating variation of their larger relatives, primarily found on isolated islands and in secluded forested regions. These creatures, though significantly smaller in size, retain many of the characteristics of their larger kin. Standing only about the height of a human, dwarf elephants have adapted to environments where resources are limited, allowing them to thrive in places where their larger counterparts could not. Their smaller stature makes them exceptionally agile, able to navigate dense underbrush and rocky terrain with ease. Despite their size, they possess the same intelligence and social complexity, often forming tight-knit family groups that exhibit strong bonds and cooperative behaviors.

Dwarf elephants are herbivores, feeding on a diet of leaves, fruits, and bark. They use their smaller yet equally dexterous trunks to forage and manipulate their environment. Their tusks, though shorter and more curved, are used for digging, foraging, and defense against predators. These creatures are also known for their remarkable memory and problem-solving abilities, traits that have helped them survive in challenging environments. Humanoids might encounter dwarf elephants while exploring remote regions or seeking rare resources unique to their habitats. Some cultures might domesticate them for labor, transportation, or ceremonial purposes, valuing their strength and gentle nature. However, as with their larger relatives, dwarf elephants are to be respected and approached with caution, as they are capable of defending themselves with surprising force if threatened.

***Forest Elephants.*** Forest elephants are smaller and more elusive than their savanna-dwelling relatives, primarily inhabiting dense tropical and subtropical forests. Adapted to life under the thick canopy, these elephants are adept at navigating narrow trails and thick underbrush, using their smaller size and incredible dexterity to move with surprising stealth. Their tusks are straighter and longer, aiding them in maneuvering through dense foliage and stripping bark from trees, which forms a significant part of their diet. Forest elephants are essential to their ecosystem, as their foraging habits help maintain the health and diversity of the forest by dispersing seeds and creating clearings that allow sunlight to reach the forest floor.

Socially, forest elephants tend to form smaller, more fluid groups compared to their savanna counterparts. These groups are often led by a matriarch and consist of closely related females and their young. Males usually lead more solitary lives, occasionally joining female groups during mating periods. Forest elephants communicate through a range of vocalizations, low-frequency rumbles, and physical gestures, allowing them to maintain contact over long distances even in the dense forest.

Humanoids might encounter forest elephants while exploring remote jungle regions. Some cultures living in proximity to these forests revere forest elephants, incorporating them into their mythology and traditions. However, conflicts can arise when human activities encroach on their habitats, leading to potential confrontations. Poaching for ivory remains a significant threat, although forest elephants are often more challenging to hunt due to their elusive nature and the difficult terrain they inhabit.

***Savannna Elephants.*** Savannah elephants, the largest and most iconic of their kind, are found wandering the expansive grasslands, savannas, and open woodlands of temperate and tropical regions. Towering over other creatures, these giants can reach over ten feet in height. Their distinctive, large ears serve multiple purposes: regulating body temperature and enabling long-distance communication through trumpeting calls and infrasonic rumbles. The elephants' long, curved tusks are indispensable tools for foraging and formidable weapons in conflicts.

Living in structured social groups, savannah elephants are typically led by a matriarch, the oldest and most experienced female. These herds consist of related females and their offspring, while adult males usually live solitary lives or join bachelor groups. Known for their incredible memory and navigation skills, these elephants travel vast distances to find food and water, often following ancient migratory routes. This movement is crucial for their ecosystem, as they disperse seeds and create water holes that benefit other wildlife.

Humanoids may seek to tame these colossal beasts as mounts or labor animals, capitalizing on their immense strength for warfare or heavy lifting. The elephants' tusks, believed to possess magical properties, become coveted items for enchantment and trade, drawing the interest of adventurers and merchants.

***Mammoths.***
Mammoths are towering behemoths of the tundras and icy plains, easily recognized by their long, curved tusks and thick, shaggy fur. Their immense strength allows them to shovel snow, uproot trees, and fend off predators. Broad, padded feet enable them to move effortlessly across snowy landscapes. Their tusks are also used for foraging buried vegetation and breaking ice to access water sources.

Social creatures, mammoths form herds led by a dominant matriarch. These herds consist of females and their young, while adult males often roam alone or form smaller bachelor groups. They migrate in search of food, consuming vast amounts of grasses, shrubs, and other hardy vegetation to sustain their massive bulk. These migrations shape their environment, aiding in seed dispersal and creating natural clearings that benefit other wildlife.

Tribes of the frozen north revere mammoths as symbols of strength and endurance, using their bones, tusks, and hides for tools, weapons, and clothing. Mammoth ivory is prized for crafting enchanted items and ceremonial artifacts. Legends often speak of the wisdom and memory of these majestic beasts, and they are sometimes seen as guardians of ancient secrets.

Conflicts arise when mammoths raid settlements for food during harsh winters or when their migratory routes are disrupted by humanoid activities. Some daring individuals attempt to tame mammoths as mounts or beasts of burden, leveraging their power for transportation, heavy labor, and combat. However, taming a mammoth requires great skill and respect, as they are known for their intelligence and strong familial bonds.

***Palaeoloxodons.*** Palaeoloxodons, or dire elephants, are even larger and more imposing than mammoths, often exceeding fourteen feet at the shoulder. They are characterized by exceptionally long, straight tusks and thick, leathery skin that offers protection against predators and harsh conditions.

Found in temperate and subtropical regions, palaeoloxodons thrived in both forests and plains, consuming vast amounts of vegetation. Their powerful trunks were used for foraging and communication through vocalizations and gestures. They formed large herds led by a matriarch, displaying strong familial bonds and cooperative behavior.

Many cultures revere palaeoloxodons as symbols of ancient power and wisdom. Their tusks are highly sought after for creating powerful artifacts and weapons believed to hold magical properties. Legends often depict them as guardians of sacred sites or ancient secrets, with their long lifespans granting them knowledge of bygone eras.

Encounters with palaeoloxodons are awe-inspiring and potentially perilous. While generally peaceful, they become formidable opponents if provoked. Some tribes coexist with these giants, respecting their migratory paths, but conflicts can arise when these paths intersect with human settlements or resource-rich areas. Palaeoloxodons embody the untamed and enduring spirit of the natural world.

### Elephant Tactics
#### Wild Elephant Behavior

**Initial Response:** Picks up and throws nearby objects at threats to try to scare them off before engaging.<br>
**Charge Attack:** Charges and gores the enemy, then throws them with its trunk to facilitate another charge.

#### Trained Elephant Behavior
Similar to wild elephant, but uses throws to isolate targets from their allies.

### Elephant Loot
The valuable items looted from elephants will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworkerâ€™s Tools) check to harvest the hide of an elephant. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Elephant Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
