## Grootslang
Deep beneath the earth lies <br> an ancient horror known as the <br> grootslang. This terrifying hybrid <br> measures 50 feet long, with the body <br> of a powerful, sinuous snake ending in <br> an elephant head with serpentine eyes <br> that shine like gemstones and multiple <br> pairs of twisted tusks coated with toxic <br> mucus. Any creature pierced by these tusks <br> is inflicted with a venom that impedes their ability <br> to cast complex spells. Even those wise enough to keep <br> their distance may be dismayed to learn that the grootslang can spray its poison with its twisted, snakelike trunk. Few creatures are strong enough to contest the grootslang’s physical might, as even a stone giant caught within its coils will be crushed.

Within this distorted creature is an even more hideous mind. The grootslang's intellect rivals the most scholarly of wizards or the most cunning of devils. Its instincts surpass even those of the most seasoned rangers or wild beasts. It will not easily fall for traps or be goaded and quickly adapts its assault to leverage any weaknesses it gleans in its foes. As a final testament to its alien nature, the grootslang emits a sound that is a mix between an elephant’s trumpeting and a snake’s hissing. Any creature that hears this sound will find their mind clouded and filled with bewildering thoughts, making them easy prey.

***Ancient Mistake.*** Accounts of this abomination are rare to near nonexistent, as almost none who have encountered this archaic amalgamation survived to tell the tale. Those who have often attempt to forget they ever saw such a loathsome creature. Some texts say that this perplexing beast was fashioned by the gods when they first began to create life in the world. Novice in the art of creating wild beasts, they created the grootslang with far too much power and intellect. Realizing their error, they began to dismember their creation, fashioning it into the first snakes and elephants that walked the world.

Others say the grootslang are even older, created by eldritch gods as terrible minions. When these eldritch gods were eventually overthrown to make way for mortal life by today’s pantheons, the grootslang were destroyed.

However, some of these grootslang managed to survive their original culling at the hands of the gods, slithering into the deep crevices of the world. Those that survived have hidden themselves from the eyes of divinity and their mortal worshipers.


***Hoarder of Diamonds.*** Grootslang lairs are usually located in caverns far beneath the ground in remote wastelands. These entrances are inconspicuous. Hidden in the depths of a grootslang’s lair are hordes of diamonds which it has dug out from the earth. Many adventurers have heard of these vast caverns of wealth and have embarked on foolhardy expeditions to acquire the treasure, only to be grossly unprepared to face what lies within. The items of value they carry often end up added to the grootslang’s hoard, though none are worth more to the creature than diamonds.

***Primordial Grootslang.*** Some speak of the primordial grootslang, a more powerful variant of the species. The few sources that mention this deviant claim that these are the grootslang that survived the original extermination of their kind. The weaker versions were supposedly spawned or created afterward with some sort of strange magic by the primordial grootslang. Some even claim there is only one primordial grootslang, and that it has its own mortal warlocks who serve it, gathering wealth. What these warlocks exchange with their elephantine master remains unknown.

> ___
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.*** The grootslang can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Grootslang Venom.*** Whenever a creature takes poison damage from the grootslang, it must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. While poisoned this way, the target can't cast spells that are 3rd level or higher. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw, taking 13 (3d8) poison damage on a failed save, and ending the effect on a successful one. If the creature fails this repeated saving throw by 5 or more, it becomes paralyzed until the poison ends.
>
> ***Keen Hearing and Smell.*** The grootslang has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The grootslang has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Telepathic Shroud.*** The grootslang is immune to any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, as well as to all divination spells.
>
> ***Trumpeting Hiss.*** At the start of the grootslang's turn, each creature of the grootslang's choice within 120 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw or be befuddled for 1 minute. Creatures with an Intelligence of 2 or lower are unaffected. While befuddled, a creature rolls a d6 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect ends on a successful Intelligence saving throw at the end of its turn. Once a creature succeeds on the saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to the grootslang's Trumpeting Hiss for the next 24 hours.
>
> ***Trunk.*** The grootslang can grasp objects with its trunk and use it as a snorkel. The trunk has a reach of 30 ft. and can lift up to 2000 pounds. It can perform simple tasks such as lifting, dropping, holding, pushing, or pulling an object or a creature; opening or closing a door or container. It cannot wield weapons or shields or do anything that requires manual precision.
>
> ***Tunneler.*** The grootslang can burrow through solid rock at half its burrow speed and leaves a 10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The grootslang makes two attacks: one with its Poisonous Gore or Constrict and one with its Coiling Trunk, Poison Spray, or Throw.
>
> ***Poisonous Gore.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 8) piercing damage plus 27 (6d8) poison damage. If the grootslang moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is knocked prone, the grootslang can make one Constrict attack against it as a bonus action.
>
> ***Coiling Trunk.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 30 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (1d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage. If the grootslang's trunk is not holding anything and the target is a Huge or smaller creature, the target is grappled (escape DC 22). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained and the grootslang can't grapple another creature with its Coiling Trunk.
>
> ***Poison Spray.*** *Ranged Spell Attack:* +14 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (3d8) poison damage. The grootslang can make this attack while it has a creature grappled with its trunk.
>
> ***Fling.*** The grootslang chooses one object or creature it is holding or grappling and throws it up to 60 feet away. If the target hits a solid surface, it takes 19 (2d10 + 8) damage and lands prone. If the thrown target would hit another creature, the creature that would be hit must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is hit, takes 19 (2d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone if it is Huge or smaller. On a successful save, it dodges out of the way, takes no damage, and is not knocked prone.
>
> ***Constrict.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. *Hit:* 34 (4d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage. The target is grappled (escape DC 22). Until this grapple ends, the creature is restrained, and the grootslang can't constrict another target or burrow.
>
> ***Crush.*** Each creature the grootslang has grappled must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw, taking 52 (8d10 + 8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If the target fails the saving throw by 10 or more or automatically fails, the damage is doubled. If this damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it dies.

### Grootslang lair

Grootslangs make their lairs in diamond-filled caves located in remote deserts and wastelands, seeking to avoid unwanted attention from neighboring civilizations. Their craving for wealth permeates the surrounding landscape, inducing greed in those with weak wills, leading them deeper into the heart of the grootslang's territory, only to fall victim to the monstrosity. Few creatures inhabit the surrounding landscape; those that do are either the hardiest of beasts that avoid grootslangs or desert and cavern-dwelling humanoids and weaker aberrations that worship the grootslang. These worshippers may even conduct raids on its behalf, hoping to find items valuable enough to serve as tribute.

The cavern is a network of tunnels that the grootslang has either created or modified, forming a maze of winding passageways. At the heart of this labyrinth lies the grootslang's hoard, with diamonds and other gems lining every wall, along with various magic items from those who have perished in confrontation with the grootslang.

 While in its lair, the grootslang's challenge rating increases by 5.

#### Lair Actions
When the grootslang rolls initiative, its lair awakens to aid it. Until combat ends or the grootslang dies, the lair possesses an Intelligence of 19 and acts autonomously but always in the grootslang's best interest. The lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can use one of the following effects; it cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:

- The lair creates a tiny magical diamond that springs into existence at an unoccupied location of the lair's choice within range. The diamond lasts until the Grootslang dies or the diamond is outside the lair for 1 hour. The diamond has 30 hit points, a damage threshold of 10, an AC of 20, and resistance to all damage except thunder and bludgeoning. It is immune to psychic and poison damage. Reducing a diamond to 0 hit points destroys it. Only three diamonds can be created at a time; if the lair creates a diamond while three are already in existence, one previous diamond of the lair's choice is destroyed.

- The lair chooses one creature within 15 feet of a diamond it has created, and that creature must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw or shrink to a height of 1 inch and be imprisoned inside the diamond. The target is incapacitated and can see out of the diamond and other creatures can see into it, but nothing else can pass through, even by means of teleportation or planar travel. The creature is freed and returned to its normal size in the nearest unoccupied space when the diamond is destroyed. Each diamond can only have one creature trapped within it.

 - The lair chooses one creature within 60 feet of a diamond it has created, and that creature must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become infatuated with the diamond for the next minute or until it is destroyed. At the end of each of the target's turns, if it is not holding the diamond, it takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage.

#### Regional Effects

The region containing the grootslang's lair is warped by its magic, creating one or more of the following effects:

 - The grootslang is aware of any creature that sleeps within 6 miles of its lair. It may cause the creature to dream of vast hordes of diamonds and other troves of wealth. The creature then senses the direction to the lair's location until it is within 1 mile of the lair. If the creature is ever more than 6 miles away from the lair, it loses this sense.

 - Divination magic that attempts to locate the grootslang's lair or any diamonds within 1 mile of the lair automatically fails. Examples would be *find the path* or *locate object*.

- The grootslang is aware of the location of any diamonds within 1 mile of its lair and can sense and telepathically communicate with any creature that is touching them.

 If the grootslang dies, these effects immediately fade.




### Grootslang Tactics
Grootslang's have high Wisdom and Intelligence, which allows them to evaluate the strengths and weakness of their foes and choose their tactics appropriately. <br>

**Targeting Spellcasters:** Prioritizes spellcasters due to their typically lower physical stats and vulnerability to venom.<br>

**Ambush Tactics:** Utilizes burrowing speed to bypass frontline characters and target backline ones.

**Grappling:** Employs trunk to grapple targets, using crushing feature when two creatures are grappled.

**Retreat:** Flees if below a third of hit points or outmatched, unless its diamond hoard is threatened.

### Grootslang Loot
The valuable items looted from grootslang will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a grootslang. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Grootslang Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Grootslang Loot Table
