## Cheetahs
Cheetahs are sleek, agile predators that thrive in open grasslands, savannas, and lightly wooded areas. Renowned for their incredible speed, they are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching up to 70 miles per hour in short bursts. Their slender bodies, long legs, and flexible spines enable these remarkable feats, allowing them to swiftly overtake prey such as antelope and hares. Their claws, which are semi-retractable, provide additional grip during their high-speed chases, while their keen eyesight allows them to spot potential prey from a distance.

Cheetahs are typically solitary or found in small family groups. They rely on stealth and camouflage to approach their prey closely before initiating a chase. Once within range, they accelerate rapidly, closing the distance in seconds. The hunt usually concludes with a suffocating bite to the throat of the prey, a method that is both quick and efficient. Despite their hunting prowess, cheetahs are relatively lightweight compared to other large predators, making them vulnerable to larger carnivores and scavengers.

Some cultures have mastered the art of training these magnificent creatures for hunting, using their unparalleled speed and agility to pursue game. The sight of a trained cheetah in action is both thrilling and awe-inspiring. Wealthy individuals and nobility might keep cheetahs as exotic companions, showcasing their elegance and power. Additionally, cheetah pelts are highly valued for their distinctive spotted patterns, often crafted into garments or accessories believed to bestow grace and swiftness upon the wearer.

While not typically a threat to humanoids unless provoked or threatened, a cheetah's ability to strike with lightning speed makes it a formidable adversary if confronted. Some hunters seek out cheetahs for their prized pelts, though this often leads to conflicts with those who revere the animals as symbols of agility and hunting prowess. Whether admired for their beauty or respected for their hunting skills, cheetahs occupy a unique and revered place in the natural world, embodying both elegance and lethal efficiency.

***Giant Cheetahs.*** Giant cheetahs, much larger than their common relatives, roam grasslands and open plains as apex predators. Standing nearly twice as tall as regular cheetahs, they have sleek, muscular builds that enable remarkable speeds. Their powerful legs and semi-retractable claws provide traction, allowing them to hunt larger prey like deer and wild cattle with agility. Using stealth and speed, they quickly close in on their targets, ensuring a swift kill with sharp claws and powerful jaws. Despite their size, they retain keen eyesight and acute senses, detecting threats and opportunities from afar.

Humanoids are drawn to giant cheetahs for their hunting prowess and imposing presence. Some cultures revere them as symbols of strength, incorporating them into myths and traditions. Skilled tamers and hunters capture and train these cheetahs for grand hunts or as war beasts. Their distinctive, spotted pelts are highly prized for garments symbolizing power. Encounters with giant cheetahs are rare and dangerous, as their size and strength make them formidable. While they avoid humanoids unless provoked, confrontations require caution and respect. The allure of capturing or slaying one for its valuable pelt or prestige drives adventurers to seek them out, leading to perilous pursuits across wild landscapes.

### Cheetah Tactics
Cheetahs generally target extremely fragile prey, such as gazelles, unless they are hunting with other cheetahs. However, when working with a group of humanoid hunters, the primary role of the cheetah is to prevent the prey from escaping, allowing the other members of the hunting party to catch it.

##### Cheetah Adventure Hooks

### Cheetah Loot
The valuable items looted from cheetahs will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide of a cheetah. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Cheetah Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Zephyr Fangs
The zephyr fang is a strange elemental beast resembling a cheetah, with sky-blue fur and white stripes running along its body. A ridge of silky, pearl-like hair extends from its back to its head, forming white fur plumes.

Zephyr fangs stalk the sky palaces and floating islands of the djinni, where they are favored pets of the air genies. It is said that the original zephyr fangs were cheetahs admired by the djinni for their speed and grace. Over generations, as these cheetahs lived in the Elemental Plane of Air, they became infused with its power. Now, it is common for djinni to have a coalition of zephyr fangs in their menageries. These creatures are splendid trophies for their djinni owners and are often taken along when the djinni seek to capture new slaves, much like nobles using cheetahs for hunting.

Zephyr fangs make their mundane kin appear lethargic by comparison. They can cross a mile within a minute, moving so fast that they become a blur to the eye, making it nearly impossible for foes to land an attack. They are also far more cunning than regular cheetahs, able to trip up prey skilled at disengaging from combat. Though primarily used to hunt on the Material Plane, zephyr fangs are well-adapted to their native environment of the Plane of Air. While they cannot fly, they can run across clouds as if they were solid ground and fall like feathers, preventing lethal drops.

Though zephyr fangs are mostly found in the service of djinni, there are many cases where their masters have been captured or killed, leaving the zephyr fangs on their own. These independent zephyr fangs often escape to the Material Plane, where most normal beasts stand little chance once a zephyr fang has honed in on them.
