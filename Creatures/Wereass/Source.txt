# Wereass
Of all the lycanthropes to roam the world, none are so obnoxious as the wereass.  These braying jackasses refuse to take their world seriously, and they behave as though they are living in an inconsequential game.  While they are not as malicious or predatory as other lycanthropes, a wereass's penchant for chaos and tomfoolery often leads to it being despised by all who cross its path.  

Humanoids afflicted with this form of lycanthropy assume the aspects of a donkey.  In their fully humanoid form, their ears, nose, and mouth are slightly exaggerated, and their braying laughter grates the ears of everyone in their presence.  In their hybrid and donkey form, their hooves grant them a powerful kick, and they are fond of trampling others while they're down. 

Wereass's treat the world around them as though it's all a game with no consequences.  They are always searching for their next source of pleasure and amusement.  Theft, sabotage, and inciting chaos are some of a wereass's favorite hobbies.  A wereass will sometimes aid adventures in their quests if they seem interesting enough, though they make for unreliable allies at best.  Even if a wereass doesn't outright betray its party, it will still attempt to goad those around it into making chaotic and shortsighted choices.  Such suggestions from a wereass might include: 

"Why bargain with a merchant when you can steal?"  "Do we really need to return these items we were sent to retrieve?"  "Don't you think it would be funny if we mooned the king during his monologue?"  

Wereasses are incredibly stubborn, and when others call them out on their misbehavior, they double down and make even more of an ass of themselves.  Even when it looks like a wereass is losing in combat, its sheer stubbornness will kick in and make it all the more difficult to subdue.  Brass weapons are one of the few ways to cow a wereass, and they avoid incurring the wrath of individuals with such weapons.

Wereasses are always in search of kindred spirits, which are most often found amongst adventuring parties.  Wereasses gravitate towards individuals who have little regard for the consequences of the world they engage with.  They will stalk this fellow jackass, watching with amusement as the individual careens through their adventures with reckless abandon, failing to take anything seriously.   Once the individual is deemed worthy, the wereass will approach as an unassuming donkey until it is close enough to bite its target and pass on the curse.  

> ##### Player Characters as Wereasses
