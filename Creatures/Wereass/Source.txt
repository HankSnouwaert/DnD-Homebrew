|  1  | A party of fledgling adventurers unwittingly travels through a **tiger's** territory.  After killing their travel guide, the tiger begins hunting the group in a deadly game of cat and mouse.|
|  2  |The party finds a wounded hunter who claims a **tiger** is hunting him after he denied it a kill.  |
|  3  | An eccentric dwarf maintains an exotic **tiger** zoo with questionable safety measures and offers the players a tour of his exhibits.     |
|  4  | A transmutation experiment on several feral cats goes awry, causing them to expand in size and gain the statistics of **tigers**.  The giant cats now terrorize the local alleyways.    |
|  5  |Every year a town sends humanoid sacrifices to meet their end at the claws of a **dire tiger** which represents their god's will.  Sacrifices are chosen from local criminals, dissidents, or travelers.  Failure to provide sufficient sacrifice provokes the dire tiger's wrath.  |
|  6  |  A **rakshasa** has taken on the guise of a local noble, climbing her way up the political power system.  Those who stand in her way tend to find themselves mauled to death by her pet **dire tiger** while on their travels. |
