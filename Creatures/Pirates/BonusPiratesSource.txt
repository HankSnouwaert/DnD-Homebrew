## Bonus Pirate & Pirate-Themed Creatures
The following creatures are a mix of additional pirates and mystical creatures that can be found in pirate-themed settings. 

### Fleet Mage
Many ships include a fleet mage among their crew due to their versatile array of spells. These mages can create fog for cover, conjure knives to cut rigging, and even fling kegs of explosives onto enemy ships, making them invaluable in naval engagements. Due to their constant proximity to cannon fire and the rabble of buccaneers, fleet mages are masters of concentration, able to stay focused even in the most chaotic situations.

#### Fleet Mage Tactics
Fleet mages can use *catapult* in interesting ways on a ship, such as flinging a casket of oil or a torch. 

*Fog cloud* can be a great equalizer in combat, as the disadvantage from making attacks while blinded and the advantage from attacking a blinded target will cancel out. 

*Cloud of daggers* should be placed at a chokepoint, such as below deck on the ship. 

*Misty step* can be used to infiltrate a ship if there are open portholes.

### Ship Saboteurs
Ship saboteurs are trained in wizardry as well as traditional espionage. They infiltrate ships through various methods, slipping past undetected. Once on board, they wreak havoc by pouring water on gunpowder supplies, jamming cannons, or even assassinating pivotal crew members to sow chaos. Many battles are won before they even begin, thanks to the actions of a single ship saboteur.

<br>

#### Ship Saboteur Tactics
Most spells on the ship saboteur's spell list are self-evident in their ability to sabotage or infiltrate a ship. *Arcane lock* is one of the most underrated spells for espionage, as it can be used to lock vital doors within the ship, keeping the crew out.

### Powder Monkey

Perhaps the strangest oddity produced by pirate wizardry is the powder monkey, a small elemental made out of gunpowder in the shape of a primate. They appear as ever-shifting black silhouettes, with trails of dark powder wafting off them. To break up their silhouette, they have two large burning orbs where their eyes would be and occasional red sparks dancing off their bodies. Powder monkeys were created by wizards who invoked elemental energies within stores of gunpowder. Their aim was to make self-loading ammo for cannons, but the monkeys proved uncontrollable due to their explosive nature. Escaping confinement, they spread throughout the seas and can create more of themselves if they have a sufficient amount of gunpowder. Powder monkeys form troops and inhabit gunpowder stores on ships or anywhere the substance is stockpiled.

***Unstable Temperaments.*** Powder monkeys have a tenuous relationship with humanoids, often invading ships' gunpowder stores without permission. In these cases, they are considered pests, though most crews are too afraid to anger them for fear of explosive retaliation. However, some reckless captains invite the creatures onto their ships, allowing them to live off their gunpowder. Such powder monkeys may become friendly towards the ship's crew and even help them with their firearms. A troop of powder monkeys can load cannons and muskets at breakneck speeds, allowing a ship to unleash a barrage of cannonballs and bullets at an alarming rate.

They can also produce small explosives to hurl into enemy lines, blinding or burning them.

However, their enthusiasm can lead to devastating consequences. They may become trigger-happy, firing cannons prematurely or lighting explosives too early, potentially blowing up the entire ship by accident. Powder monkeys are wily foes, as these elementals have no fear of death and will leap into battle for a spectacular, explosive end. Clever opponents may be able to detonate enemy powder monkeys while they are amidst their own ranks.

#### Powder Monkey Tactics
When working with creatures with guns requiring an action to load, this should be the powder monkey's primary role, using both its action and bonus action. Otherwise, it uses one of its three powders in the following situations:

**Smoke Charge:** Use this in confined areas or to force the enemy to move from an area.

**Flash Charge:** This should be the monkey's main powder, used whenever it can hit two or more targets.

**Explosive Charge:** Use this if the Flash Charge is not beneficial, such as when enemies already have disadvantage from another source or attacks already have advantage against them.

Once a powder monkey is at half health, it always leaps into the fray. Other monkeys may even try to detonate it using their Explosive Charge once it is in the middle of the enemy. 

Powder monkeys fear cold damage and will flee from it.

> ___
> ***Explosive Burst.*** When the powder monkey dies, it explodes in a burst of fire. Each creature within 10 feet must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5 (2d4) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. If the powder monkey takes fire damage, until the start of its next turn, the area of this burst increases to 20 feet, and the damage increases to 10 (4d4). If the powder monkey takes cold damage or if water is splashed on it, this trait doesn't function until the start of its next turn. 
>
> ***Evasion.*** When the powder monkey is subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
> 
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The powder monkey makes two attacks: one with its burning fist.
>
> ***Burning Fist.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage plus 5 (2d4) fire damage.
>
> ***Powder Fling (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** The powder monkey uses one of the following:
> - ***Smoke Charge.*** The powder monkey conjures a ball of smoke and throws it at a point it can see up to 30 feet away. A cloud of thick black smoke spreads in a 10-foot radius from that point, moving around corners. The area within the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.
> - ***Flash Charge.*** The powder monkey conjures a ball of flash powder and throws it at a point it can see up to 30 feet away. Each creature within 10 feet of that point that is not a powder monkey must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of the powder monkey’s next turn.
> - ***Explosive Charge.*** The powder monkey conjures a ball of explosive powder and throws it at a point it can see up to 30 feet away. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 7 (2d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> ### Bonus Action
> ***Monkey Business.*** The powder monkey can use a bonus action to load a weapon with the Loading property, use a magic item, or load a siege weapon.

### Paragriffon
A close relative of the griffin, the paragriffon has the colorful head of a parrot and the body of a jaguar, adorned with vibrant patterns that complement its head. Despite not being as strong as regular griffins, they compensate with superior wit and piercing screeches capable of shattering glass.

Paragriffons live in small prides in the tops of jungle canopies, nesting together. Unlike their omnivorous counterparts, paragriffons primarily subsist on fruit, though they will occasionally work together to take down larger game. While not as stealthy or fast as their more vicious cousins, they move through jungle canopies with ease. They can release ear-piercing screeches and even use basic bardic magic to mimic and distort the sounds of their foes, disorienting their targets and allowing them to close in on the befuddled creatures. However, these hunting endeavors are rare, and paragriffons prefer to dine on fresh fruit when available.

***Brash Mounts.*** Like other griffins, paragriffons are prized as mounts. They are far smarter than normal griffins, capable of speaking and communicating with humanoids through mimicry. They have unruly personalities, being cocksure, jovial, and showing no respect for authority. Even those raised from eggs exhibit these tendencies. Because of their personalities, many lawless ship crews have won over paragriffons with promises of succulent fruit and other finery.

Paragriffons that join a crew must be treated with the highest admiration and respect, or they will throw a fit. They mock and ridicule any crew member they wish and show off whenever they can, much to the annoyance of most of the crew. Despite their personalities, they form deep bonds and will fight to the death for those they care about. However, they will never allow their egos to be conquered.

#### Paragriffon Tactics
Paragriffons will use their Roaring Squawk whenever they can hit two or more targets. They will use their Mocking Squawk and stay out of reach of opponents most of the time, unless the target has a high Wisdom save or is capable of ranged attacks, in which case they may opt for their bite instead.

> 
> **_Keen Sight._** The paragriffon has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
> 
> **_Mimicry._** The paragriffon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Insight) check.
> 
> ### Actions
> 
> **_Multiattack._** The paragriffon makes two attacks: one with its beak and one with its claws. It can replace its beak attack with a Mocking Squawk.
> 
> ***Beak.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage.
> 
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage.
> 
> ***Roaring Squawk (Recharge on a Short or Long Rest.)*** The paragriffon lets out a horrid sound. Each creature in a 20-foot cube originating from the paragriffon must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 18 (4d8) thunder damage and is deafened. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't deafened.
> 
> ***Mocking Squawk.*** The paragriffon unleashes a string of insults at a creature it can see within 60 feet. If the target can hear the paragriffon (though it need not understand it), it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (2d4) psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

### Dredge

In the most dilapidated docks of fishing villages or harbors of lawless pirate towns, the creatures known as dredges can be found. Standing three feet tall with a round, pudgy build, they are covered in soggy, sickly yellowish skin. Their heads feature bulging eyes, and their thin lips stretch from ear to ear, hiding a mouth filled with missing or rotting peg-shaped teeth. These creatures are usually adorned in tattered sailor clothing, far too big for their small frames, strapped on with tied rags to keep them from slipping off. To top off their dilapidated appearance, they often wear large hats that once belonged to distinguished individuals. These hats are usually too large and cover most of their heads, leading them to cut out holes to let their bulbous eyes poke through.


***One Dredge's Trash.*** Despite their lumpy and degraded appearance, dredges are extraordinarily strong and energetic. They can easily lift a full-grown man over their heads and carry them for miles without tiring. Dredges spend their days in the trash-ridden areas of harbors, using whatever fishing equipment they have scavenged or stolen to haul whatever they can from the harbor. Whether it's junk, sea life, or actual treasure, the dredge's excitement remains the same for anything they pull up. If it is still moving, they will stick it into a net or sack and repeatedly bash it against the ground until it ceases to move. This behavior makes them a major burden on local seafaring communities. Not only do they steal fishing equipment from local sailors to continue accumulating collections, but their short attention spans also lead to them quickly losing interest in their previous hauls, leaving rotting fish and waterlogged junk everywhere they inhabit. 

This causes communities to despise the creatures and attempt to drive out these littering pests. However, locals often underestimate the dredges, who often deliver a humiliating thrashing to those who agitate them.

***Big Catch.*** The greatest hazard of a dredge infestation stems from their uncanny ability to find and drag sea monsters up from the depths. Occasionally, dredges will steal a boat or create a ramshackle raft and head out to sea. They then cast their nets and lines and, seemingly by random chance, pull up the most dangerous creatures the oceans have to offer, including sea serpents, dragon turtles, and deep-sea aberrations. With extraordinary strength, they pull the creatures to the surface or at least agitate them enough to cause them to rise. At this point, dredges either panic and flee back to the harbor or grovel and worship the monstrosity as their new god. In either case, dredge are either obliterated or forced into the service of the sea monster, which follows the trail of floating trash and pungent stench left by the dredge back to the town from which they came. 

#### Dredge tactics
Dredges have no real tactical acumen and lack the wit to adapt their strategies. Their primary goal is to use their fishing line to reel in the nearest threat and stuff it in their sack. Once they have it in their sack, they will flee if possible. Otherwise, they will senselessly attack the closest target with the stuffed sack.

> 
> **_Stench._** Any creature other than a dredge that starts its turn within 5 feet of the dredge must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the stench of all dredges for 1 hour.
> 
> ### Actions
> 
> **_Multiattack._** The dredge makes two Improvised Weapon attacks. It can replace one of the attacks with a Sack attack.
> 
> ***Fishing Line.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 60/120 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the creature or object is tethered by the fishing line. The dredge can then immediately make a tug-of-war contest against the tethered creature (no action required.) The fishing line can be cut by dealing 5 slashing damage to it (AC 10), and it has a break DC of 10. The dredge can only have one creature tethered at a time. (NOTE: Can creatures remove it as an action?)
> 
> ***Improvised Weapon.*** *Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. The dredge can use its sack as an improvised weapon if there is an object or creature inside it. If it does so, the attack also deals 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage to the object or creature in the sack on a hit.
>
> ***Sack.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be put in the sack. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature. A sacked creature is grappled (escape DC 13), blinded, restrained, and has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the sack. Dealing 10 slashing damage to the sack (AC 13) ends the grapple. The dredge can only have one creature grappled this way at a time. A creature freed from the sack falls prone at the nearest unoccupied spot. (NOTE: Did rewording, needs review.)
