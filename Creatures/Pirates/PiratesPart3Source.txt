## Pirate NPCs: Part 3

### Bombardiers
Bombardiers carry small mortar devices that can be loaded with various types of rounds, such as grenades, sprays of shrapnel, or heavy lead slugs. When a Bombardier assaults a vessel, it will be left in tatters.

***Storm Bombardiers.*** Some Bombardiers are trained artificers, infusing their mortar rounds with thunder and lightning. When a Storm Bombardier engages in naval combat, the opposing ships are torn apart in a wave of booming thunder and crackling electricity.

#### Storm Bombardier Tactics
Storm bombardiers primarily use their lightning grenades, aiming to hit as many targets as possible. They are also willing to target a single enemy with low dexterity if a lightning grenade is already loaded. When multiple enemies are within melee range, they switch to using their thunder buster. If opponents are spread out, they will use their thunder slug.

The target becomes surrounded in thunderous energy until the start of the Bombardier's next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, the target takes 16 (3d10) thunder damage, and the effect ends.
> * **Lightning Grenade (3/day).** The bombardier launches a grenade up to 120 feet. Each creature within 20 feet of the grenade's detonation must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If only one creature is in the area, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.
> * **Thunder Buster (3/day).** The bombardier uses its mortar to create a shattering wave in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (6d8) thunder damage and is pushed 15 feet away from the bombardier. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.
> 
> ### Bonus Actions

### Bone Saws
Usually the most crude and sadistic members of the crew, Bone Saws are armed with jagged blades that inflict terrible gashes upon impact. Even a hit to a non-vital area from these weapons can lead to severe blood loss.

***Filth Blades.*** Only the most twisted pirate crews allow Filth Blades into their ranks. Their jagged weapons have grooves that accumulate grime and rust. These unsanitary implements tear into flesh, leaving large, infected wounds. Even those who defeat these depraved warriors in battle often succumb to their injuries.

<br>

> ##### New Condition:  Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
>
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw, ending the disease on a successful one.

### Shanty Bards
Many buccaneer crews are accompanied by bards to bolster the morale of the marauders. When approaching a vessel they wish to plunder, the bard begins "Vapouring," playing songs and chanting to boost the boldness of their fellow crew members, riling them into a wild chorus. Opponents who hear and see this rabble quickly lose their nerve and often surrender before the fight even starts.

***Lead Song Bards.*** Few sounds strike more fear in a seafaring crew than the ship-shaking chorus of a Lead Song Bard. Adept in both bardic magic and the use of firearms, they intensify their enchanted music with booming gunfire. Few men can maintain their resolve in the face of such a performance. If the opponent does not surrender immediately, the bard delivers a flurry of bullets and biting insults to prove that their fear was well placed.
