## Pirate NPCs: Part 2

### Sea Dogs
Sea dogs are highly skilled in using harpoons to hunt wild sea beasts. They primarily earn their living through whaling and fishing, though in desperate times, they may join pirate crews. In combat, they are known for using their harpoons to impale and reel foes in so their allies can close in for the kill.

***Tide Hunters.*** Tide hunters are veterans in their profession, having been part of crews that have hunted many dangerous sea monsters to bring their corpses ashore for high profit. When a tide hunter focuses on its quarry, it is almost certain to be dragged out of the water.

#### Sea Dog Tactics
Sea dogs should focus on mobile, low-strength targets, locking them down and dragging them away from their allies so they can be surrounded by the sea dog's own allies. 

#### Tug of War Contests 
A tug-of-war contest is a special type of opposed Strength check between two creatures on either end of a rope.

While you're holding or tethered to a rope that is also held by or tethered to another creature no more than one size larger than you, you can use the Attack action to make an opposed Strength check against the other creature to try to pull the rope towards yourself. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. 

If you are more than one size larger than the opposing creature, you automatically win this contest. If the results of both checks are higher than the rope's break DC, the rope snaps.

If you win the contest and the rope doesn't snap, you can pull the rope along with you as you move or pull it towards yourself while standing still. If the opposing creature doesn't drop the rope or is tethered to it, it will be pulled along as though you are grappling it. 

You can't engage in a tug-of-war contest using a hand that is holding other objects (including other ropes).

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Tethered 
> If a creature is attached to a rope (such as via a lasso, harpoon, or a secure tie), it is tethered to that rope. Creatures immune to the grappled condition can't be tethered. 
> 
> Any creature that succeeds in a tug-of-war contest against a tethered creature using the attached rope is considered to be grappling it. The tethered creature can end the grapple by untethering itself, breaking the rope, or winning another tug-of-war contest against the grappling creature.

### Powderhands
Crew members renowned for their skill with pistols are known as powderhands due to the constant presence of black powder residue between their fingers. They carry a bandolier of pistols and can draw them at an alarming rate, unleashing a volley of shots as they close the distance between them and their short-lived targets.

***Powderhand Scoundrels.*** Powderhand scoundrels are master skirmishers, quick with both wit and reflexes. They can unleash a volley of bullets and a blur of sword flashes before an enemy can even draw their weapon.

#### Powderhand Tactics
In an optimal situation, a powderhand should move within 10 feet of a target and then back up as far as it can. Another trick is that if a powderhand is locked in melee combat, it can still shoot another target that is 10 feet away, negating the disadvantage of being within 5 feet of a creature.

### Crackshots 
The best marksmen of the crew are known as crackshots and usually reside in the crow nests of a ship, where they have the best vantage point. Crackshots eliminate the most valuable targets of an opposing armada with deadly precision and are greatly feared by those who normally try to stay out of direct combat.

***Trickshots.*** Trickshots are feared among sailors, and only the most renowned and wealthy can afford their services. What is most terrifying about these marksmen is their ability to not only assassinate a target but also cause the same bullet to ricochet and mortally wound or kill another unfortunate soul standing nearby. Many loyal bodyguards have died in vain, blocking a bullet from these sharpshooters, only to have their charge be slaughtered by the same piece of lead.
