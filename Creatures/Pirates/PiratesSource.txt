## Pirates
Pirates are a staple of high-seas adventures, bringing with them a mix of danger, charm, and lawlessness. Whether they are raiding coastal villages, battling naval fleets, or seeking buried treasure, pirates add an element of unpredictable excitement to any campaign. In this section, you'll find a variety of pirate NPCs to challenge and engage your players, from lowly crewmates to infamous pirate captains.

Pirate NPCs can be found in a variety of settings, from bustling port towns to remote islands and even aboard ghostly ships that haunt the open seas. These NPCs bring with them not only the threat of combat but also opportunities for diplomacy, espionage, and intrigue. Some pirates might be ruthless and bloodthirsty, while others might have a code of honor or a tragic backstory that reveals a more complex character. 

In this section, you'll find stat blocks and descriptions for a range of pirate NPCs, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities. For stat blocks with more nuanced abilities, tactics are included to help you use the pirate effectively.

Because pirates are known for their plundering, providing them with loot from the individual treasure table in the DMG can help reinforce this theme. You can load their ships up with gems, art objects, or entire treasure hoards to drive home how lucrative their raids can be.

### Crew Members

Most ships are made up of general crew members who possess basic seafaring skills and moderate proficiency with weapons. They are usually armed with muskets and cutlasses.

***Plunderers.*** More dangerous and notorious crew members are often referred to as plunderers. They make up the rank-and-file crew of experienced and deadly pirate crews and are known for their devastating raids.

### Duelists
Duelists are some of the most cocky members of a crew, wielding a rapier and dagger with mastery in one-on-one combat. Some pirate captains may even have them act as their champions in duels of honor.

***Master Duelists.*** Few duelists survive enough competitions to be called masters among their peers. Their egos are only matched by their exquisite swordplay. Such confidence allows them to force an enemy warrior into a duel through sheer intimidation. They never refuse a challenge from another swordsman, provided they believe their opponent has no intention of using underhanded tricks or magic.

> 
> ***Rakish.*** The duelist adds its Charisma modifier to initiative rolls and to damage rolls for its attacks (included in the attack).
> 
> ### Actions

> 
> ### Reactions

One creature that it can see and that can hear the duelist within 30 feet of it must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature and the duelist are obsessed with each other for one minute. While the duelist is obsessed, it has advantage on attack rolls. The obsession ends if a creature friendly to the duelist damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if the duelist ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
> 
> ### Reactions
> ***Uncanny Dodge.*** The duelist halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The duelist must be able to see the attacker.

### Boarders
Boarders are usually the most brash members of the crew, forgoing guns for melee combat. When a pirate ship closes in on another vessel, these warriors appear from amid the gunsmoke, swinging in with legs outstretched and delivering rib-breaking kicks to anyone unfortunate enough to be in their way.

***Bloody Boot Boarders.*** Originally inspired by the crazed rampage of the iron-footed red cap fey, these pirates adopted similar adornments for the bottoms of their boots. Swinging into battle lines like a battering ram, those knocked down quickly have metal-spiked boots stamped into their faces. These pirates now join other crews for a steep cost that is well worth the gold.

If the Boarder moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed up to 10 feet away.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Grappling Hook.*** The Boarder throws a Grappling Hook at a mast, railing of a ship, or other protrusion within 20 feet of it, hooking it. The hook remains attached until a creature within reach of the hook uses its action to remove it, or 5 slashing damage is dealt to the tether (AC 10).

### Bone Saws
Usually the most crude and sadistic members of the crew, Bone Saws are armed with jagged blades that inflict terrible gashes upon impact. Even a hit to a non-vital area from these weapons can lead to severe blood loss.

***Filth Blades.*** Only the most twisted pirate crews allow Filth Blades into their ranks. Their jagged weapons have grooves that accumulate grime and rust. These unsanitary implements tear into flesh, leaving large, infected wounds. Even those who defeat these depraved warriors in battle often succumb to their injuries.

<br>

> ##### New Condition:  Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
>
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw, ending the disease on a successful one.

### Quick Shots
Crew members renowned for their skill with pistols are known as Quick Shots. They carry a bandolier of pistols and can draw them at an alarming rate, unleashing a volley of shots as they close the distance between them and their short-lived targets.

***Quick Scoundrels.*** Quick Scoundrels are master skirmishers, quick with both wit and reflexes. They can unleash a volley of bullets and a blur of sword flashes before an enemy can even draw their weapon.

#### Quick Shot Tactics
In an optimal situation, a quick shot should move within 10 feet of a target and then back up as far as it can. Another trick is that if a quick shot is locked in melee combat, it can still shoot another target that is 10 feet away, negating the disadvantage of being within 5 feet of a creature.

### Crackshots
Quick Scoundrels are master skirmishers, quick with both wit and reflexes. They can unleash a volley of bullets and a blur of sword flashes before an enemy can even draw their weapon.

***Trickshots.*** Trickshots are feared among sailors, and only the most renowned and wealthy can afford their services. What is most terrifying about these marksmen is their ability to not only assassinate a target but also cause the same bullet to ricochet and mortally wound or kill another unfortunate soul standing nearby. Many loyal bodyguards have died in vain, blocking a bullet from these sharpshooters, only to have their charge be slaughtered by the same piece of lead.

### Bombardiers
Bombardiers carry small mortar devices that can be loaded with various types of rounds, such as grenades, sprays of shrapnel, or heavy lead slugs. When a Bombardier assaults a vessel, it will be left in tatters.

***Storm Bombardiers.*** Some Bombardiers are trained artificers, infusing their mortar rounds with thunder and lightning. When a Storm Bombardier engages in naval combat, the opposing ships are torn apart in a wave of booming thunder and crackling electricity.

#### Storm Bombardier Tactics
Storm bombardiers primarily use their lightning grenades, aiming to hit as many targets as possible. They are also willing to target a single enemy with low dexterity if a lightning grenade is already loaded. When multiple enemies are within melee range, they switch to using their thunder buster. If opponents are spread out, they will use their thunder slug

### Shanty Bards
Many buccaneer crews are accompanied by bards to bolster the morale of the marauders. When approaching a vessel they wish to plunder, the bard begins "Vapouring," playing songs and chanting to boost the boldness of their fellow crew members, riling them into a wild chorus. Opponents who hear and see this rabble quickly lose their nerve and often surrender before the fight even starts.

***Lead Song Bards.*** Few sounds strike more fear in a seafaring crew than the ship-shaking chorus of a Lead Song Bard. Adept in both bardic magic and the use of firearms, they intensify their enchanted music with booming gunfire. Few men can maintain their resolve in the face of such a performance. If the opponent does not surrender immediately, the bard delivers a flurry of bullets and biting insults to prove that their fear was well placed.
