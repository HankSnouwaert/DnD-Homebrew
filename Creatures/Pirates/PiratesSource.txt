## Pirate NPCs
Pirates are a staple of high-seas adventures, bringing with them a mix of danger, charm, and lawlessness. Whether they are raiding coastal villages, battling naval fleets, or seeking buried treasure, pirates add an element of unpredictable excitement to any campaign. In this section, you'll find a variety of pirate NPCs to challenge and engage your players, from lowly crewmates to infamous pirate captains.

Pirate NPCs can be found in a variety of settings, from bustling port towns to remote islands and even aboard ghostly ships that haunt the open seas. These NPCs bring with them not only the threat of combat but also opportunities for diplomacy, espionage, and intrigue. Some pirates might be ruthless and bloodthirsty, while others might have a code of honor or a tragic backstory that reveals a more complex character. 

In this section, you'll find stat blocks and descriptions for a range of pirate NPCs, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and unique abilities. For stat blocks with more nuanced abilities, tactics are included to help you use the pirate effectively.

Because pirates are known for their plundering, providing them with loot from the individual treasure table in the DMG can help reinforce this theme. You can load their ships up with gems, art objects, or entire treasure hoards to drive home how lucrative their raids can be.

### Crew Members

Most ships are made up of general crew members who possess basic seafaring skills and moderate proficiency with weapons. They are usually armed with muskets and cutlasses.

***Plunderers.*** More dangerous and notorious crew members are often referred to as plunderers. They make up the rank-and-file crew of experienced and deadly pirate crews and are known for their devastating raids.

#### Crew Member Tactics 
A crew member's musket takes a round to load and should only be used if they can find total cover from ranged attacks with no nearby melee attackers. Otherwise, the crew member will draw their scimitar and charge.

### Duelists
Duelists are some of the most cocky members of a crew, wielding a rapier and dagger with mastery in one-on-one combat. Some pirate captains may even have them act as their champions in duels of honor.

***Master Duelists.*** Few duelists survive enough competitions to be called masters among their peers. Their egos are only matched by their exquisite swordplay. Such confidence allows them to force an enemy warrior into a duel through sheer intimidation. They never refuse a challenge from another swordsman, provided they believe their opponent has no intention of using underhanded tricks or magic.

> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Panache (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The duelist attempts to compel a creature into a duel. One creature that it can see and that can hear the duelist within 30 feet of it must make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature and the duelist are obsessed with each other for one minute. While the duelist is obsessed, it has advantage on attack rolls. The obsession ends if a creature friendly to the duelist damages the target or casts a harmful spell on it, or if the duelist ends its turn more than 30 feet away from the target.
> 
> ### Reactions
> ***Uncanny Dodge.*** The duelist halves the damage that it takes from an attack that hits it. The duelist must be able to see the attacker.

> ##### New Condition: Obsessed 
> The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following  effects on a creature:
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability  except for a source of its obsession.
> * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
> *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

### Ship Boarders
Ship boarders are usually the most brash members of the crew, forgoing guns for melee combat. When a pirate ship closes in on another vessel, these warriors appear from amid the gunsmoke, swinging in with legs outstretched and delivering rib-breaking kicks to anyone unfortunate enough to be in their way.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

***Bloody Boot Boarders.*** Originally inspired by the crazed rampage of the iron-footed red cap fey, these pirates adopted similar adornments for the bottoms of their boots. Swinging into battle lines like a battering ram, those knocked down quickly have metal-spiked boots stamped into their faces. These pirates now join other crews for a steep cost that is well worth the gold.

If the boarder moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and pushed up to 10 feet away.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Grappling Hook.*** The boarder throws a Grappling Hook at a mast, railing of a ship, or other protrusion within 20 feet of it, hooking it. The hook remains attached until a creature within reach of the hook uses its action to remove it, or 5 slashing damage is dealt to the tether (AC 10).

### Bone Saws
Usually the most crude and sadistic members of the crew, Bone Saws are armed with jagged blades that inflict terrible gashes upon impact. Even a hit to a non-vital area from these weapons can lead to severe blood loss.

***Filth Blades.*** Only the most twisted pirate crews allow Filth Blades into their ranks. Their jagged weapons have grooves that accumulate grime and rust. These unsanitary implements tear into flesh, leaving large, infected wounds. Even those who defeat these depraved warriors in battle often succumb to their injuries.

<br>

> ##### New Condition:  Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
>
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

The target must also succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can’t regain hit points. At the end of each of its turns, the target repeats the saving throw, ending the disease on a successful one.

### Sea Dogs
Sea dogs are highly skilled in using harpoons to hunt wild sea beasts. They primarily earn their living through whaling and fishing, though in desperate times, they may join pirate crews. In combat, they are known for using their harpoons to impale and reel foes in so their allies can close in for the kill.

***Tide Hunters.*** Tide hunters are veterans in their profession, having been part of crews that have hunted many dangerous sea monsters to bring their corpses ashore for high profit. When a tide hunter focuses on its quarry, it is almost certain to be dragged out of the water.

#### Sea Dog Tactics
Sea dogs should focus on mobile, low-strength targets, locking them down and dragging them away from their allies so they can be surrounded by the sea dog's own allies. 

#### Tug of War Contests 
A tug-of-war contest is a special type of opposed Strength check between two creatures on either end of a rope.

While you're holding or tethered to a rope that is also held by or tethered to another creature no more than one size larger than you, you can use the Attack action to make an opposed Strength check against the other creature to try to pull the rope towards yourself. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. 

If you are more than one size larger than the opposing creature, you automatically win this contest. If the results of both checks are higher than the rope's break DC, the rope snaps.

If you win the contest and the rope doesn't snap, you can pull the rope along with you as you move or pull it towards yourself while standing still. If the opposing creature doesn't drop the rope or is tethered to it, it will be pulled along as though you are grappling it. 

You can't engage in a tug-of-war contest using a hand that is holding other objects (including other ropes).

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Tethered 
> If a creature is attached to a rope (such as via a lasso, harpoon, or a secure tie), it is tethered to that rope. Creatures immune to the grappled condition can't be tethered. 
> 
> Any creature that succeeds in a tug-of-war contest against a tethered creature using the attached rope is considered to be grappling it. The tethered creature can end the grapple by untethering itself, breaking the rope, or winning another tug-of-war contest against the grappling creature.

### Powderhands
Crew members renowned for their skill with pistols are known as powderhands due to the constant presence of black powder residue between their fingers. They carry a bandolier of pistols and can draw them at an alarming rate, unleashing a volley of shots as they close the distance between them and their short-lived targets.

***Powderhand Scoundrels.*** Powderhand scoundrels are master skirmishers, quick with both wit and reflexes. They can unleash a volley of bullets and a blur of sword flashes before an enemy can even draw their weapon.

#### Powderhand Tactics
In an optimal situation, a powderhand should move within 10 feet of a target and then back up as far as it can. Another trick is that if a powderhand is locked in melee combat, it can still shoot another target that is 10 feet away, negating the disadvantage of being within 5 feet of a creature.

### Crackshots 
The best marksmen of the crew are known as crackshots and usually reside in the crow nests of a ship, where they have the best vantage point. Crackshots eliminate the most valuable targets of an opposing armada with deadly precision and are greatly feared by those who normally try to stay out of direct combat.

***Trickshots.*** Trickshots are feared among sailors, and only the most renowned and wealthy can afford their services. What is most terrifying about these marksmen is their ability to not only assassinate a target but also cause the same bullet to ricochet and mortally wound or kill another unfortunate soul standing nearby. Many loyal bodyguards have died in vain, blocking a bullet from these sharpshooters, only to have their charge be slaughtered by the same piece of lead.

### Bombardiers
Bombardiers carry small mortar devices that can be loaded with various types of rounds, such as grenades, sprays of shrapnel, or heavy lead slugs. When a Bombardier assaults a vessel, it will be left in tatters.

***Storm Bombardiers.*** Some Bombardiers are trained artificers, infusing their mortar rounds with thunder and lightning. When a Storm Bombardier engages in naval combat, the opposing ships are torn apart in a wave of booming thunder and crackling electricity.

#### Storm Bombardier Tactics
Storm bombardiers primarily use their lightning grenades, aiming to hit as many targets as possible. They are also willing to target a single enemy with low dexterity if a lightning grenade is already loaded. When multiple enemies are within melee range, they switch to using their thunder buster. If opponents are spread out, they will use their thunder slug.

> * **Cabin Buster (3/day).** The Bombardier uses its mortar to create a shattering wave in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Shanty Bards
Many buccaneer crews are accompanied by bards to bolster the morale of the marauders. When approaching a vessel they wish to plunder, the bard begins "Vapouring," playing songs and chanting to boost the boldness of their fellow crew members, riling them into a wild chorus. Opponents who hear and see this rabble quickly lose their nerve and often surrender before the fight even starts.

***Lead Song Bards.*** Few sounds strike more fear in a seafaring crew than the ship-shaking chorus of a Lead Song Bard. Adept in both bardic magic and the use of firearms, they intensify their enchanted music with booming gunfire. Few men can maintain their resolve in the face of such a performance. If the opponent does not surrender immediately, the bard delivers a flurry of bullets and biting insults to prove that their fear was well placed.

Each other creature within 120 feet of the bard that can hear it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of each creature with temporary hit points from this feature for the next hour.

### Pirate Captains
The captain commands a ship of pirates <br> and maintains the loyalty of his lawless <br> buccaneers through bravado, cunning, and <br> audacity, as captains who fail to exhibit <br> these traits quickly lose their high position. <br> Captains are not only cunning strategists <br> and usually the best warriors among the <br> crew but also possess a presence that drives <br> their crew to  fearless daring, causing foes to <br> lose their resolve and surrender.

#### Captain Tactics 

Captains typically use their Warning Shot <br> ability before their All Aboard so that the <br> frightened targets can be pelted with <br> gunfire and left unable to get closer.

If the captain's forces are primarily <br> melee-focused and the opponent has a lot <br> of ranged attackers, it will use its All Aboard <br> ability first instead. Once a captain is out of <br> ammo, it will charge in if it has allies to help <br> it utilize its Opportunist reaction.

### Pirate Admirals
Pirate admirals are usually in charge of several ships of buccaneers. This is no easy task, considering the unruly nature of buccaneers. Pirate admirals are artful strategists able to seize any weakness that presents itself within their adversaries.

#### Pirate Admiral Tactics
Pirate admirals differ from captains by having Sneak Attack and Raise Morale abilities. They are reliant on their minions to help them consistently gain an advantage.

\columnbreak

### Pirate Kings/Queens
Pirate Kings and Queens are quite rare, typically rising from the ranks of seafaring marauders only once in a lifetime. To earn such an unparalleled title, a pirate must command a vast armada of ships and perform infamous deeds. Pirate Kings and Queens of the past have commanded fleets powerful enough to rival those of the nations they plundered. Indeed, many kingdoms have been toppled or brought to the brink by such hordes.

#### Pirate King/Queen Tactics
Pirate kings & queens use the same tactics as admirals, except they can gain advantage from their Ruthless ability to trigger sneak attacks.
