## Pirate Captain NPCs

### Pirate Captains
The captain commands a ship of pirates <br> and maintains the loyalty of his lawless <br> buccaneers through bravado, cunning, and <br> audacity, as captains who fail to exhibit <br> these traits quickly lose their high position. <br> Captains are not only cunning strategists <br> and usually the best warriors among the <br> crew but also possess a presence that drives <br> their crew to  fearless daring, causing foes to <br> lose their resolve and surrender.

#### Captain Tactics 

Captains typically use their Warning Shot <br> ability before their All Aboard so that the <br> frightened targets can be pelted with <br> gunfire and left unable to get closer.

If the captain's forces are primarily <br> melee-focused and the opponent has a lot <br> of ranged attackers, it will use its All Aboard <br> ability first instead. Once a captain is out of <br> ammo, it will charge in if it has allies to help <br> it utilize its Opportunist reaction.

### Pirate Admirals
Pirate admirals are usually in charge of several ships of buccaneers. This is no easy task, considering the unruly nature of buccaneers. Pirate admirals are artful strategists able to seize any weakness that presents itself within their adversaries.

#### Pirate Admiral Tactics
Pirate admirals differ from captains by having Sneak Attack and Raise Morale abilities. They are reliant on their minions to help them consistently gain an advantage.

\columnbreak

### Pirate Kings/Queens
Pirate Kings and Queens are quite rare, typically rising from the ranks of seafaring marauders only once in a lifetime. To earn such an unparalleled title, a pirate must command a vast armada of ships and perform infamous deeds. Pirate Kings and Queens of the past have commanded fleets powerful enough to rival those of the nations they plundered. Indeed, many kingdoms have been toppled or brought to the brink by such hordes.

#### Pirate King/Queen Tactics
Pirate kings & queens use the same tactics as admirals, except they can gain advantage from their Ruthless ability to trigger sneak attacks.
