## Gingerbread Monsters

#### Berserk
Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
 * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
 * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
 * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.

#### Quickened
A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

>
> ***Immutable Form.*** The ginger runner is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

>
> A broken part lands in a random spot within 5 feet of the ginger golem, becoming a small object. If its head is severed, the ginger golem is blinded. Its speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses both legs, it falls prone and can't stand up. With both arms, it can crawl. With only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to speed. The ginger golem dies if all of its parts are broken off.
>
> ***Gumdrop Button.*** The ginger golem has a gumdrop button, which falls off if it takes 5 or more fire damage or lightning damage from a single source. If the gumdrop button falls off, the ginger golem goes berserk for the next 10 minutes. While berserk, it is quickened and has advantage on all melee weapon attacks.

On a failed save, the creature is hit, takes 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone if it is Large or smaller. NOTE: Does it need arms or legs to do this?

### Gingerbread Monster Loot
Because gingerbread monsters are made of magical gingerbread, most of the valuables that can be harvested from them will be in the form of magical treats. These treats can be represented by *snacks of swiftness* (described earlier in this document.) 

Ginger runners naturally drop a *snack of swiftness* as part of their **Quick Snack** ability. You can let players try to harvest more *snacks of swiftness* from the remains of larger gingerbread monsters as well.

#### Looting a Ginger Golem
A player that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Cook's Utensils) check, can harvest 2d4 (5) *snacks of swiftness* that each expire after 8 hours. If the check fails by 5 or less (DC 10), 1d4(2) are found instead. If the check succeeds by 5 or more (DC 20), 3d4 (7) are found instead.

#### Looting a Ginger Colossus 
A player that succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Cook's Utensils) check, can harvest 3d6 (10) *snacks of swiftness* that each expire after 1 week. If the check fails by 5 or less (DC 13), 2d6(7) are found instead. If the check succeeds by 5 or more (DC 23), 4d6 (14) are found instead.

### Gingerbread Monster Tactics
#### Ginger Runner Tactics
The ginger runner is best utilized in chase sequences, leveraging their attitudes and abilities for swift and evasive maneuvers. In combat encounters, they excel in hit-and-run tactics, darting in and out of the fray to gradually wear down opponents. When paired with an ally capable of dealing significant damage, the ginger runner focuses on providing support to more powerful creatures. They use the Help action to assist their ally while using their bonus action and extra action (gained from being quickened) to stay out of their enemies' reach.

#### Ginger Golem and Ginger Colossus Tactics
Both the ginger golem and ginger colossus are simple-minded creatures with straightforward tactics and two key aspects to remember:
* **Blindsight.** Even if the ginger golem or ginger colossus loses its head, it retains blindsight up to a range of 30 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight.
* **Improvised Projectiles.** The ginger colossus possesses the unique ability to punt its own broken limbs. This is particularly useful if it finds itself unable to reach enemies in melee combat, turning its dismembered parts into effective ranged weapons.
