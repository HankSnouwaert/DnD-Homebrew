## Gingerbread Creatures
Gingerbread monsters are crafted by artificer bakers who infuse their baking with arcane magic, or by fey beings who delight in the whimsical merging of the natural and the magical. The creation process involves not just culinary skill but also a touch of magical whimsy, resulting in these animated treats.

These creatures come in various shapes and sizes, their doughy bodies adorned with colorful icing and candy. Despite their endearing appearance, they possess a surprising agility and energy, making them unexpectedly formidable. However, their intelligence is limited; they act more on instinct and whimsy than on any rational thought or strategy.

Gingerbread monsters are known for their naivety and simplistic understanding of the world. They approach situations with childlike curiosity and often lack the capability for complex reasoning or tactics. This simplicity can make them both endearing and frustrating to interact with. Their main strength lies in their speed and unpredictable movements, often catching opponents off guard. However, their lack of intelligence means they can be easily outwitted or tricked by cunning adventurers.

The remains of these animated creatures are as edible as any other baked good and can sometimes temporarily grant the consumer a burst of the construct's former vigor. Sometimes, their creators leverage this fact, using their slain guardians as an emergency food source or a means of quickly escaping a dangerous situation.

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
>  * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
>  * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.



> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.



> ##### New Item: Snack of Swiftness
> *Wondrous item, rare (200g)*<Br>
> When you eat this treat, you are quickened for 1 minute.

### Ginger Runner
Ginger gunners are enchanted gingerbread <br> beings, known for their diverse shapes and <br> ornamental adornments like frosting, <br> gumdrops, and other confectioneries. These <br> magically-infused creatures possess an <br> unbounded energy and a blend of arrogance <br> and naivety. They firmly believe in their <br> unmatched speed and frequently challenge any <br> creature they encounter to a chase. However, their <br> gullibility is their downfall, often leading to them <br> falling prey to deceit.

Their antagonistic nature and naivety often <br> result in a short lifespan, and their fragility ensures <br> they rarely survive their first mistake. These <br> constructs are unpredictable, often escaping their <br> creators' control. They are sometimes accidentally <br> created during magical pastry experiments or with <br> the unintentional use of enchanted ingredients. Some <br> are intentionally brought to life by artificers showcasing <br> their prowess, hags using them as lures, or trickster fey causing mischief in towns.

### Ginger Golem
Ginger Golems are colossal constructs <br> formed from large quantities of <br> gingerbread, baked in an eldritch oven, <br> and adorned with runic markings using <br> frosting and gumdrops. They house a trapped <br> elemental spirit, but like flesh golems, they are <br> not ideal vessels for such spirits. Possessing the <br> cognition of a toddler, they exhibit a joyful <Br> innocence and can be easily charmed.

Despite their imposing size, ginger golems have <br> several vulnerabilities. They fiercely protect their decorations, and if these are damaged, they enter a <br> relentless rage. While their gingerbread bodies <br> are magically fortified, they remain brittle and prone to damage in combat, often losing limbs or heads. Many artificers view them as inferior to more durable golems, <br> yet some communities, like gnomish villages, cherish them <br> as guardians and companions, enjoying their childlike quirks.

### Ginger Colossus
The ginger colossus represents a <br> titanic version of the ginger golem, <br> requiring the collaboration of many <br> skilled magical bakers or a single <br> creator of legendary talent. These <br> colossal guardians are the stuff of fables <br> and tall tales, often portrayed as tools of <br> vengeance or justice. Legends recount tales <br> of ginger colossi tearing down the castles of <br> arrogant rulers and acting as instruments of <br> retribution against those who scorned their <br> subjects, symbolizing the downfall of haughty <br> kingdoms at the hands of a giant baked good.

On a failed save, the creature is hit, takes 23 (3d10 + 7) bludgeoning damage, and is knocked prone if it is Large or smaller.

### Gingerbread Monster Tactics
#### Ginger Runner Tactics
The ginger runner is best utilized in chase sequences, leveraging their attitudes and abilities for swift and evasive maneuvers. In combat encounters, they excel in hit-and-run tactics, darting in and out of the fray to gradually wear down opponents. When paired with an ally capable of dealing significant damage, the ginger runner focuses on providing support to more powerful creatures. They use the Help action to assist their ally while using their bonus action and extra action (gained from being quickened) to stay out of their enemies' reach.

#### Ginger Golem and Ginger Colossus Tactics
Both the ginger golem and ginger colossus are simple-minded creatures with straightforward tactics and two key aspects to remember:
* **Blindsight.** Even if the ginger golem or ginger colossus loses its head, it retains blindsight up to a range of 30 feet, allowing it to perceive its surroundings without relying on sight.
* **Improvised Projectiles.** The ginger colossus possesses the unique ability to punt its own broken limbs. This is particularly useful if it finds itself unable to reach enemies in melee combat, turning its dismembered parts into effective ranged weapons.

### Gingerbread Monster Loot
Because gingerbread monsters are made of magical gingerbread, most of the valuables that can be harvested from them will be in the form of magical treats. These treats can be represented by *snacks of swiftness* (described earlier in this document.) 

Ginger runners naturally drop a *snack of swiftness* as part of their **Quick Snack** ability. You can let players try to harvest more *snacks of swiftness* from the remains of larger gingerbread monsters as well.

#### Looting a Ginger Golem
A player that succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Cook's Utensils) check, can harvest 2d4 (5) *snacks of swiftness* that each expire after 8 hours. If the check fails by 5 or less (DC 10), 1d4(2) are found instead. If the check succeeds by 5 or more (DC 20), 3d4 (7) are found instead.

#### Looting a Ginger Colossus 
A player that succeeds on a DC 18 Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Cook's Utensils) check, can harvest 3d6 (10) *snacks of swiftness* that each expire after 1 week. If the check fails by 5 or less (DC 13), 2d6(7) are found instead. If the check succeeds by 5 or more (DC 23), 4d6 (14) are found instead.
