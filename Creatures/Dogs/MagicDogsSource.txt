> ##### Variant: Miniature Blink Dog Familiar
> Some miniature blink dogs are willing to serve spellcasters as a familiar or are granted to warlocks by archfey patrons. Such miniature blink dogs have the following additional trait. <Br>
***Familiar.*** The dog can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the dog senses as long as they  are within 1 mile of each other. While the dog is within 10 feet of its companion, whenever either one teleports, the other may choose to teleport to the same space provided both can fit in the same spot. At any time and for any reason, the dog can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
