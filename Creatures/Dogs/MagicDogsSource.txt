## Magical Dogs
Listed here, in are magical canines for use in your games.

### Bolt Hound
These elemental hounds enter from the Elemental Plane of Air into the Material Plane via mountain tops and race across rocky environments at high speeds. Though not malicious by nature, they have a strong prey drive and chase after anything that runs, relentlessly hunting it down with lighting-powered bites. Some ambitious individuals attempt to catch or summon these elementals in hopes of utilizing them as high-speed shock troops. This usually has mixed results, as bolt hounds are as unpredictable as lightning and rarely follow commands that involve anything more than chasing someone or something down.

## Celestial Hounds

### Aralez
These celestials appear as winged dogs or wolves and act as rescue dogs in service of the higher planes. They dive down from the heavens, searching for virtuous souls who have been gravely injured. When they find such individuals, aralezes lick their wounds, magically healing grievous injuries and sometimes even bringing individuals back to life.

Aralezes are said to serve halfling gods and were created by them to safeguard halfling-kind. Others believe them to be the souls of faithful halfling-riding dogs who are continuing their service into the afterlife. Regardless of their origin, these faithful hounds are drawn to halfling clerics and paladins acting on behalf of their gods. When aiding such individuals, they are fearless and loyal guardians and even, occasionally, divine steeds.

### Chamrosh 
These celestial creatures combine canine and bird features. They possess the body of an enormous hound with the head, wings, and talons of a predatory bird. These features make chamroshes adept at flying down and snatching up foes who have incurred their wrath.

>
> ***Smell Evil and Good.*** The aralez is under the effects of the *detect evil and good* spell at all times.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Reprimanding Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) radiant damage.  If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma or be knocked prone and become unable to stand up until the end of the aralez’s next turn.
>
> ***Healing Lick (3/Day).*** The aralez licks another creature, causing it to magically regain 12 (2d8 + 3) hit points.
>
> ***Revivifing Lick (1/Day).*** The aralez licks another creature that has died within the last hour. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This ability can’t return a creature to life that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Safeguard.*** When a creature within 5 feet of the aralez takes damage, the aralez can choose to take that damage instead. This feature doesn't transfer any other effects that might accompany the damage, and this damage can't be reduced in any way.

Chamroshes serve gods of nature and the harvest by helping to spread seeds and promote the growth of plant life. They protect trees important to divine beings, and when those trees produce seeds, camroshes descend from their celestial home and spread them far and wide with mighty gusts from their wings.

This year, the aralez did not come, for it has been captured by dark cultists trying to coerce it into revivifying their recently deceased leader, who is being preserved by a *gentle repose* spell.

Chamroshes often work with druids and other woodland protectors to keep their sacred plant life safe. When they come across anyone who would defile or recklessly destroy plant life, chamroshes ruthlessly hunt them down without hesitation. Especially dangerous foes are entangled in plant life the chamrosh calls upon to aid it, leaving them easy prey for the chamrosh’s devastating talons.

## Flood Hound

These elemental hounds are summoned from the Elemental Plane of Water to serve as master trackers. They possess supernatural powers of detection beyond that of ordinary hounds and can stay on the trail of quarry miles away. The elemental nature of the flood hound allows it to pursue its target across land and sea, and it can even slip through tiny cracks and crevices, thus preventing most barriers from impeding its pursuit. Flood hounds are commonly utilized by wizards and marids to track down thieves, escaped prisoners, or anyone else who has incurred their ire. Once a flood hound is given its quarry, it pursues its task with relentless and single-minded determination.

## Miniature Blink Dog

As their name suggests, these fey are smaller versions of traditional blink dogs. Miniature blink dogs are slightly larger than a house cat but, otherwise, look no different from other blink dogs. It is unknown how this tiny variant came about, but the most popular theory is that they were created by fey lords and ladies who wished for smaller companions that were also an ideal size to hunt down troublesome fey pests. Most miniature blink dogs do live in the company of larger creatures who can protect them from more powerful threats while they, in turn, provide their services as watchdogs and hunters of smaller supernatural threats.

***Familiar.*** The dog can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the dog senses as long as they  are within 1 mile of each other. While the dog is within 10 feet of its companion, whenever either one teleports, the other may choose to teleport to the same space provided both can fit in the same spot. At any time and for any reason, the dog can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
