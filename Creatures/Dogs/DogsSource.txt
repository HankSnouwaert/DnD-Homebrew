# Dogs

These loyal creatures are some of the most common animals found living and working alongside humanoids. Though they come in many shapes and sizes, dogs are renowned for the bonds they form with their humanoid owners and the reliability with which they can be trained and commanded. They can be found throughout the societies of many different types of humanoids and across many cultures, serving valued and beloved roles.

Descended from wolves, dogs diverged into various breeds, all specialized in different tasks. From small dogs for hunting vermin to preceptive tracking hounds, vicious guard dogs, and agile herding dogs, humanoids have bred dogs to fill every role possible. Different mixed breeds may even result in hounds with unusual combinations of abilities, such as nimble dogs capable of dragging down larger opponents or sled dogs with keen senses able to detect dangers from a great distance.

Some dog breeds even possess magical traits. These traits may result from living in an innately magical environment, interbreeding with supernatural creatures, or arcane experiments. These exotic breeds are often found serving supernatural beings or living with non-human races, particularly those with ties to the Feywild, such as elves and gnomes.

## Dog Traits

To create custom dogs representing different breeds, you can apply any of the following traits to a dog stat block. For every three traits you apply, increase its CR by one level. Some traits are more powerful and count as applying more than one trait for this purpose. Traits should be applied in groups of three to keep the power levels of dogs of the same CR consistent. 

**Agile.** The dog has proficiency in Dexterity saving throws and increases the Dexterity bonus to its AC by +1.

**Gripping Bite.** The dog's bite grapples on hit (escape DC equal to the Strength save DC from its bite attack.) Until this grapple ends, the dog can't bite another target.

**Guardian.** Immediately after a creature within 5 feet of the dog takes the Disengage action or hits a target other than the dog with an attack, the dog can make an opportunity attack against that creature.

**Tough.** The dog has proficiency in Constitution saving throws, and its hit points are increased by 4.

**Pack Tactics (counts as 2 traits).** The dog has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dog's allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**Powerful.** The dog has proficiency in Strength saving throws and is one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.

**Rat Hunter.** The dog can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing. It also has advantage on attacks against tiny-sized creatures or swarms made up of tiny creatures, and it ignores the damage resistance of tiny creatures or swarms made of tiny creatures.

**Team Initiator.** Immediately after the dog rolls for initiative, it can swap its result with the result of one willing ally that also rolled initiative for the same combat. It can't make this swap if it or the ally is incapacitated.

**Tracker.** The dog has expertise in Perception and can detect creatures up to 10 miles away with its smell.

**Strong Willed.** The dog has proficiency in Wisdom saving throws, and it has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

**Swift.** The dog's walking speed increases by 10 feet.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

**Swimmer.** The dog has a swim speed of 30 feet.

**Watchdog.** The dog has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised.


### Magical Dog Traits
These traits are supernatural in nature and can be used to make dogs with magical abilities. 

**Fey Hunter.** If a creature is hit by the dog's bite attack, then until the start of that creature's next turn, if it tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel, it must first make a Charisma saving throw (DC equal to the Strength save DC from the dog's bite attack.) On a success, the creature can use that magic. On a failure, the creature can't teleport and wastes the use of the spell or effect. 

**Homing Sense (Counts as 2 traits).** If the dog is given possession of a garment or body part (such as a lock of hair or a nail clipping) to smell, it knows the direction and distance to the original owner of the item as long as that creature is within 50 miles. The dog can have only have one such quarry at a time.

**Two-Headed (Counts as 3 traits).** The dog has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. It can also make two bite attacks as an action and can grapple two creatures at once.

**Smell Evil and Good (Counts as 2 traits).** The dog is under the effects of the *detect evil and good* spell at all times.

**Smell Magic (Counts as 2 traits)**. The dog is under the effects of the *detect magic* spell at all times, except it uses its sense of smell rather than sight to detect magical effects.

**Spirit Hunter.** The dog's bite attacks are magical. The dog may also grapple and knock prone incorporeal creatures that would otherwise be immune to the grappled and prone conditions.

**Supernatural Senses.** The dog's senses are considered magical for the purposes of spells and effects, such as *pass without trace*, that prevent tracking through non-magical means.

**Wings (Counts as 2 traits).** The dog has wings which grant it a flying speed of 40 feet.

## Summoning Dogs as Steeds and Familars
The following rules can be used to add dogs as options for the *find familiar* spell and spells used to  summon steeds.

### Dog Familiars

When you use the *find familiar* spell, you can choose to have the familiar take the form of a **small dog** with one non-magical trait. The DM may allow you to pick the trait yourself or provide a predetermined list of different dog breeds, each with an appropriate trait.

### Dogs Steeds
When you use the *find steed* spell, you can choose to have the steed take the form of a **large dog** with three non-magical traits. The DM may allow you to pick the traits yourself or provide a predetermined list of different dog breeds, each with appropriate traits.

### Greater Dog Steeds
When you use the *find greater steed* spell (found in *Xanathar’s Guide to Everything*), you can choose to have the steed take the form of a **magic dog** with six traits that can be magical or non-magical. The DM may allow you to pick the traits yourself or provide a predetermined list of different dog breeds, each with appropriate traits.

## Example Dogs of Non-Human Races
The following creatures are examples of dog breeds that could be utilized by other common humanoid races. They can be used as they are or modified to better suit your adventure as you see fit.

### Dwarven Mine Dogs

These hounds are as stout and strong-willed as their dwarven masters. Despite their heavyset build, dwarven mine dogs are quite flexible and adept at squeezing through small crevices. These traits help them to fulfill their most common duty of clearing mine shafts of verminous pests hiding within small nooks and crannies. 

A mine dog’s second, and arguably most important, duty is to alert a dwarven mining crew of potential ambushes by other subterranean creatures. Their alertness and lightning-fast response time ensure dwarven crews are not caught off guard by such attacks, and mine dogs will always rush into the frey to protect their charges. In the most deadly attacks, mine dogs have been known to lay down their lives to ensure the survival of a dwarven crew. Such hounds are given a hero’s burial, and it is said they continue to protect and serve the dwarves’ ancestors in the afterlife

## Elven Hunting Hound

These prestigious hunting hounds are bred and kept by families of elven nobles who utilize their skills for sport and battle. Elven hunting hounds are most commonly found amongst wood elves, though members of high elven nobility often keep and breed packs of them. They possess an otherworldly grace akin to their elven masters, and they are bred almost as much for their beauty as their hunting skills.

Many elves claim the original hunting hounds were gifted to them by a grateful fey lord, while others believe they were once ordinary hounds who were slowly changed over time by the influence of the Feywild. Whatever the source of these gifts, they allow elven hunting hounds to pursue quarry through normally untrackable territory such as the confounding Feywild. It is said even the most elusive of fey can’t shake the trail of an elven hunting hound once it catches their scent.


Outside of hunting elusive beasts through magical wilds, elves also utilize their hunting hounds in defense of their territory. Elven lands are often enchanted in ways that hamper navigation through mundane means so as to confound intruders. Even expert navigators or dogs bred for tracking can quickly become confounded in such wilds. This makes them easy prey for elven hunting hounds leading patrol sentinels who quickly pick apart the would-be invaders.

## Gnomish Tricket Retriever

Gnomes are ever on the lookout for new curiosities and trinkets to experiment with. To this end, they’ve bred small magical retrievers capable of sniffing out otherwise hidden sources of magic. Known as trinket retrievers, these small rambunctious dogs are always eager to find new arcane scents. Gnomes will bring trinket retrievers with them when searching through scrap heaps to discover discarded objects that still possess magical properties. Despite their name, trinket hounds also find uses beyond finding arcane devices, such as sniffing out potential supernatural hazards in ancient ruins or detecting individuals under magical influences.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br>

Though for all their uses, trinket retrievers can prove to be quite hazardous companions. They possess a gnomish exuberance and carefree spirit that often gets them into trouble as they playfully seek out magical scents to experience. Unsupervised trinket retrievers can quickly run amuck in an arcane workshop, destroying fragile equipment and throwing experiments into disarray as they seek out their next magical toy.

## Halfling Riding Mastiff

Though halflings are generally not known for their wartime capabilities or battle savvy, when they must meet enemies in combat, they are known to ride into the fray upon mighty mastiffs. Though some of these steeds are essentially ordinary mastiffs trained to take a small rider, many halfling villages breed their own variants specially designed for mounted combat. These dogs are bred for solid frames capable of supporting riders and barding. 

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Even more importantly, they possess an instinctive ability to coordinate their combat efforts with their rider, whom they protect with their life.  Halfling riding mastiffs share the indomitable courage of their indomitable riders, and though they are big, slobbering, playful dogs in peacetime, in war, they are mighty steeds who see their riders through thick and thin. Many heroic stories and legends halflings tell involve a loyal mastiff steed that carried its owner onto glorious victories in the protection of their village.

|  2  |Dwarves have tasked the players with clearing a once-abandoned mine of deadly creatures preying upon their new miners. A **dwarven mine dog** is provided to aid the players in sniffing out the monsters.  |
|  3  | The players find themselves lost in an enchanted forest that impedes conventional navigation. A stray **elven hunting hound** stalks them from a distance, and if they can befriend it, it may help lead them out of the woods.     |
|  4  | An elven noble has tasked the players with hunting down a wicked but elusive fey creature. To aid in this task, the noble has granted them the use of his pack of **elven hunting hounds**.    |
|  5  |The players have been tasked with following a **gnomish tricker retriever** through a scrap yard as it burrows through the rubble, looking for magic items. In doing so, it regularly activates partially scrapped gnomish automatons designed to attack humanoids.  |
