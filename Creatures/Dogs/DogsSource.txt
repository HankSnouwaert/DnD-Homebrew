## Dog Traits

To create custom dogs representing different breeds, you can apply any of the following traits to a dog stat block. For every three traits you apply, increase its CR by one level. Some traits are more powerful and count as applying more than one trait for this purpose.

**Agile.** The dog has proficiency in Dexterity saving throws and doubles its Dexterity bonus to AC.

**Gripping Bite.** The dog's bite grapples on hit (escape DC equal to the Strength save DC from its bite attack.) Until this grapple ends, the dog can't bite another target.

**Guardian.** Immediately after a creature within 5 feet of the dog takes the Disengage action or hits a target other than the dog with an attack, the dog can make an opportunity attack against that creature.

**Tough.** The dog has proficiency in Constitution saving throws, and its hit points are increased by 3.

**Pack Tactics (counts as 2 traits).** The dog has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the dog's allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

**Powerful.** The dog has proficiency in Strength saving throws and is one size larger when determining its carrying capacity and the weight it can push, drag, or lift.

**Rat Hunter.** The dog can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing. It also has advantage on attacks against tiny-sized creatures or swarms made up of tiny creatures, and it ignores the damage resistance of tiny creatures or swarms made of tiny creatures.

**Team Player.** Immediately after the dog rolls for initiative, it can swap its result with the result of one willing ally that also rolled initiative for the same combat. It can't make this swap if it or the ally is incapacitated.

**Tracker.** The dog has expertise in Perception, has advantage on Perception checks that rely on smell to detect a creature or object it has smelled before, and can detect creatures up to 10 miles away with its smell.

**Strong Willed.** The dog has proficiency in Wisdom saving throws, and it has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

**Swift.** The dog has a walking speed of 50 feet.

**Swimmer.** The dog has a swim speed of 30 feet.

**Watchdog.** The dog has advantage on initiative rolls and can't be surprised.






### Magical Dog Traits
These traits are supernatural in nature and can be used to make dogs with magical abilities. 

**Fey Hunter.** If a creature is hit by the dog's bite attack, then until the start of that creature's next turn, if it tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel, it must first make a Charisma saving throw (DC equal to the Strength save DC from the dog's bite attack.) On a success, the creature can use that magic. On a failure, the creature can't teleport and wastes the use of the spell or effect. 

**Homing Sense (Counts as 2 traits).** If the dog is given possession of a garment or body part (such as a lock of hair or a nail clipping) to smell, it knows the direction and distance to the original owner of the item as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet. The dog can have only have one such quarry at a time.

**Two-Headed (Counts as 3 traits).** The dog has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on saving throws against being blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, or knocked unconscious. It can also make two bite attacks as an action and can grapple two creatures at once.

**Smell Evil and Good (Counts as 2 traits).** The dog is under the effects of the *detect evil and good* spell at all times.

**Smell Magic (Counts as 2 traits)**. The dog is under the effects of the *detect magic* spell at all times, except it uses its sense of smell rather than sight to detect magical effects.

**Spirit Hunter.** The dog's bite attacks are magical. The dog may also grapple and knock prone incorporeal creatures that would otherwise be immune to the grappled and prone conditions.

**Supernatural Senses.** The dog's senses are considered magical for the purposes of spells and effects, such as *pass without trace*,  that prevent tracking through non-magical means.
