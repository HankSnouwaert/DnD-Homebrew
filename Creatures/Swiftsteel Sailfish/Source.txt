# Swiftsteel <br> Sailfish

These swashbuckling celestials <br> take the form of dazzling sailfish. <br> Their divine origin is made <br> apparent by the radiant aura <br> illuminating their scales, casting <br> marvelous rainbow-colored <br> lights across their fins. This aura <br> almost seems to be a manifestation of the <br> sailfish's larger-than-life personality, and <br> wherever they go, they dazzle others with their <br> charm and confidence.

***Blade Masters.*** The extended nose of this <br> celestial is no ordinary natural weapon, but a <br> blade composed of divine steel. With it, the <br> sailfish can duel foes with the skill of an expert <br> fencer and look good doing it. On top of its raw <br> talent, sailfish's overpowering  charisma <br> leaves its opponents starstruck and unable to <br> defend themselves against its masterful <br> techniques. The sailfish combines all this with <br> its unbeatable swim speed to become a deadly <br> and difficult to pin down marine combatant.

***Traveling Adventure-Seekers.*** Swiftsteel <br> sailfish originate from the oceans of the outer <br> plane known as Arborea, a wild realm associated <br> with the chaotic good alignment. Thanks to their <br> intelligence and adventurous wanderlust, these <br> sailfish often find themselves leaving their home <br> in search of grand adventures, making friends and <br> enemies in equal measure. A swiftsteel swordfish <br> is loath to turn down an opportunity to prove its <br> metal or show off its skills, and they are quick to <br> embark on any sufficiently exciting quest <br> that will make for an epic story. 

When swiftsteel swordfish meet fellow <br> adventurers, their first instinct is usually to duel <br> the newcomers to test their worth, though they  <br> will rarely slay their opponents in these duels. <br> Opponents who fight well and display admirable sportsmanship will earn the swordfish's respect, <br> and it may invite them to participate in its <br> adventures or offer to aid them in theirs.

> ***Charge.*** If the swordfish moves at least 20 feet straight towards a target and then hits it with a slash attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of the swordfish's next turn.

>
> ***Blade Flourish (1/Short Rest).*** Each creature within 10 feet of the swordfish must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures under the effect of the swordfish's Panache Pattern ability have disadvantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7 (2d6 damage) slashing damage and is pushed back 10 feet. On a pass, the creature takes half as much damage and is not pushed back. After using this ability, the swordfish gains +3 bonus to its ac until the start of its next turn.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
> ***Panache Pattern (1/Short Rest).*** The swordfish dazzles and cows foes with its roguish confidence, forcing each creature of its choice within 100 feet that can see it to make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. If a creature fails the save, the swordfish has advantage on attacks against it, and it provokes opportunity attacks from the swordfish even if it takes the disengage action before leaving the swordfish's reach. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending this effect on a success.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Riposte.*** When a creature misses the swordfish with a melee attack while within 10 feet of it, the swordfish can make a melee weapon attack against that creature.
