## Keepers of The Forbidden
*Enthralling Masters of Pain, Pleasure, & Temptation*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Implements <br>
These greater demons are paragons of unfettered desire and destructive obsession. The forms they assume are varied, but they are all huge fiends with vaguely humanoid forms that feature an amalgam of male, female, and bestial features. These bodies sport arms that end in diamond-sharp claws, and they move at such speed in combat that they appear to be a blur of motion. They are both terrifying and beautiful to behold, their cruel and sensual forms entrancing and unnatural, breaking the wills of all but the most disciplined of onlookers. 

Keepers of the forbidden drive mortals to push every experience to the extreme, and those under their influence lose themselves in pursuit of new sensations and experiences. These pursuits may begin with frenzied artistic creation or the indulgence of forbidden pleasures, but they soon devolve into depraved acts of self-gratification and sadism. Passion turns to obsession, and each hedonistic pursuit must exceed the one that came before as the mortal quickly loses themselves in a spiral of indulgence.

These fiends eagerly partake in the cruel, hedonistic frenzies they induce, using their elegant great blades to masterfully cut a swath through awed onlookers, each slice moving with the grace of a dancer and each blood splatter painting the ground with the aesthetic precision of an artist. Even those who resist their charms find themselves facing a martial master wielding overwhelmingly seductive magics. 

To make matters worse, these fiends rarely work alone and are usually accompanied by cadres of sycophantic followers eager to please the keeper in any perverse way possible. These may be entranced mortal worshippers or lesser demons seeking to indulge in the keeper's revelries. Together, these debauched hedonists travel the mortal realm and perhaps even worlds beyond, causing unholy chaos and suffering in their eternal pursuit of extreme excesses. 

Those keepers of the forbidden who manage to achieve these excesses grow in power until they become known as exalted keepers of the forbidden. These demons are among the rarest and most powerful demons of excess in existence, for they have experienced sensations beyond the comprehension of most beings and are driven to experience yet more. They will bring about the fall of nations and wreak havoc across the cosmos just to satisfy their mad desires, and once their attention is fixed on someone or something, nothing can curb their eternal obsession.

### The Marquis of Delirium
Keepers of the forbidden typically corrupt their mortal victims by playing on their desires and edging them toward the pursuit of excessive material pleasure. Each pursuit leads to another, more perverse, pursuit as the corrupted mortal plunders the world around them in search of ever greater excesses. However, the physical limits of the material world eventually provide an increasingly difficult barrier to overcome as the obsessed mortal pushes for ever more depraved experiences. Even demons as powerful as keepers of change are limited in terms of the experiences they can inflict while they are within the confines of the Material Plane.

The Marquis of Delierim is a devious keeper of change who has found a way around this predicament. The experiences he provides are in the form of ever-changing illusions that partially dwell within the Ethereal Plane. The form these illusions take is limited only by the imaginations of their victims, and the more the Marquis's victims indulge in them, the more real they seem. Not bound by the laws of the Material Plane, the illusions provided by the Marquis shift and grow to meet the increasing demands of their obsessed onlookers. Eventually, the captured victims lose touch with reality and become trapped in an illusionary existence of ever-increasing depraved madness and terror.

\columnbreak

The Marquis visits societies where peace and abundance have created apathy and discontent. Those who are unfulfilled by their humdrum lives are susceptible to the influence of his illusions and often begin relying on them as addictive pass times and substitutes for more substantive pursuits. The Marquis takes delight in witnessing the degeneration of those who throw away their potential for his illusory pleasures, and nothing satisfies him more than inflicting this on a mass scale, potentially leading entire civilizations into ruin as their populations lose the will to participate in daily life.

Though the Marquis prefers to seduce victims with illusory temptations rather than engage in direct confrontation, he is more than capable of dealing with foes who would challenge him directly. In combat, the Marquis masterfully wields spells of shadow and illusion, unleashing nightmarish magic upon his foes. Worse still, his illusory minions, normally used to tempt mortals, can be turned into nightmarish apparations capable of driving onlookers to the point of madness, and the further the victims descend into delirium, the more vulnerable they become to the illusions. In the end, most who challenge the Marquis meet the same fate as those he seduces: lost in a shadowy world of ephemeral desires and endless terrors of their own making.

### Keeper of The Forbidden Tactics
Keepers of the forbidden wield a vast array of spells, a debilitating aura, and attacks that prevent foes from escaping. Below is the prioritized list of actions the keeper takes in combat:

**1. Dominate Monster/Dominate Person**
* Cast when the keeper can surprise its foes.
* Targets frontline fighters, commanding them to attack backline fighters.

**2. Phantasmagoria**
* Targets the area with the largest group of creatures.
* The keeper makes a claw attack against any creatures outside the area, dragging them into it to maximize the effect of its aura.

**3. Cacophonic Caress**
* Affects as many creatures as possible.
* Follows up with a full attack action.

**4. Power Word Stun**
* Cast on creatures concentrating on a 7th-level or higher spell.

**5. Multi-Attack**
* Use claws to Grapple ranged foes.
* Use the Soul Feasting Greatblade on targets suffering from debilitating conditions or those posing the greatest threat (e.g., creatures capable of reducing the keeper’s speed to zero or removing debilitating conditions).

**6. Slicing Shard**
* Cast instead of Multi-Attack if:
    * A target is Stunned, or
    * The keeper is unable to move or reach other targets.

**Reaction: Instinctive Charm**
* Reserved for powerful single-target attacks, such as a rogue’s Sneak Attack or a *firebolt* cantrip.

|  2  |A demonic cult leader summoned a **keeper of the forbidden** to subdue rivals, but the demon quickly made this "leader" into its pet and took control of the cult.    |
|  3  | A **keeper of the forbidden** has found its way into the mortal realm and amassed a legion of **demonettes**, **fiends of excess**, and mortal followers.  The ambitious demon now leads a campaign of conquest, plunging each city and town it takes into chaotic decadence and excess. |

### Keepers of The Forbidden Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Keepers of The Forbidden Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Keepers of the Forbidden New Conditions Reference



#### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.



#### New Condition: Obsessed 
 The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
 * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
 * While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
 *  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

#### New Condition: Rampaging
 The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
 * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;If no targets are within range, it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and then can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;If it is still not within range after moving, it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.
 * The creature can't cast spells or maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
 * Any charmed or frightened effects on the creature are suspended.


#### New Condition: Drowsy 
 This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
 * It moves at half speed.<br>
 * It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
 *  It can't concentrate. <br>
 * Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
 * The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

**Successful Constitution Save.** The creature takes 4d8 Psychic damage and is Frightened of you until the start of your next turn. While Frightened in this way, it can only cast spells of 1st level or lower.

**Successful Wisdom Save.** The creature takes 4d8 Thunder damage and is Dazed* until the start of your next turn.

**Failed Save (Either Type).** The creature suffers both of the above effects.

Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

At the end of each of your subsequent turns during the duration, the pendulum swings back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4.

___

You conjure haunting illusions—phantom creatures that swirl and whisper within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. The illusions whisper dark promises and unsettling truths that cloud the minds of your foes.

\columnbreak

When you cast the spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. Affected creatures in the area have disadvantage on Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration.

The spell ends early if you move more than 60 feet away from the point where it was cast.

#### Pit of Shadows

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A black cloth)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The size of the square increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2.

#### Power Word: Pain (Revised)

- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You speak a word of power that wracks a creature you can see within range with excruciating pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If it has 100 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails.

* On a failed save, the target suffers Crippling Pain.

* On a successful save, it suffers Mild Pain instead.

**Crippling Pain.** A creature suffering from Crippling Pain is affected as follows:

* Any speed it has cannot exceed 15 feet.
* It has disadvantage on all d20 tests not caused by this spell.
* Each time it takes a move, action, bonus action, or reaction, it takes 4d8 necrotic damage, or 6d8 necrotic damage if the action was used to cast a spell of 3rd or higher level. This damage cannot reduce the target's hit points below 1.

\pagebreakNum

**Mild Pain.** A creature suffering from mild pain takes 2d8 Necrotic damage whenever it takes a move, action, bonus action, or reaction. This damage cannot reduce the target's hit points below 1.

At the end of each of its turns, a creature suffering from either type of pain can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the effect ends.

*8th-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You speak a word of power that overwhelms the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails.

* On a failed save, the creature is Stunned.
* On a successful save, the creature is Dazed*.

A creature Stunned or Dazed by this spell can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### Slashing Shards
*4th-level  Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of broken glass)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous

___

You conjure a cloud of razor-sharp glass and launch it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 Slashing damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an additional 6d6 Psychic damage, or half as much on a successful one.

If the attack misses, the shards still graze the target, which takes half the Slashing damage and suffers no additional effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the Slashing and Psychic damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.


#### Unseen Lurker
*3rd-level transmutation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** 1 round
- **Classes:**  Ranger
___

Choose a willing creature you can see within range. The chosen creature becomes enveloped in a shroud of mist, enabling it to move with unseen swiftness. Until the start of your next turn, the creature's movement speed is doubled, it's Quickened, and it becomes Invisible along with everything it's wearing or carrying.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

On a success, the creature has disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.
