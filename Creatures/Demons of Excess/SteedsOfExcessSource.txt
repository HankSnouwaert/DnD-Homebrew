## Steeds of Excess
*Swift Mounts & Profane Hunters*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** None <br>

In the dark realm of desires that drift lazily within the realms of chaos, herds of strange creatures tread with long, raptor-like legs across gilded fields. A dazzling palette of hues adorns the throng of beasts, their silken-haired manes running the length of their serpentine bodies from muscular tails to elongated, smooth heads. Long, forked tongues flicker forth from their toothless, round mouths to taste the perfumed air for emotions.

Born from the deepest yearnings of mortal souls, these demonic stalkers can smell the feelings of longing emanating from their quarry. Each soul leaves a unique aroma lingering in the air, which the beasts can distinguish and track like hounds, even across realms of existence. As they close the distance to their prize, their whip-like tongues lash out to halt their prey, for their saliva contains a potent narcotic that numbs the muscles, overwhelms the senses, and fills the mind with intrusive thoughts of taboo desires.

Demonettes, who delight in toying with mortals, mount these creatures to aid in their cruel escapades. Demonette and mount stalk their victim, allowing it to sense their presence just out of sight, only to flit away when noticed. Periodically, the fiendish pair gives chase, letting the victim barely outpace them, within a hair’s breadth of the mount’s stupefying tongue, only to break off the hunt when the victim is drained—mentally and physically—to the point of collapse. Such antics may continue for years without end, as the agonized victim lives in constant dread of their tormenting pursuers. Eventually, these souls succumb, no longer fleeing, and allow themselves to be whisked away to an eternity of agony. For none can out run their own yearnings.

### Eternal Admirer
Eternals admirers are a variation of these demonic mounts, manifested from reverence and worship of false icons. Upon taking form, they seek out powerful champions or demons of great decadence, whom they unwaveringly serve, pampering them with soothing purrs, honeyed perfumes excreted from their hides, and strokes of their intoxicating tongues. These devoted steeds are prized, for beyond the pleasures they induce, they instinctively know the object their master’s twisted heart most yearns for and its location. They tirelessly carry their master across countless lands until the source of their desire stands before them.


When an idol of Chaos strides into battle atop such an adoring mount—or, worse, an entire entourage of swooning beasts—they are lavished with exuberant praise, bolstering their already inflamed egos and driving them to perform grand acts of martial prowess.


### Steeds of Excess and Eternal Admirer Tactics
Steeds of excess employ hit-and-run tactics, repeatedly striking to poison their target until it becomes paralyzed. When guided by mounted demonettes, these steeds target creatures capable of dealing significant damage to the pair through means such as spells or abilities requiring strength or wisdom saving throws.

|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Endless Pursuit:** A prominent merchant’s heir has been haunted for months by a pair of steeds of excess and their demonette riders—always just out of reach, sowing madness with their narcotic saliva. When the scion collapses in the street, mumbling of forbidden longings, the party is hired to track down and stop these tormentors once and for all—or rescue the victim before they willingly follow their pursuers into oblivion. |
|  2  |**Blood & Silk:** Caravans trading rare silks and perfumes are systematically ambushed in the desert, their drivers found comatose beneath bizarre hoofprints. The party is enlisted as caravan guards—but soon learns the raiders are demonettes on steeds of excess. To break the cycle, they must guard not only coin but the caravan’s collective willpower, resisting temptations sown into their very minds.  |
|  3  |**Carousel of Cravings:**  A traveling carnival arrives bearing wonders—and a carousel of living steeds of excess that guests can “ride” for an otherworldly thrill. Those who dismount emerge enthralled, their ambitions twisted into dangerous obsessions. The party must expose the demonette ringmaster and free the riders before the town is emptied of its most capable citizens.   |
|  4  | **The Allure of Redemption:**  A fallen paladin, haunted by regrets, has bonded with an eternal admirer that soothes her torment with honeyed perfumes and whispered promises of redemption. When she leads an army of atonement-seekers into a neighboring realm, the party must decide whether to break the steed’s hold—risking her sanity—or find another way to thwart the crusade.  |


### Steed of Excess Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

## Chariots of Excess
Forged from gleeful dreams of sadism, the demonic implements of war known as chariot of excess carry demons of excess to the field of battle. Their elegant frames, woven from luminous metal, with a circular array of curving blades serving as wheels. When these nightmarish contraptions gain momentum from the laboring demonic steeds lashed to them, the scythed wheels scream with the echoes of past victims. As the chariot reaches its maximum velocity, the blades become a blur, sweeping though throngs of soldiers. Fountains of blood and confetti of bone burst skyward like macabre fireworks. Some are not cut down by the eviscerating wheels but are instead impaled on the brambled hull of the chariot and carried off. These victims will wish for the merciful end of being sliced into nothingness beneath the whirling machine, for the hungry demon riders guiding these vehicles of mayhem seize the opportunity to lavish cruel attention on their new passengers.

### Hellflayers
Hellflayers, deadly variants of chariots of excess, able to tear into the very souls of those caught within their cycling blades. Chunks of the victims’ essence are hewn off, blending into an incense that wafts from the chariot. The demonic crew basks in these potent fragrances, igniting a ravenous urge for suffering that drives them into hysterical mania, eagerly seeking to gratify their cravings. As hellflayers and their invigorated crews whisk through parades of violence, only the strange scent of souls lingers in the air, amid fields of crisp and mushy remains.

### Chariots of Excess Tactics
Chariots of excess are typically crewed by demonettes and pulled by steeds of excess. The chariot aims to charge through as many targets as possible, ensuring it does not end its movement too close to unrestrained opponents to maintain space for continuous charges. It avoids targets with high Strength to minimize the risk of being stopped. The crew can quickly dispatch any opponents restrained by the chariot.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

### Chariots of Excess Loot
These demonic chariots are extraplanar in nature and typically dissolve away when destroyed, similarly to demons. However, you may have these chariots leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the chariot that didn’t dissolve, or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the chariots to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where they were destroyed to see if they find any valuables formed by the corrupting presence of the chariots. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

|  3  | **Parade of Terror:** A once-peaceful village celebrates the harvest with a grand parade—only for chariots of excess to crash through the procession, turning floats into torn flesh and bone. The heroes arrive in time to see the chariots vanish through a shimmering portal. Tracking blood-spattered confetti, they must follow the trail into a mirrored realm of torment and stop the demon-crewed chariots from repeating the atrocity in a larger city.  |
|  4  | **Pilgrimage of Blood:** Pilgrims follow a centuries-old route to a ruined temple of atonement—only to find the trail lined with mutilated corpses. Investigating, the adventurers learn a cabal of depraved cultists has bound hellflayer chariots to unholy fallen knights, using them to harvest souls for a dark ritual at the temple. The heroes must race ahead to disrupt the rite and free the tormented spirits.  |
