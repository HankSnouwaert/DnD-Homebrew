## Hedonists of Carnality
*Lustful, Demonic Seducers & Cruel Sadists*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Implements <br>
From the unholy union of overwhelming physical pain and pleasure arise misbegotten spawn, lissome in form, each bearing two sets of arms. Their pale, claw-tipped hands wield instruments of torture crafted with unparalleled elegance. Every sensuous wound inflicted by their weapons prickles with heavenly bliss, the very purpose for which these debauched creatures exist. A flurry of such wounds is masterfully layered upon their victims’ bodies, crippling them with swelling exhilaration that renders them helpless.

Beyond their capacity to deliver such carnage, these demons can goad others with braided words, luring them to abandon common sense. Some are fools, falling for the creatures’ unearthly allure. Others, seeking to destroy the sadistic beings, are duped with promises of physical satisfaction in vanquishing the vile beast.

<br><br><br><br><br>

Yet, rushing heedlessly toward the tormentor, they leave themselves vulnerable to its blows, their righteous smiting swiftly corrupted into an act of dark ecstasy.

The epitome of this demon breed is the true scourge, for as they sustain lethal injuries, they are stirred into euphoric frenzies.

### Hedonist of Carnality Tactics

Hedonists of carnality aim to Daze and Grapple as many targets as possible during combat. Once a target sustains four Wounds, the hedonist shifts focus to a new target. They prioritize targets they have an advantage against, primarily gained through their Temptation of Carnality ability. If the hedonist has advantage on several targets, it will target ranged characters first.

#### New Condition: Wounds
While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:

 * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
 * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
 * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

\columnbreak

#### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
