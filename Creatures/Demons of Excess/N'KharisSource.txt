## N'Kharis, The Arch-Tempter
*Supreme Fiend of Excess & Defiler of All That is Pure*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Armaments <br>
In legend, there is an ancient sea where grey waters are churned by a relentless maelstrom that spins without cease. At the heart of this storm lies a beast, yearning for the most depraved of pleasures. Great was this beast, known in ages past as N'Kharis, the Arch-Tempter, for no other spawn of discord has led so many to sin with its whispers. It promised to indulge their darkest cravings, fattening their souls with depravity before consuming their defiled essence. So profound was the evil it fostered that wicked gods chose the beast to lead their fiendish children, spreading corruption across the land. As the tide of defilement rose, the Arch-Tempter drank deeply of the despair it wrought.

Yet through the darkness, heroes of the mortal realm devised a plan to end such atrocities. On a small island, a great battle erupted between the mightiest warriors of light and the Arch-Tempter with his depraved minions. The conflict raged for days and nights, as demons battered the defenders without end. The struggle continued until no brave soldiers remained, broken in a bloody heaps, with the monstrous horde converging on the last great champion, led by the great demon itself. The battle was vicious; the demon lord's claws snapped, and its enrapturing voice wove incantations of excess to break the champion's resolve. Yet the champion stood with conviction.

As he finally collapsed, a great spell crafted by the priests of light was completed, springing a trap.  The island was devoured by raging winds and waves of potent magic, washing away the demons and scattering their essence. The Arch-Tempter was torn asunder, its soul cast deep into the heart of the great conflux.

And so, the world's wounds begin to heal, and its scars faded over time. Yet the bitter beast's soul circled within its mystic prison, its harrowing cries breaching the barriers and drifting across the waves to distant shores. These echoes haunted the dreams of sleeping men, promising that all which transpires in while they slept could become reality if they surrendered but a small part of their spirit to be carried across the vast sea to the ever-turning storm. Over the waxing and waning of countless moons, the voice of the great demon has drawn shards of tainted souls back to its master across starlit sea. Soon, the gleaming hoard gathered in the eye of the demon's raging cage will grow so vast that it shatters the mighty storm. The island lying at the bottom of that great sea will stir, rising upward to breach the tides. The Arch-Tempter's body shall be remade, standing tall, proud, and monstrous upon the cliffs of the arisen island. From there, the beast will gaze over the vast waves toward distant kingdoms, weaving its impious promises to guide the masses from the path of righteous striving to the grand pleasures of damnation.

### N'Kharis's Layer
Where N'Kharis's wicked influence takes hold, palaces of decadence rise, constructed by enslaved mortals and cruel demonic servants. Within their cavernous depths, all manner of debauched acts unfold, indulging desires far beyond any earthly constraints.

#### Lair Actions
When N'Kharis rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or The N'Kharis dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 22 and can act of its own accord, always in N'Kharis's best interest. While active, the lair is aware of the location of any creatures within it.

On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair selects an unoccupied 10-foot cube on the ground within the lair and causes an Effigy of Sin to appear there, filling the space for 1 minute. The Effigy has an AC of 16, 75 hit points, and is immune to Poison, Psychic, and Thunder damage. It emanates an aura in a 10-foot radius. Creatures corrupted by N'Kharis's Aura of Temptaion trait within the aura have advantage on d20 tests and automatically fail all saving throws to end their Corruption. Creatures Burdened with Sin by N'Kharis's Aura of Temptaion trait within the aura have their damage rolls halved.

#### Regional Effects
Any region where N'Kharis dwells for a significant amount of time becomes warped by his magic, creating the following effects within 10 miles of his lair:

If a humanoid spends at least 1 hour within 1 mile of the lair, that creature must succeed on a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw or descend into madness, as determined by the Madness of Excess table. After making this saving throw, it can't be affected by this regional effect again for 24 hours.

#### Epic N'Kharis Battle
If you wish to make The N'Kharis into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 1113, and give him the Willing Prey trait, described below. This increases his CR to 28.

***Willing Prey (Recharges after a short or long rest).*** If N'Kharis becomes Bloodied (556 HP), he may end any spells affecting him. Additionally, for the next hour, on initiative count 1 (losing ties), N'Kharis telepathically offers each non-Incapacitated creature within 60 feet of him who isn't Corrupted by his Aura of Temptation trait a chance to offer him their soul. If more than one creature accepts, he can choose one. If none do, he can choose any creature within 60 feet of him. The chosen or willing creature takes 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, or 39 (6d12) necrotic damage if it is Burdened with Sin from his Aura of Temptation trait. If this damage reduces a creature to 0 hit points, the creature dies, and N'Kharis regains 50 hit points.

\columnbreak

##### Madness of Excess Effects
| 1d6  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|
| 1  | **Avarice.** The creature can't willingly let go of any objects. It takes 1 psychic damage whenever an item is taken from it.|
| 2  | **Carnality.** When the creature gains this madness, it becomes Charmed by all other creatures. If a creature harms it, the Charm ends for that creature. Upon finishing a long rest, it becomes Charmed by all other creatures once again.  |
| 3  | **Gluttony.** The creature must eat a days worth of rations every 3 hours or suffer a level of Exhaustion. |
| 4  | **Indolence.** Short rests require 3 hours for the creature and long rests 24 hours to finish. |
| 5  | **Paramountcy** The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks.
| 6  | **Vainglory.** Whenver the creature rolls a 20 on a D20 test, it treats the roll as if it rolled 1.  

##### N’Kharis Adventures
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **Whispers on the Wind.** As a coastal town reels from a summer of strange, erotic dreams, villagers awake humming with unfamiliar longing—some vanish overnight. The party is hired to investigate the dream-haunting breezes, tracing them to a crashed shard of N’Kharis’s soul buried beneath the sand. They must destroy the shard before the Arch-Tempter’s voice spreads further. |
|  2  | **Stormbreaker’s Gambit.** The party uncovers an ancient ritual that can shatter N’Kharis’s psychic dominion—but it must be performed at the eye of the everlasting maelstrom. They charter a magically reinforced ship, sail into the howling gale, and plant arcane anchors on the churning waters. When N’Kharis manifests an avatar of his physical form, the heroes must defeat him to bind his wickedness once more. |
|  3  | **Corruptor of Dreams.** N’Kharis reaches into the dreams of the players, challenging them to face depraved challenges in a shared slumber-scape. The players must navigate a twisting labyrinth formed from their own secret desires to face N’Kharis and banish him from their hearts for good.  |
|  4  | **Eye of the Tempter.** A remote lighthouse built atop a sunken fortress has become the pivot of N’Kharis’s planar breach. Inside its depths lies an obsidian mirror that serves as his eye, projecting his will into the world. The party delves through flooded corridors, bypasses soul-eating wards, and faces the mirror’s guardians—until at last the glass shatters, and N’Kharis’s visage steps through to parley… or to kill. |

> ### Traits
>
> ***Aura of Temptation.*** On initiative count 30 (losing ties), N'Kharis telepathically offers each non-Incapacitated creature within 60 feet of it the Gift of Corruption. If more than one creature accepts, N'Kharis can choose one. If none accept, each non-demon of excess creature within a 60-foot radius emanating from N'Kharis must make a DC 22 Wisdom saving throw. N'Kharis then may choose one creature that failed the saving throw to become Corrupted. While Corrupted, the creature experiences the following effects: 
> * On initiative count 29 (losing ties), the creature takes an extra turn under N'Kharis’s complete control. 
> * The creature can’t cast 4th-level or higher spells, can’t take reactions, and skips its normal turn. 
> * If damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies, and N'Kharis regains 50 hit points. 
> * Whenever a Corrupted creature takes damage or is subjected to an effect that would end the Charmed condition, it can repeat the saving throw. On a success, the Corruption ends, and the creature is Burdened with Sin for 1 hour. <br>
> A creature that is Burdened with Sin cannot become Corrupted or accept N'Kharis’s Gift of Corruption. 
> 
> <br>***Avoidance.*** If N'Kharis is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
>
> ***Blurred Movement.*** Attack rolls against N'Kharis have disadvantage unless its speed is 10 ft. or lower or it is Incapacitated.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** N'Kharis makes three attacks.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 22 (3d10 + 6) Bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is Grappled (escape DC 21) by one of N'Kharis’s two claws.
>
> ***Witstealer.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d6 + 6) Slashing damage plus 10 (3d6) Psychic. If the target is Charmed, Drowsy*, Frightened, Obsessed*, or Rampaging*, it is Dazed* until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** N'Kharis casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks): <br>
> *At will:* *dispel magic*, *nystul’s magic aura* (self only), *phantasmagoria***, *slashing shards*** <br>
> *1/day each:* *cacophonic call***, *glibness*, *power word: stun***, *project image* <br>
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***War Caster.*** When N'Kharis uses his action to cast an at-will spell, he can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.
>
> ### Reactions
>
> ***Instinctive Charm.***  *Trigger:* When a creature N'Kharis can see within 120 feet of it makes an attack roll against it. <br>
> *Response:* The attacker must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 22. *Failure:* The attacker must target another creature within range of the attack other than N'Kharis. If multiple creatures are within range, the attacker chooses which one to target. If no other creatures are within range, the attack is wasted. <br>
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> N'Kharis gains two additional actions in combat: Soul Seize and Alacritous Strikes. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count, separate from N'Kharis’s. On the action’s initiative count (losing ties), N'Kharis can take one of these actions if it is not Incapacitated. It can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Soul Seize (Initiative Count 16).*** N'Kharis can move up to 30 feet. He then casts *command*. If the target is Burdened with Sin by his Aura of Temptation trait and fails the saving throw, it is Charmed by N'Kharis until the end of its next turn.
>
> ***Alacritous Strikes (Initiative Count 6).*** N'Kharis can move up to 30 feet. During this movement, he can make one Witstealer attack. If the attack targets a creature Burdened with Sin by his Aura of Temptation trait, N'Kharis can immediately make another Witstealer attack against that creature.
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If N'Kharis is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

### N'Khari Tactics
N'Kharis's tactics revolve around corrupting enemies. If no creature willingly succumbs to corruption, N'Kharis targets the creature with the highest health. Creatures that attempt to break corruption—either by dealing small amounts of damage or applying effects that remove the charm condition—become N'Kharis's primary targets, and he directs corrupted creatures to attack them.

#### Prioritized Combat Actions
N'Kharis follows this prioritized list of actions in combat:

1. Phantasmagoria
    *  Targets the largest group of creatures, ensuring as many corrupted creatures as possible are within the area.
    *  Uses a claw attack to drag creatures outside the area into it, maximizing the effect of its aura.
2. Cacophonic Call
    * Affects as many creatures as possible and will choose to affect corrupted creatures within a *phantasmagoria* spell’s area or near an Effigy of Sin.
    * Follows up with a full attack action.
3. Power Word Stun
    * Cast on creatures concentrating on a 7th-level or higher spell.
4. Multi-Attack
    * Uses claws to grapple ranged fighters.
    * Uses the Witstealer Blade instead if it can Daze targets.
5. Slashing Shard
    * Cast instead of Multi-Attack if:
        * A target is Stunned, or
        * N'Kharis cannot move or reach other targets.
##### Monstrous Actions
* **Soul Seize:** Used on a creature with sin that has the lowest Wisdom.
* **Alacritous Strikes:** Targets a creature with sin that is Charmed by Soul Seize or Feared by *cacophonic call*.

##### Epic N'Kharis Battle
* This does not affect N'Kharis’s tactics.

##### Lair Actions
* N'Kharis places Effigies of Sin near creatures with corruption. It also drags creatures with sin into these areas to reduce their damage output.

### N'Kharis Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed from the corrupting presence of the fiends. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)**, or **Wisdom (Survival)** check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### N'Kharis Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### N'Kharis Loot Table

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 | Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1d4(2) 20,000gp Items |
|  10-14 | 1d6(3) 20,000gp Items | 
|  15-25 | 1 100,000gp Item  |  
|  26+ | 1d4(2) 100,000gp Items |  


#### Example N'Kharis Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide some example names.


##### Example Legendary/Mythic Demon of Excess Item Names
|1d10 | 20,000gp Item | 100,000gp Item
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1-2 <br> (Bone)  |  Perverse Greater God Bone | Arch Temptor's Skull |
| 3-4 <br> (Fluid)  | Depraved Divine Blood | Arch Temptor's Blood |
| 5-6 <br> (Flesh)  |  Perverted Greater God Flesh | Arch Temptor's Heart |
| 7-8 (Hide)  |  Perverted Greater God Skin | Arch Temptor's Hide |
| 9-10 <br> (Metal) | Masterwork Divine Armaments | Arch Temptor's Armaments |

## New & Revised Spells

#### Cacophonic Call
*7th-level Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot Emanation)
- **Components:** V 
- **Duration:**   1 round
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock
___

You unleash an ululating scream that radiates from you in a 30-foot radius. The scream can be heard up to 1,000 feet away. Each creature of your choice in the area must make a Constitution or Wisdom saving throw (its choice).

**Successful Constitution Save.** The creature takes 4d8 Psychic damage and is Frightened of you until the start of your next turn. While Frightened in this way, it can only cast spells of 1st level or lower.

**Successful Wisdom Save.** The creature takes 4d8 Thunder damage and is Dazed* until the start of your next turn.

**Failed Save (Either Type).** The creature suffers both of the above effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the Thunder and Psychic damage is increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.

#### Phantasmagoria
*5th-level Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S 
- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard, Warlock
___

You conjure haunting illusions—phantom creatures that swirl and whisper within a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range. The illusions whisper dark promises and unsettling truths that cloud the minds of your foes.

When you cast the spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. Affected creatures in the area have disadvantage on Charisma, Intelligence, and Wisdom saving throws, as well as on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration.

The spell ends early if you move more than 60 feet away from the point where it was cast.

\columnbreak

#### Power Word: Stun (Revised)
*8th-level Enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You speak a word of power that overwhelms the mind of one creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails.

* On a failed save, the creature is Stunned.
* On a successful save, the creature is Dazed*.

A creature Stunned or Dazed* by this spell can repeat the Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. 

#### Slashing Shards
*4th-level  Conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of broken glass)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a cloud of razor-sharp glass and launch it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 6d6 Slashing damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes an additional 6d6 Psychic damage, or half as much on a successful one.

If the attack misses, the shards still graze the target, which takes half the Slashing damage and suffers no additional effects.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Both the Slashing and Psychic damage increase by 1d6 for each slot level above 4th.

<br>

> ##### *New Condition: Dazed 
> A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
