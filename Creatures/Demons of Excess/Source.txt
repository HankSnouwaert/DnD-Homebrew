# Demons of Excess
Demons represent the dark, chaotic impulses of humanity made manifest.  Different demons represent different aspects of this darkness, but none are so tempting as the demons of excess.  These demons are born from the mortal desire to overindulge in life's earthly pleasures.  In some worlds, these fiends operate independently to tempt and corrupt humanoids.  On others, they act in service to a mighty demon lord or demonic god who presides over the domain of excess and obsession.   

**Hedonistic Allure.** Unlike other demons, these fiends often present themselves as friendly to mortals, offering to aid them in achieving whatever gratification they desire.  Wherever they go, these fiends seek to drive mortals to self-destructive levels of debauchery.  If time and circumstance allow, this corruption can be done subtly as the demons work their influence across one or more individuals, slowly driving their victims to commit more and more depraved acts.  Over time, the victim's ability to delay any form of gratification wanes away, leaving behind a self-indulgent hedonist.

In combat, these demons can unleash their supernatural allure in a much less subtle way to temporarily impair and charm their enemies.  The fiends will use this tactic to reduce the number of combatants they face while swiftly dispatching any who resist their charms.  

**Ecstasy In Pain** While demons of excess prefer to undo their victims using their tempting charms, they are more than capable of dismembering their enemies.  When the situation calls, these fiends can move with incredible speed, closing the distance between themselves and a foe in the blink of an eye.  Their attacks are made with equal speed, and their agility makes them difficult to strike.  Regardless of how quickly they move, their motions are always made with sensual grace.

Even when excess demons resort to direct violence, their attacks are laced with perverse pleasure.  These demons blur pleasure and pain and their victims often moan with ecstatic agony even as they are ripped limb from limb.  Each of these demons' movements is made with erotic grace, and they relish every bit of pain they can inflict.  They even appear to take masochistic pleasure in their own pain, and will squeal in ecstasy as they are slain.

&emsp;**Daemonettes.** These hermaphroditic fiends feature a bizarre combination of alluring and grotesque features.  Their lithe, graceful bodies are humanoid in form but include demonic mutations such as horns, hooves, and crustation-like claws.  While these features should be repulsive, daemonettes possess a supernatural charm that causes onlookers to view them as paragons of beauty and desire.  Daemonettes can combine their charms to quickly undo the will of their foes.  The fiends will then ravage their helpless victims who remain enamored by their attackers even as they are torn apart.

Daemonettes often serve as the primary servants for demonic lords of excess.  They can fulfill the role of spies, assassins, and foot soldiers.  Daemonettes are also dispatched to seduce and corrupt powerful individuals, bringing them under the sway of their demonic master.  

When they are not actively pursuing the agenda of their master, daemonettes exist to serve their master's every whim.  They are often found in the lairs of powerful demon lords, where they act as handmaidens, consorts, and guards.  When their master goes into battle, these sycophantic fiends eagerly join the fray, laying their lives down in hopes of earning favor with their fickle lord.

>
> ***Disruptive Song.***  While the fiend is not incapacitated, it can choose to sing a haunting melody (no action required). Any non-demon creature within 120 feet of the fiend that can hear the song has disadvantage on saving throws it makes to maintain concentration.
>
> ***Evasion.*** When the fiend makes a Dexterity
saving throw to reduce the damage of an effect by half, it
instead takes no damage on a success and only half
damage on a failure.
>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The fiend has advantage on saving throws 
against spells and other magical effects
>
>  ***Soporific Musk.*** Any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 20 feet of one or more fiends of excess must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of the *slow* spell until the end of the creature's next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Soporific Musk of all Fiends of Excess for 1 hour. The save DC for this effect increases by 2 for each fiend of excess within 20 feet of the target, up to a maximum DC of 20.  
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The fiend makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its sting. 
>
> ***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). The fiend has two claws, each of which can grapple only one target.
>
> ***Sting.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 11 (2d10) psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. If its saving throw result is 11 or lower, the poisoned target falls unconscious until the poisoned condition ends. The target repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. Emptying a vial of holy water on the target also ends the effect.

&emsp;**Fiends of Excess.** These obscene fiends combine lewd human features with a mutated bestial form.  Fiends of excess gallop at high speeds, their long tongues tasting the air as they search for prey.  Their unfortunate victims must not only contend with powerful claws but a nubile scorpion-like tail.  The poison from the tail's stinger numbs the senses to the point where many victims fall unconscious.  Fiends of excess use this opportunity to toy with their new playthings, ravaging their helpless prey with cruel wounds.  Those who awaken are racked with pain as sensation rushes back, their final moments filled with agony as the fiend gleefully tears apart and eats its victim alive.

Fiends of excess often serve as favored pets and war beasts for more powerful demon lords of excess.  When unleashed upon enemy forces, they sing disturbing melodies that disrupt the minds of any who hear them, impairing the ability to concentrate on spells.  Opponents who engage the fiends in melee combat fair no better, and they soon find themselves overwhelmed by a coying musk that leaves them sluggish and unresponsive.  These fiends relish the chaos and disruption they sow and gracefully dance through enemy ranks picking apart targets with surgical precision.

&emsp;**Keeper of Secrets.** 
These greater demons are paragons of unfettered desire and destructive obsession.  The forms they assume are varied, but they are all huge fiends with vaguely humanoid forms that feature an amalgam of male, female, and bestial features.  These bodies sport four arms that end in diamond-sharp claws, and they move at such speed in combat they appear to be a blur of motion.

These fiends drive mortals to push every experience to the extreme, and those under their influence lose themselves in pursuit of new sensations and experiences.  These pursuits may begin with frenzied artistic creation or the indulgence of forbidden pleasures, but they soon devolve into depraved acts of self-gratification and sadism. 

Keepers of secrets eagerly partake in the cruel, hedonistic frenzy using their elegant great blades to masterfully cut a swath through awed onlookers, each slice moving with the grace of a dancer and each blood splatter painting the ground with the aesthetic precision of an artist.  Even those who resist their charms find themselves facing a martial master capable of wielding overwhelmingly seductive  magics.

> ***Avoidance.*** If the keeper is subjected to an effect that allows 
it to make a saving throw to take only half damage, it instead 
takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only 
half damage if it fails. 
>
> ***Blurred Movement.*** Attack rolls against the keeper have disadvantage unless it is incapacitated or restrained.
>
> ***Charming Aura.*** Any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 30 feet of the keeper must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by all keepers of secrets within 30 feet. While charmed this way, it is incapacitated. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if there aren't any keepers of secrets within 30 feet of the creature at the end of any turn.

> ***Multiattack.*** The keeper makes four attacks: two with its 
Elegant Greatblade and two with its claws. Alternatively, it makes two 
attacks with its claws and casts one at will spell.
>
> ***Elegant Greatblade.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft. , one  target. Hit: 25 (6d6 + 6) slashing damage.
>
> ***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is 
a large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). The keeper has two claws, each of which can grapple only 
one target. 
>
> ***Spellcasting.*** The keeper casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Charisma as its spellcasting ability (spell save DC 20):
>
>***At will:*** *charm monster*, *command*, *dispel magic*, *enthrall*, *nystul's magic aura*(self only) 
>
>***1/day each:***  *dominate monster*, *glibness*, *hypnotic pattern*, *otto's irresistible dance*, *project image* 
>___
> ### Reactions
> ***Instinctive Charm.*** When a creature the keeper can see within 120 feet of it makes an attack roll against it, the attacker must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the attacker must target another creature within range of the attack other than the keeper. If multiple creatures are within range, the attacker chooses which one to target. If no other creatures are within range of the attack, the attack is wasted.

## Demons of Excess in Your Adventures
