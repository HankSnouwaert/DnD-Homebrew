## Hedonists of Paramountcy
*Prideful, Demonic Spellcasters & Narcissistic Show-Offs*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** Arcane <br>
A truly ostentatious sight to behold, the Hedonists of Paramountcy arise from the desire for power that clutches the hearts of the most egotistical mortals. Adorned in royal dresses of flowing satin, their near-human forms are decorated with mastercrafted jewelry made of otherworldly metals encrusted with exquisite gems. Their demonic nature is revealed, for in place of legs, they are kept aloft by two slithering, tattooed tails that coil endlessly. 

These regal entities are megalomaniacal, striving for nothing less than to bend all around them to their whims and elicit unceasing praise. To achieve this domination, they artfully manipulate others by nurturing the same urges of vanity that have overtaken their own existence. The scheming demon praises mortals, giving them an inflated sense of their skills and self-importance, even granting boons to such targets to push their capabilities to the limit. 

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Such attention erodes the mortal’s humility, as monstrous pride supplants it, leaving them devoid of humility and causing them to denounce any dependence on others. Once corruption has taken its course and self-grandiosity isolates the mortal from their allies, the demon strikes, shattering all delusions of superiority and forcing the fool to grovel before their splendid master.

These tyrannical creatures wield more than just artful inflation of ego. So boundless is their hunger for supremacy that they can seize the winds of magic using great scepters, icons of their unquestionable authority. Such sorcery allows them to levitate, conjure whips of psychic energy that release ear-piercing wails when cracked, or force groups of lesser creatures into involuntary, humiliating dances for the demon’s bemusement. 

The most powerful among these creatures are known as the Epitomes, and are so persuasive that they applaud their adversaries mid-combat, delivering affected congratulations for their masterful attacks, leaving would-be slayers flattered and dumbfounded. Yet the true threat emerges when the demon’s superiority is jeopardized. Vitriolic spite boils within the monster, fueling its spells to new zeniths, allowing it to maintain its position of dominance.

### Hedoist of Paramountcy Tactics
These demons prioritize targeting isolated enemies and have the following actions:

* **Chaotic Pavane.** The hedonist's opening move, used when it can affect two or more targets, preferably frontline fighters or Quickened creatures. This spell keeps opponents separated, and the forced dodge action is ineffective if the target is isolated.
* **Vicious Lash:** The hedonist's primary spell, aimed at affecting at least two targets. The attack roll is preferably made against a creature with no allies within 5 feet, though the hedonist will not sacrifice hitting additional targets to gain this advantage.
* **Staff of Paramountcy:** Used when the hedonist is Quickened or cannot affect two or more targets with Vicious Lash. The staff's fear effect keeps enemies separated.
* **Words of Praise (Epitome Only)** This is used on any creature that has the Multiattack feature or is Quickened.


\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A !uickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

At the end of each of its turns, the creature repeats the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on a success. If it did not move during its turn, it makes the saving throw with advantage. On a successful save, the creature falls Prone and the effect ends for it.
