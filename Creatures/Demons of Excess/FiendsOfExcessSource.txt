## Fiends of Excess
*Sadistic & Hypnotic Tormentors*<br>
**Habitat:** Planar (Lower Planes); **Treasure:** None <br>
Fiends of excess are creatures born as if from some hedonistic delirium, their segmented bodies resembling a scorpion’s but adorned with soft, luminous skin instead of chitinous armor. Multiple rows of androgynous limbs grace their forms, two of which end in polished cloven hooves. The abomination’s upper body curves upward, flanked by a pair of gleaming pincers on either side of its upright chest. Its long, slender face ends in a forked tongue, and a wild mane of oiled fur flows from atop its head, cascading down its back. Ornate ivory horns spiral outward to crown its head, while its many eyes burn with a yearning for torment. Most notable is its coiling tail, tipped with a massive stinger.

These merciless and swift hunters hunger for flesh and souls tenderized by torment. Their heightened senses detect such morsels, and their multitude of limbs carries them across all manner of obstacles with a rhythmic gallop, each graceful step producing a hypnotic beat.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 As their strange, waltz-like movements bring them closer to their prey, the fiends emit a haunting whir—a subtle but intrusive symphony that nettles all who hear it. As the fiend descends with its deadly array of lightning-fast appendages, a potent musk bears down on its victims’ faculties, casting them into a haze that clouds reason, leaving them sluggish, stumbling, or lurching half-cocked in random directions. In rare cases, when a target is not numbed by this miasma, the fiend’s stinger delivers a sedative potent enough to render even a raging ogre weary and induce a coma. So overwhelming is the intoxicating presence of these monsters that a single fiend can plunge a well-trained army into bewildered discord.

### Fiends of Excess Tactics
Fiends of excess act as disruptors, diminishing their enemies' action economy. When allied with high-damage-dealing creatures, their primary goal is to move among multiple targets, dazing and knocking as many unconscious as possible while grappling targets with low Dexterity and Strength to reposition them unfavorably. When operating alone, a fiend of excess focuses on incapacitating a single target and swiftly dragging it away.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

\columnbreak

<br><br>
<br>
> ##### New Condition: Drowsy 
> This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
> * It moves at half speed.<br>
> * It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
> *  It can't concentrate. <br>
> * Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
> * The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

> ### Traits
>
> ***Soporific Musk.*** Any non-demon of excess creature that starts its turn within a 10-foot emanation originating from one or more creatures with this trait must succeed on a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 16 + 2 per each additional creature with this trait within 10 feet of the target, using the highest DC of these creatures if multiple are present. <br>
>
> *Failure:* The creature is Dazed* until the start of its next turn.
>
> *Failure by 5+:* The creature also takes no action on its next turn and uses all its movement to move in a random direction (roll 1d4: 1, north; 2, east; 3, south; 4, west).
>
> *Success:* The creature is immune to the Soporific Musk of all fiends for 10 minutes.
>
> ***Blurred Movement.*** Attack rolls against the fiend have disadvantage unless the the fiend's speed is 10 or lower or it is incapacitated.
>
> ***Evasion.*** When the fiend is subjected to an effect that allows a Dexterity saving throw to take half damage, it takes no damage on a successful save and half damage on a failed save.
>
> ***Springing Feet.*** The fiend ignores nonmagical difficult terrain and can stand up by spending 5 feet of movement, rather than half its speed.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The fiend makes three attacks: two with its claws and one with its sting.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) Slashing damage, and the target is Grappled (escape DC 16) by one of the fiend’s claws. The fiend can Grapple up to two creatures at a time.
>
> ***Sting.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) Piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 16.
>
> *Failure:* The creature is Drowsy*. The target can make a DC 16 Constitution save at the end of each of its turns. On a success, the effect ends. Alternatively, a creature can end the effect by using an action to empty a vial of holy water on the target.
>
> *Failure by 5+:* The creature falls Unconscious until the Drowsy effect ends.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
>
> ***Disruptive Song.*** The fiend sings a haunting melody. Any non-demon of excess creature within a 120-foot emanation originating from the fiend that can hear it has disadvantage on saving throws to maintain concentration until the start of the fiend’s next turn.
>
> **New condition described above*

### Fiend of Excess Loot
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. This could be done using an **Intelligence (Arcana)** or **Wisdom (Religion)** check.  

#### Fiend of Excess Loot Table
The following table describes the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.


##### Fiend of Excess Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
