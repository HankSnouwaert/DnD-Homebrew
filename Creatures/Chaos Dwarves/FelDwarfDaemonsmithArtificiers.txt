## Fel Dwarf Artificers


Among the merciless society of the Fel Dwarfs, infernal artificers exemplify the cruel ingenuity born from such a culture. Only the demonsmiths and sorcerer-prophets surpass them in crafting weapons of suffering. These hellish artisans are vital to the ceaseless creation of war machines that fuel the ambitious conquests of the Fel Dwarfs.

Although they do not wield brutal sorcery like their demonsmith masters, Fel Dwarf artificers possess extensive knowledge of the dark arts, alchemy, and metallurgy. They use this expertise to fabricate handheld versions of their unholy siege weapons—devices so cursed that only the artificers themselves can wield them. While it may seem that these contraptions are restricted to their creators to prevent their use against the Fel Dwarfs, the dark truth is far grimmer. During the forging process, a portion of the artificer’s soul is bound to the weapon, creating a dangerous connection. Even after the weapon's completion, its use erodes the wielder's soul and body, with prolonged exposure leading to horrific mutations or gradual petrification from within.


### Doomquake Battle Smith
The doomquake battle maul incorporates the devastating power of the doomquake mortar into a two-handed weapon. Artificers who wield these weapons in battle are a destructive force, capable of toppling stone walls with shockwaves that ripple out from every strike, pulverizing everything in their path. These weapons can also be slammed into the ground, causing the earth to buckle and shatter. Those unfortunate enough to stand on the unstable surface are swallowed by a churning sea of roiling earth.

### Magma Cannoneer
Using the same twisted alchemy as the magma cannon, magma spewers deliver gruesome deaths on the battlefield. These contraptions consist of a canister strapped to the artificer's back, constantly emitting black fumes and a sinister hissing sound. Tubes extend from the canister to a large nozzle, held by the artificer, which sprays molten metal capable of engulfing an entire regiment in seconds.

### Deathscreecher Artillerist
Deathscreecher artillerists bombard their enemies with blasphemous ammunition derived from deathscreecher rockets. These Fel Dwarfs load handheld mortars with demolition rockets capable of felling a hill giant on impact. Alternatively, they can choose the more wicked dreadfire rockets, which release a hord of burning souls. These spectral entities howl through the air, seeking out the nearest living beings to incinerate.



### Fel Dwarf Artificer Tactics

The following tips can help you run fel dwarf artificers in combat more effectively:

#### Doomquake Battle Smith
* Excels at disrupting melee combatants and pairs well with ranged allies.
* Uses Doomquake Slam to create difficult terrain:
    * Position the slam so enemies are near the far edge of the area as this hinders enemy movement toward the battle smith and allies.

#### Magma Spewer
* Targets tightly packed groups of enemies, especially those with low Dexterity.
* Performs exceptionally well in chokepoints:
    * Use Resolute Stance to hold the line effectively.

#### Deathscreecher Artillerist
* Seeks opportunities to:
    *  Target three or more enemies.
    *  Target at least two enemies with low Wisdom using the Frighten ability.
* Forces enemies within 60 feet of the cannon to flee.
    *  Be cautious not to let allies pursue fleeing enemies into danger.
*  Uses Demolition Rocket in situations where crowd control is not possible.

> ***Battle Ready.*** When the dwarf makes a weapon attack, it uses its Intelligence modifier instead of Strength or Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls.  
> 
> ***Debilitating Strikes.*** When the dwarf reduces a creature to 0 hit points with an attack, that creature is stunned for the next minute, even if it regains hit points.  
> 
> ***Dwarven Resilience.*** The dwarf has advantage on saving throws against poison.  
> 
> ***Resolute Stance.*** At the start of the dwarf's turn, it can focus entirely on standing its ground. Until the start of its next turn, any attack roll made against the dwarf has disadvantage. 
> 
> Additionally, the dwarf makes Strength (Athletics) checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.  The dwarf loses this benefit if it is moved against its will or knocked prone. If the dwarf uses this feature, its speed becomes 0 until the end of the current turn.  
> 
> ***Siege Monster.*** The dwarf deals double damage to objects and structures.  
> 
> ### Actions  
> 
> ***Multiattack.*** The dwarf makes two attacks.  
> 
> ***Doomquake Maul.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the target is a creature, it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of the dwarf's next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, it takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage, and the energy dissipates.  
> 
> ***Doomquake Slam (3/Day).*** The dwarf slams the ground with its Doomquake Maul, creating a 15-foot cube of burning earth originating from itself. Each creature in the cube must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, 9 (2d8) fire damage, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared and the area vibrates violently until the start of the dwarf's next turn. At that point, the vibrations end in a calamitous burst, and each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) thunder damage. On a success, it takes half damage.  


#### Doomquake Battle Smith Upgrade

The Doomquake Battle Smith can have any of the following upgrades. Its challenge rating (CR) increases by 1 for each upgrade it has.

##### Doomquake Battle Smith Upgrade
| d3  | Upgrade |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Deafening Thunder.***  Creatures sheathed in booming energy or standing in a vibrating area are deafened and cannot cast spells with a verbal component. A creature that fails a Constitution saving throw suffers these effects until the end of the dwarf’s next turn.

\columnbreak

|   |  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  2  | ***Shockwave.***  The area of the Doomquake Slam increases to a 60-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line originating from the dwarf.
|  3  | **Seismic Snare.** When a creature fails the Dexterity saving throw against the Doomquake Slam while standing on earth or stone, it becomes buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature is restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check. A creature making this check has advantage if it has a burrow speed.|

On a failed save, a creature takes 16 (3d10) fire damage and ignites. On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't ignited. An ignited creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until it uses an action to douse the flames.  



#### Magma Cannoneer Upgrade

The magma cannoneer can have any of the following upgrades. Its challenge rating (CR) increases by 1 for each upgrade it has.

##### Magma Cannoneer Upgrade
| d3  | Upgrade |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Caustic Tar.*** A creature ignited by the Magma Spray ability is also restrained. If a creature uses its action to douse the flames, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength check. On a failure, the flames are not extinguished.
|  2  | ***Pyretic Acid.***  The magma cannoneer now deals acid damage instead of fire damage. Whenever a creature takes acid damage from the magma cannoneer, any armor it is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.
|  3  | ***Stinking Sulfur.*** Each creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of an ignited creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its current turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature is dazed* and can’t cast spells other than cantrips.|

\columnbreak

#### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

The dwarf can’t use this attack again until it reloads the launcher as an action or by using its Resolute Stance feature (no action required).  
>
> ***Dread Fire Rocket (3/Day).*** The dwarf fires a cursed rocket from its launcher at a point of its choice within 120 feet but no less than 15 feet away. The rocket explodes, creating a 15-foot-radius sphere of burning souls. At the start of the dwarf's next turn, the sphere moves up to 30 feet toward the nearest creature before disappearing. 
>
> Any creature in the sphere when it appears or creature whose space the sphere moves into must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and is frightened until the end of the dwarf's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 9), it can't take reactions and must take the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the sphere by the safest available route.
