## Infernal Taurus
*Hellish Flying Bulls Formed From Elemental Fire*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Planar (Elemental Plane <br> of Fire), Volcanic; **Treasure:** None <br>
When the winds of pyromantic magic gather and <br> consolidate in an area, destruction soon follows. Fires <br> sweep across the land, leaving only ash and ruin in their wake. The earth trembles, and volcanoes erupt from its tortured crust. Amid such magically wrought calamities, the coalescing powers of pyromancy may give birth to a creature that embodies pure, unrelenting destruction: the Infernal Taurus.

These hellish bovines are stubborn and wrathful, their anger quick to ignite. When provoked, their rage becomes terrifying to behold. As hatred begins to burn within the creature, its charred hide radiates with such heat that iron and steel melt upon contact. It paws the ground with obsidian hooves, sending white-hot sparks flying and branding the land with scorched gouges. Tendrils of dark smoke pour from its flaring nostrils, and its eyes blaze like twin torches. With a beat of massive crimson wings, it streaks through the air like a blazing comet, its brimstone horns skewering and searing all in its path.

Fortunately, these fearsome incarnations wither and crumble to ash within days if deprived of the intense magical heat that birthed them. Thus, they can only endure in places of great fire—scorching deserts, volcanic wastes, or the Plane of Fire itself.

Yet the fel dwarves venerate these beasts for their rage, resilience, and capacity for wanton destruction. Their daemonsmiths construct vast ritual furnaces to sustain the infernal taurus, keeping them compliant and ready to be unleashed upon lush lands ripe for immolation.


Maintaining such brutal power is perilous. The fires that sustain a taurus must be constantly fed with incantations and blood sacrifices. Should the flame falter, the beast's wrath turns upon its keepers. Only the most ambitious and foolhardy warlords dare to make these monsters their mounts, nailing saddles of enchanted brass into their flesh to survive the heat. Such lords are spoken of with dread—for when one of these tyrants rises into the sky upon a blazing bull above the battlefield like a blazing sun, it is a harbinger of doom.

### Baleful Taurus

At the greatest confluence of pyromantic energies, an even more terrible creature is born—the Baleful Taurus. These monsters eclipse even the infernal taurus in their capacity to unleash burning calamity. With its sinewed limbs, it stamps the earth, sending waves of molten rock rippling outward. A single beat of its flame-wreathed wings summons gales of scorching ash that flay skin and blind the unprepared.

The most powerful overseers and daemonsmiths pay dearly in wealth and blood to bind such an embodiment of fire to their will.

### Infernal Taurus Tactics
Infernal taurus are most effective when charging between targets to maximize the use of their Gore and Stomp attacks. They are able to dive bomb targets this way from the sky as an opening move, choosing targets that rely on melee weapons as their preferred targets. Their Resolute feature provides significant benefits, so they will attempt to maintain it whenever possible—even if doing so means attacking suboptimal targets. 

#### Baleful Taurus Tactics
Baleful Taurus are more flexible in combat, able to forgo standard attacks in favor of the following abilities:

**Molten Smash.** This ability is always used if the Taurus can hit three or more targets, or if it failed to knock a creature prone this turn.

**Cinder Gale.** This is favored when there are no optimal targets to charge or if the Taurus is unable to move.

##### Infernal Taurus Adventure Hooks
| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Tyrant's Mount:** A fel dwarf champion is preparing for conquest astride an infernal taurus, but the saddle-ritual is incomplete. The party is hired to infiltrate the forges before the final binding is complete, to sabotage the process—or slay the beast before it becomes unstoppable.|
|  2  | **The Dying Furnace:** A ritual furnace that sustains an infernal taurus deep beneath a fel dwarf keep is beginning to fail. The beast grows more unstable by the hour, and the fortress risks complete incineration if it breaks free. A rebel faction within the keep hires the party to hasten the collapse as part of a wider revolt.  |
|  3  | **The Burning Tomb:** A forgotten tomb, once sealed with molten stone, now vents smoke and fire. An infernal taurus, imprisoned centuries ago by an ancient pyromancer order, has begun to stir. The party must discover the reason for its return—and determine if the creature is being awakened or escaping.|
|  4  |**The Baleful Bounty:** A powerful daemonsmith has promised a vast reward to any who help him trap a newly-manifested baleful taurus to serve as his personal siege mount. The party may be hired to assist—or recruited by a rival faction to ensure the beast is never controlled by anyone. |

### Infernal Taurus Loot
Valuable infernal taurus loot typically comes from harvested materials and usually requires a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a **Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools)** check to gather Hide). 

Alternatively, you can roll for loot randomly using a flat modifier.

##### Infernal Taurus Loot (Avg. 550gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 2d4(5) 50gp Items (250gp) |
|  10-13 | 1d6(3) 100gp Items (300gp) | 
|  14-20 | 2d4(5) 100gp Items (500gp) |  
|  21-25 | 1d6(3) 200gp Items (600gp)  |  
|  26+ |  2d6(7) 200gp Items (1,400gp) |  

##### Baleful Taurus Loot (Avg. 1,775gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-10  | 1 500gp Items (500gp) |
|  11-14 | 1 1,000gp Items (1,000gp) | 
|  15-21 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items (2,000gp) |  
|  22-25 | 1 2,000gp Items (2,000gp)  |  
|  26+ |  1d4(2) 2,000gp Items (4,000gp) |  

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 100gp Bone item from an infernal taurus could be a Taurus Horn, a 50gp version might be a Cracked Taurus Horn, and a 200gp version could be a Pristine Taurus Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.



##### Infernal Taurus Materials: 100gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Taurus Horn (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2   | Flesh | Taurus Heart (Damaged/Pristine)|  
| 3   | Fluid|  Taurus Blood (Clotted/Thick) |  
| 4  | Hide |Taurus Hide (Tattered/Tough) | 
 
\columnbreak 
 

##### Baleful Taurus Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|  Baleful Taurus Fang (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2   | Flesh | Baleful Taurus Heart (Damaged/Pristine)|  
| 3   | Fluid| Baleful Taurus Blood (Clotted/Thick) |  
| 4  | Hide | Baleful Taurus Skin (Tattered/Tough) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of infernal taurus, Fire effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that create light, conjure fire spells, or embolden allies.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

<br>



> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid. 
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.
