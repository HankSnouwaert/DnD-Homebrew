#### Razer Horns

*froged in the likness of a great bull, it's horns can shatter though mounts once it gains movement* 

When the destroyer makes a Slam attack, it deals extra 13 (2d12) piercing damage on hit for every 20 feet it moved straight toward the target before it hit. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 16), it can't stand up until the start of the destroyer's next turn.

#### Blazing Wings

*The K'daai Destroyer has had two great wings infused with sorcery attach to it's back, When the device lands upon the earth, it lets lose a shock wave of fire.*

The destroyer has a fly speed of 60.

Additionally, if the destroyer is flying and dives at least 20 feet in a straight line before landing on the ground, each other creature standing on the ground within 10 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. 

For each additional 20 feet the destroyer dove before landing, the area of the effect increases by 10 feet, and the damage increases by 9 (2d8).

#### Colossal Plating

*The K'daai Destroyer has two large black iron plates welded on ether side of it's body etched with unholy script, casing it to be near indestructible unless some how removed.*

The destroyer starts with two iron plates attached to it. For each plate attached, it gets +3 to all saving throws and its AC (+6 while both are attached). A creature within 5 feet of the destroyer can use its action to make a DC 21 Strength check to detach one of the plates. It may add its proficiency bonus if it is proficient with Smith's Tools. The creature takes 10(3d6) fire damage when it makes the check if the destroyer's Blazing Body trait is active.

#### Gore Blades

*The K'daai Destroyer body is covered in Blades, miss step from a nearby enemy can resulte in being shredded.*

The destroyer's Slam now deals 29 (6d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6) fire damage on hit.

When a creature misses with a melee attack against the destroyer while within 5 feet of it, attempts to grapple it, or starts its turn grappling it, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage. 

Additionally, when a creature moves into or within the area the destroyer is occupying, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.
