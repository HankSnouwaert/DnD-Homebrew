## Infernal Destroyer

These fiendish creations represent the pinnacle <br> of chaos dwarf craftsmanship and their ability to <br> bind demons within machines. Infernal destroyers are massive constructs that stand as titanic embodiments <br> of the chaos dwarves' irreverent audacity and relentless pursuit of power. Each Infernal Destroyer is unique, meticulously designed and crafted by the most skilled Chaos Dwarf engineers and infusors, reflecting the personality, preferences, and ambitions of its creator.

During their creation, a grand ritual of binding is undertaken, calling forth a powerful demon spirit from the chaotic abyss and entrapping it within the cold iron of the construct. This demonic essence provides the machine with a sinister semblance of life and fuels its formidable abilities. The metal of an infernal destroyer is superheated by the trapped spirit, causing it to glow with a fearsome, otherworldly light and scorch the earth it walks upon.

Infernal Destroyers can take a variety of forms, from hulking siege machines in the shape of bulls to monstrous constructs with draconic forms and flaming wings capable of decimating entire armies. The exact abilities of a destroyer vary with its form and purpose. Some might be fitted with massive armor, others might devastate their foes with an array of slashing blades across their body, and yet others may shatter foes with mighty charges and fiendish horns.

Despite their terrifying power, infernal destroyers are not without vulnerabilities. The fiery demon spirits that animate them are a volatile source of power, pushing the metal bodies of the constructs to their limits. If the destroyer has sustained heavy damage and continues to exert itself, the demonic energies within will begin tearing it apart and hindering its ability to operate. Should this process continue unchecked while the destroyer continues to fight, the volatile forces within will eventually destroy it from the inside out. 

Despite this weakness, infernal destroyers can typically win the day for their chaos dwarf masters before collapsing. Their masters then quickly recover their remains so they can be repaired and reanimated for their next rampage.

### Destroyer Enhancements
If you wish to create a more powerful version of the infernal destroyer, you can give it one of the following enhancements. Doing so increases its CR to 18.

#### Bovine Horns

*This destroyer has been forged in the likeness of a great bull, and if it picks up enough momentum, its horns can shatter mountains.*

When the destroyer makes a Slam attack, it deals extra 13 (2d12) piercing damage on hit for every 20 feet it moved straight toward the target before it hit. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 20 feet away and knocked prone. If it fails the save by 5 or more (DC 16), it can't stand up until the start of the destroyer's next turn.

#### Blazing Wings

*The destroyer has been equipped with flaming wings capable of unleashing waves of fire when it lands on the ground.*

The destroyer has a fly speed of 60.

Additionally, if the destroyer is flying and dives at least 20 feet in a straight line before landing on the ground, each other creature standing on the ground within 10 feet of it must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 9 (2d8) fire damage on a failed save and half as much damage on a successful one. 

For each additional 20 feet the destroyer dove before landing, the area of the effect increases by 10 feet, and the damage increases by 9 (2d8).

#### Colossal Plating

*The destroyer has been fitted with large black iron plates welded on either side of its body and etched with unholy runes, which render it nearly indestructible unless they can be removed.*

The destroyer starts with two iron plates attached to it. For each plate attached, it gets +3 to all saving throws and its AC (+6 while both are attached). A creature within 5 feet of the destroyer can use its action to make a DC 21 Strength check to detach one of the plates. It may add its proficiency bonus if it is proficient with Smith's Tools. The creature takes 10(3d6) fire damage when it makes the check if the destroyer's Blazing Body trait is active.

#### Gore Blades

*The destroyer’s body has been covered in razor-sharp blades capable of slicing apart any who draw near.*.

The destroyer's Slam now deals 29 (6d6 + 8) slashing damage plus 17 (5d6) fire damage on hit.

When a creature misses with a melee attack against the destroyer while within 5 feet of it, attempts to grapple it, or starts its turn grappling it, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage. 

Additionally, when a creature moves into or within the area the destroyer is occupying, the creature takes 10 (3d6) slashing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

### Infernal Destroyer Loot
Because infernal destroyers are constructs, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Infernal Destroyer Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Infernal Destroyer Tactics

Infernal destroyers are mindless monsters, driven solely by their destructive instincts, with little regard for their own survival. They never flee from a fight and will fight to the death. However, their creators can guide their actions and may direct them to execute more complex tactics. If these creators are killed or incapacitated, the destroyer will revert back to its base instincts.

Infernal destroyers serve as hard-hitting shock troopers. Because their Burning Bright feature causes them to become unstable over time and lose attacks as they take damage, their best defense is their offense, hitting with such force that opponents struggle to properly retaliate from the brutal attacks. 

When guided by a more intelligent mind, they may attempt to engage the largest group of enemies to set them ablaze with their Blazing Body feature, focusing all attacks on any targets they believe will resist being burned away by their aura. They may unleash a 'Burning Barrage' to target backline foes, especially those casting dangerous spells. 

Armies with one or more infernal destroyers will follow similar tactics, aiming to hit hard at the beginning of the fight to break their enemies, utilizing all available resources and their strongest spells early in combat before their destroyers run the risk of destabilizing.

Infernal destroyers can be equipped with one of four upgrades that slightly alter their tactics:
* **Brazen Wings:** Allows them to disrupt backline foes by flying past sturdy front liners and slamming into groups of ranged combatants and spellcasters.

* **Colossal Plating:** Turns them into juggernauts, helping them stay alive. Their dwarven allies will focus on impeding whoever is most likely to remove the plating.

* **Gore Blades:** Enables them to shred through swarms of melee enemies, staying in the front line and serving as a blockade to protect more vulnerable creatures fighting alongside the destroyer.

* **Razer Horns:** Enhances their ability to destroy single targets. Fragile damage dealers, such as lightly armored wizards, will be decimated if the destroyer reaches them, and the destroyer is not afraid to take opportunity attacks if it means getting a charge against its intended target.
