## Fel Dwarf Dreadnaughts
*Possessed Dwarves Entombed Within Iron War Suits*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>

Among the many unholy practices embedded in fel dwarf society, few are as perilous or profane as the binding and enslavement of demonic entities. Within blasphemous forges, forge-workers perform dread rites under the direction of demon-smiths—dark rituals that summon malevolent spirits from other worlds and bind them into metal, infusing weapons and war machines with diabolical power.

These procedures are extremely hazardous. The summoned fiends viciously resist their captors, struggling to break free and wreak vengeance on those who would subjugate them. When such incantations go awry, the demon may possess any flesh-and-blood participant in the summoning—even the demon-smith themselves. The possessed are plunged into agony and hatred, driven into berserk rages by the invading essence. They lash out at everything nearby, attempting to slaughter all within reach before being subdued or consumed by the torment wracking their bodies.

To salvage such disasters, demon-smiths act swiftly. The possessed victim is restrained and forcibly grafted into a hastily forged exoskeleton of iron. Enchantments are laid upon the frame to tether the struggling soul within and suppress the demon’s full control. But the dwarf is not freed from suffering. Instead, they are forever bound to their armor—a living furnace fueled by the demon trapped within their flesh, gnawing at the edges of their mind.

\columnbreak

<br>

These malformed fusions are known as Dreadnoughts—living engines of destruction. No longer truly dwarfs, they serve the demon-smiths without hesitation, living only to spread the agony they themselves endure. They lash out at any foolish enough to oppose the fel dwarf empire. Their forged forms can withstand immense punishment; only those cunning or fortunate enough to pierce the armor and strike the dwarf buried within can end their miserable existence.

### Molten Dreadnaughts
The torment endured by molten dreadnoughts is used to heat their blackened metal bodies until they burn red-hot, boiling the air around them and igniting any who draw their ire. Their metal gauntlets sear flesh on contact, and built-in tanks release torrents of boiling chemicals to unleash tides of searing death.

### Ebon Dreadnaughts
Clad in sleek black steel, ebon dreadnoughts are suffused with entities of malice that draw strength from the shadows. Used as assassins by the elite of fel dwarf society, they mold umbral spears from surrounding darkness, piercing foes with weapons that leave no visible mark but inflict unspeakable misery. Once the deed is done, they melt back into the gloom from whence they came.

### Tormentor Dreadnaughts
Dreadnoughts with demons of death bound within are horrific indeed. These entities devise macabre weapons that keep their adversaries barely alive, preserving the faintest glimmer of life so they can be dragged back to the demon-smiths and enslaved—forced to live out their existence in endless agony.

<br>

\columnbreak

### Earthbane Dreadnaughts

The most terrible of demons are trapped within Hulking Dreadnoughts—massive horrors of sinister power. These brutes are equipped with hellish drills and claws, each capable of tearing through granite and sundering fortifications.

To add to their lethality, their enormous claw can unlatch from their armored frames, springing forward on thick chains. Should a claw strike a solid target, it clamps shut with crushing force and is swiftly reeled back toward the hulking warrior.

The drill is an even greater instrument of devastation. By piercing it into the ground, an earthbane dreadnought sends shockwaves rippling through the earth, causing it to scream and shatter. The ground erupts skyward in violent upheaval, crashing down in a cataclysmic wave that buries and batters any caught within.

### Fel Dwarf Dreadnaught Tactics

All dreadnoughts rely heavily on maintaining their Resolute Stance to prevent enemies from gaining advantage and striking their weak points.

#### Molten Dreadnought Tactics

Molten dreadnoughts seek to ignite as many targets as possible during combat. They use Naphtha Spray whenever they can hit two or more enemies (or other molten dreadnoughts) simultaneously. If no enemies are within melee range, they will also use Naphtha Spray to maintain the benefits of their Resolute Stance.

#### Ebon Dreadnought Tactics

Ebon dreadnoughts strike from the shadows, targeting creatures that are already in darkness while keeping their distance. If surrounded by melee attackers, they will use Shadow Step to reposition themselves and regain the advantage.

#### Tormentor Dreadnought Tactics

Tormentor dreadnoughts excel as defenders, aiming to minimize enemy movement and incoming damage. They open combat by using Torturous Containment against the creature with the lowest physical stats and the most health. They then employ Umbreal Binding on two different targets to further restrict enemy movement.

#### Earthbane Dreadnought Tactics

Earthbane dreadnoughts focus on isolating and crushing weaker ranged attackers. They use Grip Claw to pull low-Strength ranged enemies into melee, then immediately strike with their Fel Drill. If the target remains grappled on the dreadnought’s next turn, it uses Crushing Vise followed by another attack with the Fel Drill.

If the Dreadnought fails to grapple a target, or if it can hit three or more enemies at once, it uses Upheaval instead of Fel Drill.

The Dreadnought uses Swat to push away frontline warriors who obstruct its path to priority targets.

### Fel Dwarf Dreadnaught Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from fel dwarf dreadnaughts come from what can be salvaged from their chassis. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Metal item from a dreadnaught could be Dreadnaught Scrap, a 50gp version might be a Worn Dreadnaught Scrap, and a 200gp version could be a Masterwork Dreadnaught Scrap.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.



##### Normal Dreadnaught Materials: 10gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Gem|   Ruby (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2-4   | Metal | Dreadnaught Scrap (Worn/Masterwork)|  

 

##### Earthbane Dreadnaught Materials: 100gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Gem|   Jet (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2-4   | Metal | Earthbane Dreadnaught Scrap (Worn/Masterwork)|

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The **Magic Theme** column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the **Example Descriptor** suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Fiendish magic item effects might drain the life of their victims or conjure unholy magic, while Shadow effects might create darkness or utilize necrotic magic. 

***Random Magic Ingredients.***
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Fel Dwarf Dreadnaught Magic Themes 
**Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot: 75%**
|1d4 | Magic Theme | Example Descriptor | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-2 <br>  | Fiendish| Demon-Touched| 
| 3-4 (Molten)  | Fire | Ever-Burning|  
| 3-4 (Ebon)  | Shadow  | Light-Devouring| 
| 3-4 (Tormentor)  | Fiendish  | Demon-Touched| 
| 3-4 (Earthbane)  | Earth  | Earthen| 

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

### New Condition: Resolute
The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
 * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
 * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
 * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
 
The condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.
 
### New Condition: Burning
The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished.
* **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
* **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
* **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

> ##### Notes on 2024 Burning Rules
> If you're using the rules for burning described in the 2024 edition of D&D, these are the changes that were made in this document:
> * **Sources of Burning Don't Stack.** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
> * **Damage At End of Turn.** Burning damage occurs at the end of a creature's turn rather than the beginning. This gives the creature the chance to try to end the condition before taking the damage, thus giving players more agency when they start burning.
