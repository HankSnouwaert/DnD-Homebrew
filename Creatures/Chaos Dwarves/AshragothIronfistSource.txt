## Ashragoth Ironfist

Among the daemonsmith-prophets, none have ascended the ruthless hierarchy of the Infernal Priesthood or mastered the blasphemous arts of fel engineering as completely as Ashragoth Ironfist. The oldest living daemonsmith-prophet, he has ruled for centuries, his influence stretching across the fel dwarf empire like an unbreakable chain. His mastery of dark sorcery, malignant machinery, and fanatical devotion to the god of fire have made him a figure of absolute authority. His word is law, his will shaping every aspect of the empire’s relentless expansion.

Yet, for all the power and infamy Ashragoth has amassed, it has come at a terrible cost. Like all daemonsmiths who wield fiendish sorcery, he suffers from the Curse of Stone, a relentless affliction that petrifies his body with each act of dark magic. His limbs have stiffened, his once-boundless arcane might slowly fading. But rather than submit to fate, Ashragoth has turned his suffering into fuel for his ambition. He refuses to be a relic of the past. He will not just endure—he will conquer time itself.

To stave off his encroaching paralysis, Ashragoth has constructed a mechanical exoskeleton, grafting iron prosthetics onto his failing body. Now, he towers over his kin, his metal legs granting him inhuman mobility as he crushes those who dare oppose him beneath his ironbound feet. His mechanical arms, weapons of infernal design, enhance his lethality—one spews torrents of magical flame, turning all in its path to cinders, while the other wields a black-forged hammer burning with eternal heat, capable of melting through armor and shattering steel in a single blow. Even in his weakened state, his command of destructive sorcery remains terrifying, and entire settlements have been reduced to ash in mere minutes by the sorcery he commands.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Now, Ashragoth moves the fel dwarf empire toward its most ambitious conquest yet. Raiding parties surge beyond the empire’s borders, bolstered by unholy warriors and infernal war engines. Cities fall beneath relentless sieges, their populations dragged away in droves to an unknown fate. Meanwhile, his most trusted agents—champions, enslaved monstrosities, and daemon-forged abominations—scour forgotten tombs and holy sites, seizing long-lost relics to fuel Ashragoth’s ultimate plan.

Back in the heartland of the fel dwarves, an industrial hellscape churns at an unfathomable pace. Mines are stripped bare, heedless of the countless lives spent in the process. Towering factories vomit thick, black smoke into a sky long bereft of sunlight, their forges never ceasing as they churn out esoteric devices of eldritch power. At the center of this chaos looms the Grand Black Tower, Ashragoth’s unholy citadel. Its presence grows stronger with each passing day, spreading a malignant aura across the land like an infection. The very earth quakes beneath it, magma seeping from widening fissures as nameless horrors claw their way from the abyss. It is as if the world itself protests the atrocities being wrought.

Yet, the true purpose of Ashragoth’s great industry remains shrouded in mystery. The few who have escaped his empire speak in hushed whispers of a monolithic device, a creation so blasphemous that all past infernal constructs pale in comparison. What Ashragoth intends to do with this unfathomable machine remains unknown. But one thing is certain—his ambition does not end with regaining his former power, nor even with complete dominion over the fel dwarf Empire. His gaze is fixed on something far greater.

### Ashragoth's Lair
Ashragoth makes his lair in an obsidian tower located within a volcanic wasteland. Within the ziggurat, countless forges and altars are dedicated to the dark gods. The petrified bodies of former pupils and rivals of Ashragoth are embedded within the ramparts of the structure, At the heart of the temple lies Ashragoth’s personal laboratory, where he conducts his own dark experiments.

#### Lair Actions
When fighting within his lair, Ashragoth's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 2.

When Ashragoth rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or the Ashragoth dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 20 and can act of its own accord, always acting in Ashragoth’s best interest. While active in this way, the lair is aware of the location of all creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair can cause one of the following effects. It cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row:


**Seismic Tremors.** The lair chooses a 15-foot cube within itself, causing the ground in that area to violently shake. Each creature in the cube must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone. If a creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 13), it cannot stand up until initiative count 20 of the next round. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared, and the tremors persist until initiative count 20 of the next round. At that point, the vibrations culminate in a calamitous burst, forcing all creatures in the area to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6) thunder damage. On a success, it takes half damage.

**Burning Souls.** The lair conjures a 10-foot-radius sphere of burning souls at a point within itself. On initiative count 20 of the next round, the sphere moves up to 30 feet toward the nearest creature before disappearing. Any creature in the sphere when it appears or that the sphere moves into must make a DC 18 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10 (3d6) fire damage and is frightened until initiative count 20 of the next round. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is not frightened. If the creature fails the save by 5 or more (DC 13), it cannot take reactions and must use the Dash action on each of its turns to move away from the sphere by the safest available route.

#### Regional Effects
The area where Ashragoth dwells is corrupted by his presence, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of his lair:
* While in his lair, Ashragoth knows the location of any petrified creatures. As an action, he can choose a petrified creature within this region. For as long as he maintains concentration, he can perceive and speak through the creature.
* Whenever a creature fails to pick a lock, the tools it was using are destroyed, and the creature takes 17 (5d6) fire damage.
* Fires cannot be extinguished except by magical means or by being doused in blood.
* Small earthquakes are common.
* Water sources within 5 miles of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted with sulfur.
* Storms of hot ash are frequent.

These effects gradually dissipate over 1d10 days after Ashragoth's death.


##### Ashragoth Ironfist Adventure Hooks

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Stolen Furnace:** A massive war machine meant for Ashragoth’s personal use has been stolen by a rogue fel dwarf warband. With both sides hunting them, the party is caught in a deadly conflict over a weapon that could change the course of an impending war.|
|  2  |**The Suspicious Defector:** A high-ranking fel dwarf engineer claims to have grown disillusioned with Ashragoth’s rule and offers to betray his master, promising blueprints to the Grand Black Tower’s infernal war machines. But is this an act of rebellion or a ploy by Ashragoth to lure his enemies into a deadly trap? |
|  3  | **The Devil’s Bargain:** Whispers tell of Ashragoth forging a dark pact with an ancient fiend to stave off his petrification. The devil now demands a price even Ashragoth refuses to pay. The fiend offers the party a chance to strike down the daemonsmith while he is vulnerable—but the cost of aiding such an entity may be even steeper.   |
|  4  | **Doom of the Mountains:** Ashragoth has ordered an entire mountain range mined out to fuel his empire’s endless war machines. The land itself rebels, earthquakes tearing through the region as something ancient stirs beneath. The party is hired to investigate before the fel -Dwarves unearth something that should have remained buried.  |

### Epic Battle: Prophet of Flame
If you wish to turn the Ashragoth Ironfist into an endgame threat, make the following changes to his stats:

* Increase his Hit Points to 620.
* Change his Consuming Sorcery feature to require 5 levels of petrification before one of his limbs becomes petrified.
* Give him the Dark Father's Power feature descibed below
* Increase his Challenge Rating (CR) to 19.

***Dark Father's Power.*** Once per day, Ashragoth may cast the *eruption** (described at the end of the document) using his spellcasting ability if he has two or more petrified limbs.



### Ashragoth Ironfist Tactics
Ashragoth's durability is immense, and he generally does not concern himself with taking damage unless it triggers his Consuming Sorcery ability. He only uses Iron Will if he is incapacitated or takes more than 60 damage on a failed save.

Ashragoth can take four actions per turn, which are divided as follows:



#### Limb Actions
* **Hammer Arm.** Prioritizes targets resistant to fire damage.
* **Scorcher Arm.** Aims for the most targets possible, prioritizing enemies with low Dexterity.
* **Piston Legs.** Used to reposition himself. He will seek to land near vulnerable targets such as spellcasters with low Strength. However, if he is close to petrification or low on health, he will use this to jump to safety instead.

\columnbreak

#### Spellcasting
Ashragoth uses his turn to cast spells. As more of his limbs petrify, he gains the ability to concentrate on multiple spells at once. He will attempt to maintain as many different spells as possible, casting them in the following priority order (1 being the highest, 6 the lowest):

**1. Divine Hammer** – Used if it can hit three or more targets. Ashragoth will position the hammer where the most vulnerable targets (those likely to fail their saves) will be directly underneath.

**2. Burning Head** – Placed between himself and enemies to prevent them from spreading out and avoiding his other spells.

**3. Ash Storm** – Used when he can hit at least three targets, or two targets with low Constitution.

**4. Wall of Fire** – Should divide the battlefield roughly in half while hitting at least two targets. Ashragoth can jump over the wall using Iron Cascade, forcing enemies to move through it to reach him.

**5. Conflagration** – Targets a creature with low Dexterity that is at least 30 feet away from any allies.

**6. Magmatic Stone** – Used when he can hit three or more targets, or at least two targets with low Dexterity.

#### Lair Actions

&emsp;**Seismic Tremors:** Use this ability to force opponents out of fortified positions and into unfavorable terrain, such as lava storms created by *magmatic stone* or the fire created by *wall of fire*.

**Burning Souls:** Target the players farthest from Ashragoth to pressure them into moving closer to him. Position the sphere to ensure they move toward Ashragoth, increasing the likelihood that they're forced into his reach.

### Ashragoth Ironfist Loot
Because fel dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.



#### Ashragoth Ironfist Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

If you're running the epic Prophet of Flame version of Ashragoth, use the Prophet of Flame Loot Table to determine the additional valuables the players are able to loot.


##### Ashragoth Ironfist Loot Table

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |

|  20-24 | 1d6(3) 2,000gp Items |

### New Spells

#### Ash Storm

*5th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of soot)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Druid, Sorcerer, Wizard

You unleash a wave of scalding ash in a 60-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line originating from you in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 fire damage, is pushed 15 feet away form you, and is blinded until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the fire damage increases by 1d10 and for each slot level above 4th.

#### Burning Head
*5th-level conjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard

A 5-foot-diameter flaming head appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts for the duration. When the head appears, it lets out a terrifying screech. Creatures of your choice that can see and hear the head within 100 feet of it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the head until the spell ends. If a frightened creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to the head, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Contact With The Head.** Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the head must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 3d8 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

**Moving The Head.** As a bonus action, you can move the head up to 30 feet. If you ram the head into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the head’s damage, and the head stops moving this turn. When you move the head, you can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The head ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.

\columnbreak

#### Divine Hammer
*6th-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Cleric

Choose a point you can see on the ground within range and a direction. A giant hammer manifests and slams the ground at the chosen point, impacting everything in a 10-foot cube centered on the point. It then sends a 30-foot-long, 10-foot-wide shockwave in the chosen direction before disappearing.

Each creature in the area of the hammer’s impact or shockwave must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 fire or lighting damage (your choice) and 5d6 thunder damage and is knocked prone; it is also dazed* until the end of its next turn if it is in the area of the impact. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone or dazed.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the fire or lighting damage and the thunder damage each increase by 1d6 for every slot level above 6th.

#### Magmatic Stone
*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 100 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bit of igneous rock)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard

You conjure a molten rock and hurl it at a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage. Whether the attack hits or misses, the rock explodes on impact, creating a 15-foot-radius sphere of whirling magma centered on the point of impact. The sphere lasts for the duration, and its area is lightly obscured and considered difficult terrain. The sphere spreads around corners and seeps through openings at least 5 feet in diameter.

When the sphere first appears, and at the start of each of your turns thereafter, it moves 10 feet in the direction you hurled it from. Any creature whose space the sphere enters or passes through must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the bludgeoning and fire damage both increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.

<br>

### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
