## Fel Dwarf Daemonsmiths

In the cruel nations of the fel dwarves, no position commands more influence, power, and reverence than that of the daemonsmith. These dark artisans are few in number, for only those who master fiendish sorcery, science, and earn the favor of the dark gods can attain such authority. The path to becoming a daemonsmith is as brutal as it is unforgiving. Ambitious apprentices subject themselves to the tutelage of a master, seeking to learn blasphemous knowledge. Most are deemed unworthy, and of those accepted, few survive the trials of apprenticeship. Many fall victim to their master’s wrath or the inherent hazards of their craft.

Even once an apprentice rises to the rank of daemonsmith, their position is far from secure. The hierarchy of daemonsmiths is a fractious one, with no singular leader. Each daemonsmith rules their own domain of servants and slaves, consolidating power through conquest, unholy pacts, or fealty to other daemonsmiths and fiendish entities. Yet, despite their pitiless nature, daemonsmiths revere the eldest among them—those who have survived for millennia and earned the title of daemonsmith-prophets. These ancient beings act as direct conduits to the dark gods and wield unparalleled sway within the priesthood's fractured hierarchy.

However, no amount of prestige can save a daemonsmith-prophet or daemonsmith who begins to show weakness. Products of such a ruthless system are terrifying indeed. They form the ruling class of the fel Dwarf empires, dominating every aspect of society.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Industry, war, law, and religion all fall under their iron grip. Through merciless ingenuity and singular authority, the fel dwarves have spread their empire unchallenged, constructing towering black fortresses of dark iron, inventing unholy siege engines, and crafting firearms imbued with fiendish power. Their insatiable thirst for dominance knows no moral restraint, as they enslave countless souls to toil in perilous mines or be sacrificed in malevolent rituals.

***On the Battlefield.*** The cunning intellect of the fel dwarves is no less formidable on the battlefield. They call upon terrifying magic to crack and scorch the earth, inspire unfathomable hatred in their allies, and sap the spirit of enemy forces, turning them into listless subordinates. Their mastery of machinery allows them to wield weapons of war with lethal precision, enhancing their destructive capabilities through potent sorcery.

Each daemonsmith arms themselves with the pinnacle of demonic engineering: blood-forged axes, black powder rifles infused with their very souls, and vials of molten liquid that can dissolve metal on contact. However, this immense power comes at a terrible cost. The dark magics they wield are dangerously unwieldy, and any lapse in control can result in a backlash of malignant energy that begins to petrify their bodies. Over time, repeated failures can turn a daemonsmith into a black granite statue, an eternal monument to their hubris.

##### Dark Forged Weapons

Daemonsmiths are masters of constructing hellish weapons. You may choose one of the following properties for each of the dwarf's weapons. (It has Dweomer Leach on its battle axe and Possessed on its pistol by default.)

##### Daemonsmith Weapon effects
| d6  | effect |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Dweomer Leach.*** Creatures making Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell as a result of damage from this weapon have disadvantage on the saving throw. If a creature fails the save, the dwarf regains 5 hit points per level of the spell. |
|  2  | ***Fel Flare.***  The weapon deals an additional 7 (2d6) fire damage on a hit. Additionally, the target loses resistance to fire damage until the end of the dwarf’s next turn. |
|  3  | ***Life Bane.*** On a hit, the weapon curses the target. At the end of each of the cursed creature’s turns, it takes 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The curse ends if the creature ends its turn more than 60 feet away from the dwarf, if the dwarf dies, or if the cursed creature regains 10 or more hit points. |
| 4 | ***Malignant.*** When the dwarf makes an attack against a creature, it can choose to become obsessed* with that creature until the end of its next turn. If it does, the attack deals an additional 10 (3d6) fire damage on a hit. |
|  5  | ***Possessed.*** The weapon deals additional 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on hit, if the dwarf misses or deals no damage on hit, it takes 7 necrotic damage as the weapon hungers for blood.
|  6  | ***Spell-Wrought.*** When the dwarf hits a creature with the weapon, it can channel magic into the attack, dealing an additional 14 (4d6) force damage. If it does, the dwarf has disadvantage on saving throws made to maintain concentration on its Curse of Stone ability until the end of its next turn. |

##### Fel Dwarf Infantry Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Stolen Blueprint.** A young but ambitious fel dwarf daemonsmith has secretly constructed a siege weapon of devastating power—an experimental magma cannon capable of incinerating entire cities. However, the blueprints for the weapon have been stolen by a rival daemonsmith who plans to use them to gain favor with the dark gods. The party is hired—either by the desperate original creator or by one of the faction leaders fearful of this weapon—to infiltrate the rival's stronghold and retrieve or destroy the plans before they are put into production.|
|  2  |**The Petrified Prophet.** A daemonsmith-prophet of immense power has mysteriously succumbed to their final petrification, leaving behind a fortress filled with their unfinished creations, unstable experiments, and enslaved workers. The party is sent to investigate the fortress—either to claim the daemonsmith’s secrets, destroy the dangerous machinery left behind, or rescue survivors. However, the daemonsmith's spirit lingers in the cursed halls, manifesting through their machinery in an attempt to complete their work from beyond death.  |
|  3  | **The Master’s Wrath.** A fel dwarf daemonsmith's apprentice has fled their master’s forge, stealing a powerful artifact in the process. The master has sent mercenaries to recover the artifact and punish the apprentice, but the apprentice seeks refuge with the party or a nearby settlement, offering to share the artifact’s secrets in exchange for protection.   |
|  4  |**War of the Daemonsmiths.** Two rival daemonsmiths are locked in a deadly feud over resources, territory, and the favor of the dark gods. Each has fortified their strongholds with armies, war machines, and fiendish traps, and their conflict is devastating the surrounding lands. The party is caught in the middle of this brutal war and must navigate the conflict, choosing whether to align with one side, manipulate both for their own ends, or find a way to eliminate both daemonsmiths and their war machines.   |
|  5  |**The Breaking of the Chains.** A faction of slaves, including a number of brilliant but oppressed craftsmen, has revolted against their daemonsmith overlord and seized one of their war machines—a massive Iron Demon. The slaves seek to turn the machine against their oppressors, but the daemonsmith has sent their forces, including other war machines, to crush the rebellion.  |
|  6  |  **The Forgotten Outpost.** The players have been hired to explore and loot an abandoned fel dwarf outpost in the frozen north by one of its former guards. While looting the rusted remains and demonically possessed machinery, they encounter a daemonsmith and his retinue who've come to do some off-the-books looting of their own. |

> On a failed save, the dwarf gains a level of petrification. For each level of petrification it has, its speed is reduced by 5 feet, and its AC increases by 1.

Until the start of its next turn, any attack roll made against the dwarf has disadvantage.

The dwarf loses this benefit if an effect moves it against its will or knocks it prone. If the dwarf uses this feature, its speed becomes 0 until the end of the current turn.

> 
> ***Life Bane Pistol.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, range 30/90 ft., one target. *Hit:* 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage on hit. If the dwarf misses or deals no damage on hit, it takes 7 necrotic damage as the weapon hungers for blood. If the dwarf made a ranged attack, it can’t do so again with this weapon until it loads it as an action or in place of an attack that’s part of an attack action. It can also load it when it uses its Resolute Stance feature (no action required). 
> 
> ***Infuse Weapon.*** The dwarf touches a willing construct, vehicle, or siege weapon and expends a spell slot. The target regains 32 (5d10 + 5) hit points, has advantage on its attack rolls, and imposes disadvantage on any saving throws forced by its effects until the end of its next turn.

- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 4d6 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The radius of the fog increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2.

#### Shroud of Dusk

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, M (A drop of pitch or piece of coal)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You release a surge of chilling shadows in a 20-foot-long, 10-foot-wide line that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 1d10 cold damage, and on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

The line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 10 for each slot level above 1.

#### Withering Resolve
*3rd-level enchantment*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Bard
___

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil. On a failed save, for the duration of the spell, the target has disadvantage on all checks and saving throws not triggered by this spell, and attack rolls against it have advantage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3.

### New Lore of Metal Spells

#### Plague of Rust

*3rd-level transmutation*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of gold thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

#### Searing Shard

*1st -level conjuration*

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 ft
- **Components:** S, M (A small piece of sliver)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Artificer

You send a sizzling jagged silver shard from your fingertips flying at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 piercing damage, and the shard embeds in the creature. At the end of the creature's next turn, it takes 2d10 fire damage if the shard is still embedded.

**Removing The Shard.** A creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the shard. On a success, the shard is removed, and on a failure, the shard is still removed, but the creature takes 2d4 slashing damage.

***At Higher Levels.***  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the piercing and slashing damage each increase by 1d4, and the fire damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

### Fel Dwarf Spell Casters Tactics

Fel dwarf spell casters adopt a resolute stance to establish a defensive position, often alongside other ranged attackers or siege weapons. They excel at lobbing spells and using either their pistols or infusing siege weapons. These spell casters do not retreat when engaged in melee combat unless they are overwhelmed, as their low speed and resolute stance improve survivability in close encounters.

#### Fel Dwarf Weapons
Fel dwarf weapons vary in effectiveness based on their type and the situation. The targeting strategy for each weapon is as follows:

**Dweomer Leech** – Targets enemy spell casters concentrating on spells.

**Fel Flare** – Prioritizes creatures with fire resistance.

**Life Ban** – Focuses on hitting as many distinct targets as possible.

**Malignant** – Best used against enemies attempting to engage the dwarf in melee combat.

**Possessed** – Targets the creature with the lowest AC in the group.

**Spell-Wrought** – Used whenever the dwarf has its resolute stance active to give it advantage on saving throws, canceling out the disadvantage from the weapon.

#### Lords of Magic

Fel dwarfs are intelligent and innately understand which spells to cast based on the situation. Spells are prioritized numerically, with 1 being the highest priority.

##### Lore of Death

&emsp; **Life Leech** – Works well with disposable minions, as they can be caught in the area of an AOE spell, enhancing spell effectiveness even if all enemies pass.

**Horrifying Laughter** – Cast on targets with low Wisdom saves, prioritizing the closest one.

**Wind of Death** – Used when it can hit two or more targets or a single target with a low Constitution save.

**Impending Doom** – Targets creatures benefiting from advantage (e.g., Barbarians with Reckless Attack or Rogues with Sneak Attack).

**Aspect of Dread** – Cast when it can frighten three or more targets, prioritizing clustered enemies.

**Crippling Pain** – Used on high-mobility skirmishers such as Monks or Rogues.

**Spirit Leech** – Cast on creatures with low Charisma.

##### Lore of Fel Dwarves

&emsp;**Malevolent Power** – If the dwarf is making four or more saving throws in a round or is one failure away from turning to stone, it drops concentration on its second spell.

**Divine Hammer** – Targets three or more creatures or two in the area where the hammer hits.

**Ash Storm** – Hits three or more targets or those with low Constitution saves.

**Curse of Stone** – Cast on targets with high health and low Constitution.

**Magmatic Stone** – Creates chokepoints or hits three or more enemies.

**Breath of Hatred** – Used to force enemies to focus on unfavorable targets, grant allies advantage, or keep an enemy from fleeing.

**Subjugate** – Targets martial classes directly threatening the dwarf.

##### Lore of Fire

&emsp;**Kindleflame** – The dwarf prioritizes spells against targets with burns.

**Burning Head** – Creates fear in enemies, putting the head between it and its enemies. The bonus action is used to slam the head into a target with burns.

**Burning Bolts** – Targets three or more enemies or two enemies with burns and low Dexterity.

**Wall of Fire** – Blocks enemy movement or hits three or more targets if it has already used Fireball.

**Fireball** – Targets three or more creatures or two with burns/low Dexterity.

**Scorching Ray** – All attacks should be stacked against one creature, as each bolt will apply a burn to the target. This is good for attempting to break concentration on an enemy spellcaster. For Sorcerer-Prophets, this becomes a priority if there is a target with three or more burns; the spell should be upcast to 3rd level.

**Hellish Rebuke** – Reserved for burned targets likely to hit the dwarf.

##### Lore of Shadow

&emsp;**Shadow Paths** – Enables the dwarf to swap positions with allies without breaking its stance, improving survivability.

**Pit of Shadows** – Targets three enemies or two with low Dexterity saves.

**Withering Resolve** – Cast on low Wisdom targets while maintaining concentration.

**Mindrazors** – Used when two or fewer creatures are trapped by Pit of Shadows.

**Penumbral Pendulum** – Targets enemies with low Dexterity and Intelligence or those affected by Withering Resolve.

**Mystifying Miasma** – Effective in chokepoints, hitting multiple enemies.

**Shroud of Dusk** – Cast when it benefits allies but used cautiously to avoid obstructing visibility.

##### Lore of Metal

&emsp;**Metalshifting** – Targets creatures in heavy armor or carrying powerful weapons.

**Blade Barrier** – Placed strategically to hit multiple enemies or block movement.

**Molten Silver** – Focuses on heavily armored enemies with low Dexterity.

**Vitriolic Sphere** – Hits groups or armored foes.

**Plague of Rust** – Weakens enemy armor. If the enemies have a powerful magic weapon such as a +2 weapon, it will target a weapon instead. If there are two or more such weapons being carried by the enemies, it will upcast the spell, making it a priority over 

**Cloud of Daggers** – Effective in narrow chokepoints or against clustered enemies.

### Fel Dwarf Daemonsmith Loot
Because fel dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Fel Dwarf Daemonsmith Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll.
