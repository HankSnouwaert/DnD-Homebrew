## Doom Cannons
A terrifying fusion of demon and war machine, the doom cannon stands as the pinnacle of fel dwarf siegecraft. This nightmarish engine is created by binding the soul of a powerful demon into brass and iron. The imprisoned spirit grants the cannon a horrifying semblance of life—groaning and shaking with unearthly hatred, yearning only for destruction.

These cursed weapons are overseen by sadistic engineers, typically fel dwarfs, who do not merely crew the doom cannon but rather guide it as one would a rabid beast. They feed the war machine freshly slain bodies, shoveling corpses into its rear chamber. Within the infernal mechanism, flesh and bone are swiftly liquefied, their souls extracted to fuel its chaotic flames. These unnatural fires erupt from the cannon’s maw,  scorching the battlefield and warping anything unfortunate enough to be caught in their wake.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br>

Among the deadliest instruments in the fel dwarfs’ arsenal, doom cannons are often sold to unholy warbands in exchange for vast hoards of slaves or plundered wealth. Tribes of fiend-worshipping marauders and orders of dark knights frequently employ them as artillery in their accursed crusades. However, those who wield these monstrous weapons must eventually pay the true price of their power.

Even with experienced handlers, the safeguards meant to contain the demon within inevitably fail. Many doom cannons have surged forward into enemy lines, abandoning their handlers in fits of uncontrollable bloodlust. At other times, the chaotic energies within grow unstable, causing deadly magical disruptions or leading to catastrophic explosions that consume all nearby—friend and foe alike. Some turn upon their own masters, scarring their minds with unspeakable horrors—or worse, drag them screaming into their fiery cores, where their souls remain trapped within the infernal machine.

#### Ice-Forged Doom Cannon
In the cursed, frostbitten lands where malevolent forces hold sway, the fel dwarfs devised a chilling variant of the doom cannon: the ice-forged doom cannon. Unlike its fiery counterpart, this dreadful siege engine is crafted by subjugating the living nightmares that haunt the frozen wastes.

When fed a corpse, the engine grinds the body into crimson ice shards, transmuting the remains into its deadly ammunition.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

It then unleashes them in a merciless barrage of unholy frost. This accursed ammunition mercilessly drains the warmth and vitality from its victims, leaving only frozen husks behind.

Many savage barbarian tribes dwelling in these forsaken lands pay exorbitant sums to acquire such weapons, and survivors of an ice-forged doom cannon’s onslaught often find themselves swiftly overwhelmed by zealots of the dark gods.

This damage ignores cold resistance. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it suffers a level of exhaustion. A creature in the area of more than one chilling ice burst is affected only once.

#### Doom Cannon of Damnation
The doom cannon of damnation is an even more powerful iteration of the doom cannon—an exceedingly rare and perilous creation, requiring the greatest mastery of dark artificers. Unlike its predecessors, this monstrous weapon does not merely rain fire or ice upon its enemies; instead, it unleashes torrents of soul-rending energy.

Those caught in its malignant blasts have their very essence wrenched from their bodies, their souls drawn into the cannon to fuel its devastating black magic. A single doom cannon of damnation can reap the souls of entire armies, trapping them within its iron frame to perpetuate its insatiable hunger.

\columnbreak

<br>

Yet, for all its devastating power, even the most ruthless warlords hesitate to wield such a weapon. Should the demon within ever break free, the consequences would be catastrophic. There are whispers of a battle where one such cannon escaped its handlers' control, feasting indiscriminately upon all combatants. When the dust settled, nothing remained of the armies that had clashed—only the doom cannon of damnation itself, rolling onward across the land, with the souls of every fallen warrior stowed within its depths.

### Doom Cannon Mishap Table

| d6  | Mishap Name         | Mishap Effect |
|:----:|:------------------|:--------------|
| **1**  | Demonic Rush | The cannon must move toward the closest non-bound creature it can see and then use its action to make a slam attack against it if the creature is within range. If the creature is not within range, it takes the Dash action to move closer to the target. |
| **2**  | Fel Feedback | The cannon's energies backlash, disrupting the winds of magic. Until the end of its next turn, the cannon cannot use its Fire! ability, and any creature that attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher within 300 feet of the cannon must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) force damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted. |
| **3**  | Vengeful Rampage | The cannon lashes out, using its action to make a slam attack against each creature within 5 feet. |
| **4**  | Pulse of Terror | The cannon's demonic essence instills terror in those around it. Each creature bound to the cannon within 30 feet becomes frightened of it until the end of the cannon's next turn. While frightened, affected creatures cannot take reactions and must use the Dash action on their turn, moving away from the cannon by the safest available route. |
| **5**  | Unstable Blast | The cannon's speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn. Its Fire! ability recharges and must be used this turn. All creatures targeted by the blast have disadvantage on the saving throw. |
| **6**  | Free at Last! | The cannon explodes, destroying itself. Each creature within 30 feet suffers the effects of its Fire! ability as if they were in its blast radius and have disadvantage on the saving throw. |

### Doom Cannon Tactics
Doom cannons are usually operated by Fel Dwarf engineers who keep them supplied with corpses. When well-fed, they stay back and bombard enemies from a distance.

If they run out of bodies, their handlers let them charge into enemy lines to refuel. When left on their own, doom cannons have no tactics, only an uncontrollable urge to destroy.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
