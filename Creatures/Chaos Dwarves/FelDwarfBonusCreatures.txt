# Bonus Fel Dwarf Creatures

## Fel Dwarf Artificers


Among the merciless society of the Fel Dwarfs, infernal artificers exemplify the cruel ingenuity born from such a culture. Only the demonsmiths and sorcerer-prophets surpass them in crafting weapons of suffering. These hellish artisans are vital to the ceaseless creation of war machines that fuel the ambitious conquests of the Fel Dwarfs.

Although they do not wield brutal sorcery like their demonsmith masters, Fel Dwarf artificers possess extensive knowledge of the dark arts, alchemy, and metallurgy. They use this expertise to fabricate handheld versions of their unholy siege weapons—devices so cursed that only the artificers themselves can wield them. While it may seem that these contraptions are restricted to their creators to prevent their use against the Fel Dwarfs, the dark truth is far grimmer. During the forging process, a portion of the artificer’s soul is bound to the weapon, creating a dangerous connection. Even after the weapon's completion, its use erodes the wielder's soul and body, with prolonged exposure leading to horrific mutations or gradual petrification from within.


### Doomquake Battle Smith
The doomquake battle maul incorporates the devastating power of the doomquake mortar into a two-handed weapon. Artificers who wield these weapons in battle are a destructive force, capable of toppling stone walls with shockwaves that ripple out from every strike, pulverizing everything in their path. These weapons can also be slammed into the ground, causing the earth to buckle and shatter. Those unfortunate enough to stand on the unstable surface are swallowed by a churning sea of roiling earth.

### Magma Cannoneer
Using the same twisted alchemy as the magma cannon, magma spewers deliver gruesome deaths on the battlefield. These contraptions consist of a canister strapped to the artificer's back, constantly emitting black fumes and a sinister hissing sound. Tubes extend from the canister to a large nozzle, held by the artificer, which sprays molten metal capable of engulfing an entire regiment in seconds.

### Deathscreecher Artillerist
Deathscreecher artillerists bombard their enemies with blasphemous ammunition derived from deathscreecher rockets. These Fel Dwarfs load handheld mortars with demolition rockets capable of felling a hill giant on impact. Alternatively, they can choose the more wicked dreadfire rockets, which release a hord of burning souls. These spectral entities howl through the air, seeking out the nearest living beings to incinerate.



### Fel Dwarf Artificer Tactics

The following tips can help you run fel dwarf artificers in combat more effectively:

#### Doomquake Battle Smith
* Excels at disrupting melee combatants and pairs well with ranged allies.
* Uses Doomquake Slam to create difficult terrain:
    * Position the slam so enemies are near the far edge of the area as this hinders enemy movement toward the battle smith and allies.

#### Magma Spewer
* Targets tightly packed groups of enemies, especially those with low Dexterity.
* Performs exceptionally well in chokepoints:
    * Use Resolute Stance to hold the line effectively.

#### Deathscreecher Artillerist
* Seeks opportunities to:
    *  Target three or more enemies.
    *  Target at least two enemies with low Wisdom using the Frighten ability.
* Forces enemies within 60 feet of the cannon to flee.
    *  Be cautious not to let allies pursue fleeing enemies into danger.
*  Uses Demolition Rocket in situations where crowd control is not possible.

If the target is a creature, it becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of the dwarf's next turn. If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then, it takes 9 (2d8) thunder damage, and the energy dissipates.  
> 
> ***Doomquake Slam (3/Day).*** The dwarf slams the ground with its Doomquake Maul, creating a 15-foot cube of burning earth originating from itself. Each creature in the cube must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, 9 (2d8) fire damage, and is knocked prone. On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't knocked prone. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain until cleared and the area vibrates violently until the start of the dwarf's next turn. At that point, the vibrations end in a calamitous burst, and each creature in the area must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 14 (4d6) thunder damage. On a success, it takes half damage.  


### Doomquake Battle Smith Upgrade

The Doomquake Battle Smith can have any of the following upgrades. Its challenge rating (CR) increases by 1 for each upgrade it has.

##### Doomquake Battle Smith Upgrade
| d3  | Upgrade |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Deafening Thunder.***  Creatures sheathed in booming energy or standing in a vibrating area are deafened and cannot cast spells with a verbal component. A creature that fails a Constitution saving throw suffers these effects until the end of the dwarf’s next turn.

|  2  | ***Shockwave.***  The area of the Doomquake Slam increases to a 60-foot-long, 15-foot-wide line originating from the dwarf.
|  3  | ***Seismic Snare.*** When a creature fails the Dexterity saving throw against the Doomquake Slam while standing on earth or stone, it becomes buried as it sinks into the ground. A buried creature is restrained. Any creature, including the buried one, can use its action to free the buried creature by succeeding on a DC 14 Strength check. A creature making this check has advantage if it has a burrow speed.|

On a failed save, a creature takes 16 (3d10) fire damage and ignites. On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't ignited. An ignited creature takes 5 (1d10) fire damage at the end of each of its turns until it uses an action to douse the flames.

##### Magma Cannoneer Upgrade
| d3  | Upgrade |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Caustic Tar.*** A creature ignited by the Magma Spray ability is also restrained. If a creature uses its action to douse the flames, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength check. On a failure, the flames are not extinguished.
|  2  | ***Pyretic Acid.***  The magma cannoneer now deals acid damage instead of fire damage. Whenever a creature takes acid damage from the magma cannoneer, any armor it is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.
|  3  | ***Stinking Sulfur.*** Each creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of an ignited creature must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the end of its current turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature is dazed (see new condition) and can’t cast spells other than cantrips.|

\columnbreak

### New Condition: Dazed 
A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

## Infernal Defenders
Infernal defenders are cruel guardians fashioned by fel dwarf artificers using unholy methods similar to those employed in creating infernal destroyers. A lesser demon is bound into a body forged of metal and stone. These forms vary in shape, ranging from steel hounds with snapping jaws to brass bulls with searing horns, or vaguely humanoid figures twisted from obsidian.

Though these creations burn with the hatred of their imprisoned demons, they remain unwaveringly loyal to their masters, unleashing onslaughts of terrible fire upon their enemies. On command, the demon can channel its suppressed fury into another creature, allowing the recipient to deliver unnaturally brutal strikes at the cost of their own body, which is torn apart by the demon’s rage.

### Infernal Defender Tactics
The following tips can help you run infernal defenders in combat more effectively. In combat the infernal defender:
* Stays near its creator as a pseudo-protector and supporter.
* Utilizes Rebuke Attack to defend its allies.
* Employs Strain ability when commanded; it's most effective when used on targets:
    * Capable of dealing at least 20 damage with a single attack. (e.g., Deathscreecher Artillerist)
    * Possessing powers associated with their strikes (e.g., Doomquake Battle Smith.)

### Infernal Defender Variants

The type of demon bound to the construct can vary. You can apply one of the following abilities to the infernal defender to represent this, increasing its challenge rating (CR) by 1.

##### Infernal Defender Variants
| d3  | Ability |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Forge-Bound Demon.***  Creatures holding a metal object have disadvantage on saving throws against the Defender’s Rebuke attack. Additionally, if a creature fails a saving throw against the Rebuke Attack, a metal object of the Defender’s choice the creature is holding becomes red-hot for the next minute. A creature holding a object heated this way has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks unless it is immune to fire damage.|
|  2  | ***Shadow-Bound Demon.***  The defender now deals psychic damage instead of fire damage and is immune to psychic damage instead of fire damage. Its Rebuke Attack forces a creature to make a Wisdom saving throw instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, if a creature fails the save, it is blinded, in addition to taking damage. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the start of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.|
|  3  | **Hunger-Bound Demon.** The defender now deals necrotic instead of fire damage and is immune to necrotic damage instead of fire damage. Its Rebuke Attack forces a creature to make a Constitution saving throw instead of a Dexterity saving throw. Additionally, the Defender heals a creature of it's choice within 5 feet of it a number of hit points equal to the damage dealt by its Rebuke Attack. |

## Doom Cannons
A terrifying fusion of demon and war machine, the doom cannon stands as the pinnacle of fel dwarf siegecraft. This nightmarish engine is created by binding the soul of a powerful demon into brass and iron. The imprisoned spirit grants the cannon a horrifying semblance of life—groaning and shaking with unearthly hatred, yearning only for destruction.

These cursed weapons are overseen by sadistic engineers, typically fel dwarfs, who do not merely crew the doom cannon but rather guide it as one would a rabid beast. They feed the war machine freshly slain bodies, shoveling corpses into its rear chamber. Within the infernal mechanism, flesh and bone are swiftly liquefied, their souls extracted to fuel its chaotic flames. These unnatural fires erupt from the cannon’s maw,  scorching the battlefield and warping anything unfortunate enough to be caught in their wake.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

Among the deadliest instruments in the fel dwarfs’ arsenal, doom cannons are often sold to unholy warbands in exchange for vast hoards of slaves or plundered wealth. Tribes of fiend-worshipping marauders and orders of dark knights frequently employ them as artillery in their accursed crusades. However, those who wield these monstrous weapons must eventually pay the true price of their power.

Even with experienced handlers, the safeguards meant to contain the demon within inevitably fail. Many doom cannons have surged forward into enemy lines, abandoning their handlers in fits of uncontrollable bloodlust. At other times, the chaotic energies within grow unstable, causing deadly magical disruptions or leading to catastrophic explosions that consume all nearby—friend and foe alike. Some turn upon their own masters, scarring their minds with unspeakable horrors—or worse, drag them screaming into their fiery cores, where their souls remain trapped within the infernal machine.

> 
> ***Fire! (Recharges when the cannon consumes a corpse or after a long rest).*** The cannon fires a bolt of chaos flames at a point 30 to 600 feet away from itself. Each creature within 15 feet of that point must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success. This damage ignores fire resistance. If a creature fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it suffers a mutation* (Mutation Save DC 18).

### Ice-Forged Doom Cannon
In the cursed, frostbitten lands where malevolent forces hold sway, the fel dwarfs devised a chilling variant of the doom cannon: the ice-forged doom cannon. Unlike its fiery counterpart, this dreadful siege engine is crafted by subjugating the living nightmares that haunt the frozen wastes.

When fed a corpse, the engine grinds the body into crimson ice shards, transmuting the remains into its deadly ammunition.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

It then unleashes them in a merciless barrage of unholy frost. This accursed ammunition mercilessly drains the warmth and vitality from its victims, leaving only frozen husks behind.

Many savage barbarian tribes dwelling in these forsaken lands pay exorbitant sums to acquire such weapons, and survivors of an ice-forged doom cannon’s onslaught often find themselves swiftly overwhelmed by zealots of the dark gods.

### Doom Cannon of Damnation
The doom cannon of damnation is an even more powerful iteration of the doom cannon—an exceedingly rare and perilous creation, requiring the greatest mastery of dark artificers. Unlike its predecessors, this monstrous weapon does not merely rain fire or ice upon its enemies; instead, it unleashes torrents of soul-rending energy.

Those caught in its malignant blasts have their very essence wrenched from their bodies, their souls drawn into the cannon to fuel its devastating black magic. A single doom cannon of damnation can reap the souls of entire armies, trapping them within its iron frame to perpetuate its insatiable hunger.

\columnbreak

<br>

Yet, for all its devastating power, even the most ruthless warlords hesitate to wield such a weapon. Should the demon within ever break free, the consequences would be catastrophic. There are whispers of a battle where one such cannon escaped its handlers' control, feasting indiscriminately upon all combatants. When the dust settled, nothing remained of the armies that had clashed—only the doom cannon of damnation itself, rolling onward across the land, with the souls of every fallen warrior stowed within its depths.

### Doom Cannon Mishap Table

| d6  | Mishap Name         | Mishap Effect |
|:----:|:------------------|:--------------|
| **1**  | Demonic Rush | The cannon must move toward the closest non-bound creature it can see and then use its action to make a slam attack against it if the creature is within range. If the creature is not within range, it takes the Dash action to move closer to the target. |
| **2**  | Fel Feedback | The cannon's energies backlash, disrupting the winds of magic. Until the end of its next turn, the cannon cannot use its Fire! ability, and any creature that attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher within 300 feet of the cannon must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3 (1d6) force damage per level of the spell, and the spell has no effect and is wasted. |
| **3**  | Vengeful Rampage | The cannon lashes out, using its action to make a slam attack against each creature within 5 feet. |
| **4**  | Pulse of Terror | The cannon's demonic essence instills terror in those around it. Each creature bound to the cannon within 30 feet becomes frightened of it until the end of the cannon's next turn. While frightened, affected creatures cannot take reactions and must use the Dash action on their turn, moving away from the cannon by the safest available route. |
| **5**  | Unstable Blast | The cannon's speed becomes 0 until the start of its next turn. Its Fire! ability recharges and must be used this turn. All creatures targeted by the blast have disadvantage on the saving throw. |
| **6**  | Free at Last! | The cannon explodes, destroying itself. Each creature within 30 feet suffers the effects of its Fire! ability as if they were in its blast radius and have disadvantage on the saving throw. |

### Doom Cannon Tactics
Doom cannons are usually operated by Fel Dwarf engineers who keep them supplied with corpses. When well-fed, they stay back and bombard enemies from a distance.

If they run out of bodies, their handlers let them charge into enemy lines to refuel. When left on their own, doom cannons have no tactics, only an uncontrollable urge to destroy.

### New Condition: Mutated
When a creature is affected by this condition, it suffers one of the random mutations described in the Mutation Table below. A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

Unless an ability states otherwise, a creature suffering from one or more mutations can make a Charisma saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effects of all mutations on a success. The save DC is equal to the highest save DC among any effects that inflicted it with its current mutations.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation |  Creature Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The creature can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three. |
|  2  | Degeneration  | The creature's form becomes brittle.  While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The creature can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components and it has disadvantage on all weapon attack rolls.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The creature is blinded.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The creature falls prone and can't stand up.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The creature regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.|
