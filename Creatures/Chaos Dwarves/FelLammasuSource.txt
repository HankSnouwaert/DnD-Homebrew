## Fel Lammasus


Within the darkest reaches of the world, few monstrosities embody as dangerous a blend of bestial might and sorcerous cunning as the lammasu. With the hind legs of a bull and the forelegs of a lion, it sports two massive, leathery wings sprouting from its back. Its most striking feature, however, is its head—a grotesque visage of a male dwarf, warped with sharp teeth, glazed eyes, and a blazing orange beard and mane that blend seamlessly together.

Though the lammasu's sharp claws and long teeth, combined with its muscular body, can easily tear a man to pieces in seconds, it is the creature’s arcane nature and natural guile that one must truly fear. Lammasus wield powerful spells with ease, breathing in the winds of magic and exhaling faint, cold smoke saturated with dark sorcery. This miasmic cloud lingers around the creature, impeding spells that might otherwise end its life and smothering the enchantments of magical weapons and armor, rendering them no more effective than mundane tools.

Despite its lethal arsenal, the lammasu often avoids direct combat, preferring instead to manipulate others into furthering its vile machinations. Though its repulsive appearance might suggest otherwise, lammasus possess innate intelligence and charisma intertwined with their magical nature, allowing them to bend less clever creatures—such as wyverns, griffins, and even tribal humanoids to their will.

Lammasus make their homes in places where the permeations of magic are strongest. Depending on the type of magic saturating a region, a lammasu's appearance and sorcery may be altered. Those dwelling in volcanic craters may have hellish red skin, obsidian claws, and the ability to summon gouts of fire to wash over their foes. Lammasus inhabiting tar pits, graveyards, or other places steeped in death often have gaunt, gray skin and pale white beards that fill mortals with an overwhelming dread of death itself. In the deep caverns and crevices where light is forsaken, lammasus stalk with panther-like coats and gleaming eyes, capable of twisting minds into knots and reducing victims to bewildered invalids. Meanwhile, those that claim abandoned factories or forges, once beacons of great industry, develop brass hides and metallic manes, transforming into monstrosities that can reduce masterwork weapons to cumbersome hunks of lead with a single breath.

Fel dwarves and other practitioners of forbidden arts prize lammasus as mounts of war, using their dark magics in tandem with the creature's own powers. However, while many who seek out a lammasu succeed in capturing one, it is often because the lammasu has deliberately allowed itself to be "tamed." In truth, it slowly manipulates its handler into unwittingly acting in its favor, eventually usurping the would-be master. Some individuals, however, are not so easily outwitted. This leads to a battle of wits between rider and mount, as each attempts to deceitfully bend the other to their will.

### Fel Lammasu Tactics
Fel lammasu are highly intelligent and cautious creatures. They avoid combat unless they have a clear advantage and will flee if threatened. Even when used as mounts, they act independently and in their own best interest.

Their typical strategy is to wait for enemies to group together before swooping in, attacking, and grappling a target to drag it away.

##### Lore of Death Lammasu
* Uses its *fear* spell to scatter enemies
* If a target becomes isolated, it launches a full attack, grapples, and flies away with them
* Uses *crippling breath* to weaken grouped enemies
* Finishes off wounded targets that escape with blight.

##### Lore of Fel Dwarves Lammasu
* Starts with *subjugating breath* to weaken foes
* Uses *magmatic stone* on grouped enemies (the lammasu is immune to fire and pursues foes through the flames)
* If enemies spread out, it grapples an isolated target
* Saves *curse of stone* for the highest HP foe who's not already debuffed

##### Lore of Fire Lammasu
* Uses Breath Weapon on enemies carrying metal weapons
* Weakens armor with *plague of rust*, then attacks and drags a target away
* Uses *searing shard* if its not grappling its chosen victim

\columnbreak

##### Lore of Shadow Lammasu
* Uses its Breath Weapon to scatter enemies
* Casts *withering resolve* on an isolated target, then follows up with *phantasmal killer* for a finishing blow



### Fel Lammasu Adventure Hooks
| d6 | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Lammasu’s Puppet.** A fel dwarf warlord has grown far more aggressive and successful, thanks to their mount—a fel lammasu. Unknown to all, the lammasu is the true mastermind, manipulating the warlord into gathering resources for its own mysterious goals. |
|  2  |**The Usurped Chieftain.** A savage tribe—such as orcish raiders—has been unusually strategic in its attacks. A cunning lammasu, posing as their spiritual leader, has secretly taken control, using them as pawns in its grander schemes.  |
|  3  | **The Lammasu’s Offer.** The party meets a lammasu willing to bargain instead of fight. It offers to help defeat a powerful foe if they assist it in reclaiming its “stolen throne” from a rival fel dwarf faction in a mountain fortress. |
|  4  |**The Lammasu’s Gambit.** A lammasu asks for the party’s help to escape its “captor,” a powerful fel dwarf lord using it as an advisor. The plea is a ruse, as the lammasu intends to overthrow the lord and take their place as ruler.    |

> 
> ***Magic Resistance.*** The lammasu has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.  
> 
> ***Sorcerous Miasma.*** The lammasu emits a miasma in a 10-foot emanation. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed while within the miasma. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the miasma or wielded by an attacker in the miasma. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition leaves the miasma (e.g., a magic arrow fired at a target outside the miasma), its magic properties cease to be suppressed as soon as it exits.  
> 
> ### Actions  
> 
> ***Multiattack.*** The lammasu makes two attacks: one with its Bite and one with its Claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the lammasu cannot attack another target.  
> 
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the target is prone, the attack deals 23 (4d8 + 5) piercing damage plus 18 (4d8) fire damage instead.  
> 
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) fire damage. If the lammasu moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  
> 
> ***Innate Spellcasting.*** The lammasu is a spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). The spells and breath weapon the lammasu knows depend on the lore of magic it has specialized in, as described in its Lore of Magic trait. It requires no material components for its spells.  
> 
> ***Breath Weapon (Recharges on a Short or Long Rest).*** The lammasu exhales its breath weapon, as determined by its Lore of Magic.
>
> ### Bonus Actions  
> 
> ***War Caster.*** When the lammasu uses its action to cast a spell or use its Breath Weapon, it can make a claw attack.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save.

A burning target sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet, and it can’t benefit from being invisible. At the end of each of its turns while on fire, the target takes 10 (4d4) fire damage. A creature can use its action to douse the fire by making a DC 16 Dexterity check. On a success, the flames are extinguished. The flames are also extinguished if the creature is fully submerged in water or standing in an area with strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour).

Each Medium or Small manufactured metal object that weighs 80 pounds or less in the cone, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock, has its weight increased by 40 pounds for 1 minute. Additionally, a creature can no longer add its Dexterity modifier to attack and damage rolls made with the weapon. If the creature's Strength score is lower than 16, it has disadvantage on all attacks made with the weapon. If the targeted item is armor, its Strength requirement becomes 16 if it is lower. A creature in the cone may make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw to avoid having any object it is wearing or carrying be affected by the breath.

While mystified, the creature uses all its movement to travel in a random direction at the start of its turn, determined by rolling a d8. After moving, it can take the rest of its turn as normal. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a successful save.

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

You send a sizzling jagged silver shard from your fingertips flying at one creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 2d4 piercing damage, and the shard embeds in the creature. At the end of the creature's next turn, it takes 2d10 fire damage if the shard is still embedded.

**Removing The Shard.** A creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the shard. On a success, the shard is removed, and on a failure, the shard is still removed, but the creature takes 2d4 slashing damage.

**At Higher Levels.**  When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the piercing and slashing damage each increase by 1d4, and the fire damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 1st.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 3.



### Fel Lammasu Loot
The valuable items looted from lammasus will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest the hide or beard of a lammasu. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.
