## Zhartahn, The Dark
*Dwarven Tyrant of Cruel Domination*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>

In the ash-choked badlands, where once green things grew and flourished and now only the wicked thrive, there rise into the sky a monolith of black whose shadows fall long even through the ashen winds that veil the cursed land in a sorrowful haze. 

If one were to brave those bleak and lifeless wastes, they would come upon a city torn from the dreams of demons and hammered into being by hate—where factories scream horrid songs and foul smoke billows from their roofs, as twisted engines of death are birthed. Great temples of tarnished bronze stand as an affront to all that is sacred, their walls adorned with carved effigies of horned and hideous gods—bovine lords hewn in obsidian, before whom blasphemous rites are offered. And ever above them all rise towers wrought of blackest iron, spearing the smothered sky, where the demon-smiths hold counsel and overlook with pride the hellscape they have wrought.

Yet not in those dread halls are the vilest works performed, but rather far below, in the bowels of the earth itself. There, beneath the streets and furnaces, are the true horrors made manifest. The slave-pits stretch deep into the bones of the world to gather its poisonous wealth, and within them, throngs of broken souls labour without rest, goaded on by cruel taskmasters. And among these, none are more feared than Zhartahn the Dark.

Zhartahn, who hungers for agony, is the most beloved of the priest-smiths, for his cruelty yields vast tribute.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 When his thralls falter, Zhartahn devises fresh torments, crafting pain with as much care as an artist might hew a statue from marble. Thus, the mines flourish beneath his ire, though the life is soon drained from all who toil within.


And when the mines are emptied of strength and the pits echo only with death, Zhartahn rises again with his host of fel warriors, clad in infernal mail and bearing weapons born of hatred and hell. Beyond the blasted lands they march, into the green and living world, that he might bring back new souls to feed the city’s ever-hungering forges. The folk of the fields are taken in chains.
So great is the malice of his tongue, and so heavy the dread in his voice, that even armed hosts falter. Steel stays, and hearts crumble. Many cast down their blades and kneel, pleading for mercy—yet Zhartahn has none to give. Their submission only stokes the fire of his wicked joy.

But those few who resist—who dare to rise against his coming—earn only his wrath. With obsidian axes he carves ruin into their ranks, each stroke a harbinger of pain, each wound a vessel of torment. Even the bravest fall shrieking, their courage undone.
So has it always been. No city, no fortress, no army has yet broken the yoke of Zhartahn. All are brought to heel, and their people bound in service to the black city and the demon-smiths who rule it.

Yet in the shadows of that dread dominion, among the tattered remnants of conquered peoples, there flickers still a spark. Some yet believe that Zhartahn shall one day be met not with fear, but with defiance—that a company of souls, unbent and unbroken, shall rise to end his boundless cruelty.

### Zhartahn Abarzug's Lair

Zhartahn and Abarzug make their lairs in a fel dwarf garrison tower amid a grand city. Below are miles of volcanic tunnels where all manner of slaves toil under the cruel supervision of armed fel dwarves to harvest valuable minerals. These slaves will fight to the death if commanded to do so, for to die in battle would be a sweet release compared to the punishment that would follow if they refuse the commands of their dark masters.

When fighting within their lair, Zhartahn and Abarzug's Challenge Ratings (CR) increase by 1.

#### Lair Action
When either Zhartahn or Abarzug rolls initiative, their lair awakens to aid them. Until combat ends or both die, the lair has an Intelligence of 16 and can act of its own accord, always acting in the best interest of both. While active in this way, the lair is aware of the location of all creatures within it. On initiative count 0 (losing initiative ties), the lair chooses two Subjugated Workers within it (stat block found after Zhartahn and Abarzug's). They gain 20 temporary hit points for the next minute. While they have these temporary hit points, they are dominated (as described in their stat block) and under the control of the lair.

Whenever a dominated target receives an effect that would end the Frightened or Charmed condition, it loses all of its temporary hit points and ceases to be dominated.

\columnbreak

#### Regional Effects
The area where Zhartahn and Abarzug dwell is corrupted by their presence, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of their lair:

* Whenever a creature hostile to Zhartahn or Abarzug is reduced to 0 hit points within the area, it must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 18.<br>
*Failure:* For the next hour, it cannot cause creatures to be Charmed or Frightened by it, and the creature has disadvantage on Charisma checks and saving throws against being Charmed or Frightened.
* Whenever a creature hostile to Zhartahn or Abarzug attempts to telepathically communicate in the area, it must make an *Intelligence Saving Throw:* DC 18.<br>
*Failure:* It takes 18 (4d8) psychic damage and fails to communicate.<br>
*Success:* It can communicate telepathically for the next 10 minutes without having to make a saving throw.
* Water sources within 5 miles of the lair are supernaturally warm and tainted with sulfur.
* Storms of hot ash are frequent.



### Epic Battle: Twin Lords of Suffering
If you want to have Zhartahn and Abarzug work together to make a true endgame threat, make the following changes to them and treat them as having a combined Challenge Rating (CR) or 23:

* Whenever Zhartahn or Abarzug gain Cruelty, the other also gains the same amount of Cruelty.
* Whenever Zhartahn or Abarzug dies the other gains five levels of Cruelty

>
> ***Multiattack.*** Zhartahn can make two attacks. He can replace one attack with Sadistic Snare.
>
>
> ***Obsidian Axe.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit (with advantage if it is an attack of opportunity), reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 13 (2d8 + 4) Slashing damage plus Psychic damage equal to amount Cruelty he has. Zhartahn then gains one level of Cruelty if the target is Frightened or Restrained. If the target is reduced to 0 hit points, it is Stunned for 1 minute, and Zhartahn gains three levels of Cruelty.
>
>
> ***Blunderbuss.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit (ignores half and three-quarters cover, and disadvantage from long range while Zhartahn is Resolute*), range 80/320 ft., one target. *Hit:* 26 (4d10 + 4) Piercing damage plus Psychic damage equal to amount Cruelty he has, and the target’s speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the end of its next turn. Zhartahn can’t make this attack again until he reloads the weapon as an action or becomes Resolute*.
>
> ***Sadistic Snare (3/Day).*** *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 17, One Large or smaller target Zhartahn can see within 30 feet <br>
> *Failure:* The target is Restrained until the snare is destroyed (AC 18; HP 15; immunity to Bludgeoning, Poison, and Psychic damage). A creature can take an action to make a DC 17 Strength (Athletics) check to free itself or another creature in a net within 5 feet, destroying the net on a success. If a creature ends its turn in the net, Zhartahn gains one level of Cruelty.
>
> ### Bonus Actions
>
> ***Resolute Stance.*** At the start of Zhartahn’s turn, he becomes Resolute* until the start of his next turn.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Zhartahn gains two additional actions in combat: Subjugating Order and Tyrant’s Claim. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count, separate from Zhartahn's. On the action's initiative count (losing ties), Zhartahn can take the action if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Subjugating Order (Initiative Count 21).*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 18, two creatures within 60 feet of Zhartahn that were not targeted by this ability during the last round <br>
> *Failure:* The target becomes Frightened of Zhartahn, and Zhartahn gains one level of Cruelty. While Frightened in this way, the target is also Charmed by Zhartahn. The Frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If it fails this saving throw, it falls Prone, and Zhartahn gains one level of Cruelty.
>
> ***Tyrant’s Claim (Initiative Count 1).*** Zhartahn lets loose a claim of his dominance. Any creature within 25 feet of Zhartahn that is not Frightened or Restrained can challenge him. If more than one creature challenges him, he can choose one. Zhartahn or a creature he is mounted on can then move up to 25 feet towards a chosen creature that challenged him, and then Zhartahn makes an attack against that creature, dealing an additional 13 (3d8) slashing damage on hit. If no creature challenges Zhartahn, he gains five levels of Cruelty.
>
>
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Zhartahn is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

>
> ***Magic Resistance.*** Abarzug has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
>
> ***Sorcerous Miasma.*** Abarzug emits a miasma in a 10-foot radius emanating from himself. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed while within the miasma. For example, a +1 longsword in the miasma functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the miasma or wielded by an attacker in the miasma. If a magic weapon or piece of magic ammunition leaves the miasma (e.g., a magic arrow fired at a target outside the miasma), its magic properties cease to be suppressed as soon as it exits.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Abarzug makes two attacks: one with his Bite and one with his Claws. If both attacks hit the same target, the target is Grappled (escape DC 17). Until this Grapple ends, Abarzug cannot use his Bite or Claws against another target.
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) Piercing damage plus Psychic damage equal to the number of Cruelty levels Abarzug has. If the target is Prone, the attack deals 23 (4d8 + 5) Piercing damage plus Psychic damage equal to twice the number of Cruelty levels Abarzug has, and Abarzug then gains three levels of Cruelty.
>
> ***Claws.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (1d10 + 5) Slashing damage plus Psychic damage equal to the number of Cruelty levels Abarzug has. If Abarzug moved at least 10 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be knocked Prone.
>
> ### Monstrous Actions
>
> Abarzug gains two additional actions in combat: Ghastly Prison and Withering Breath. Each action can be performed on its own initiative count, separate from Abarzug's. On the action's initiative count (losing ties), Abarzug can take the action if he is not Incapacitated. He can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if Incapacitated.
>
> ***Ghastly Prison (Initiative Count 23).*** *Intelligence Saving Throw:* DC 18, two creatures within 60 feet of Abarzug that were not targeted by this ability during the last round <br>
> *Failure:* Abarzug gains one level of Cruelty, and the target becomes sheathed in phantasms. While sheathed in phantasms, the creature is unable to see anything farther than 10 feet away and Abarzug gains one level of Cruelty at the end of each of the creature’s turns. If the creature willingly moves 5 feet or more, it takes 18 (4d8) Psychic damage, and the effect ends. The target can use its action to examine the phantasm by making a DC 18 Intelligence (Investigation) check; if the check succeeds, the target realizes the phantasm is an illusion, and the effect ends.
>
> ***Withering Breath (On Initiative Count 3).*** Abarzug may move up to 25 feet and then force each creature in a 30-foot cone to make a *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 17.<br>
> *Failure:* Abarzug gains one level of Cruelty, and the creature’s mind becomes filled with doubt until initiative count 1 of the next round. While filled with doubt, the target has disadvantage on all ability checks and saving throws, and attack rolls against it have advantage.
> 
> ***Tenacious Will.*** If Abarzug is subject to an ongoing effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the start or end of his turn, he can immediately make that save with advantage, ending the effect on a success.

### Zhartahn's Tactics
Zhartahn wins through attrition—growing stronger as the battle drags on and accumulating Cruelty until he can crush his foes.

**Subjugating Order.** Zhartahn targets two creatures with the lowest Wisdom saving throws or highest remaining hit points, aiming to incapacitate and remove them from the fight early.

**Normal Turn Sequence.** Zhartahn begins by using Resolute Stance to prolong his presence on the battlefield and build Cruelty. He then snares the nearest target and follows up with an Obsidian Axe attack. If no enemies are in melee range, he snares a target with low Dexterity and shoots them with his Blunderbuss.

**Tyrant’s Claim.** This ability is reactive and dependent on enemy behavior. Zhartahn can use it to reduce the number of enemies that can challenge him by inflicting Frightened or Restrained conditions, ideally disabling as many opponents as possible.

\columnbreak

### Abarzug's Tactics
Abarzug also fights a war of attrition, using flight to avoid being surrounded and control positioning.

**Ghastly Prison.** Abarzug targets two closely grouped enemies, prioritizing those with low Intelligence saving throws. This limits their ability to spread out and makes them more vulnerable to his Withering Breath.

**Normal Turn Sequence.** Abarzug targets a creature with low Strength, under the effects of Withering Breath, or one that is isolated, and tries to  Grapple it and drag it into a more favorable position.

**Withering Breath.** Abarzug uses this as soon as he can affect multiple enemies. Ideally, his Ghastly Prison and movement on prior turns have maneuvered targets into a tightly packed group for maximum effect.
 
### Subjugated Worker Tactics
The primary goal of the subjugated workers is to help accumulate Cruelty. They attack any targets they can gain advantage against and are considered expendable—often positioned to be struck by Withering Breath to further fuel cruelty gain.

##### Zhartahn, The Dark Adventure Hooks
| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The March of Iron and Smoke:** Zhartahn the Dark has launched a brutal campaign across the borderlands, leading his forces atop Abarzug, whose psychic influence leaves entire garrisons paralyzed with fear before the battle begins. The party is hired by a desperate alliance of frontier lords to assassinate Zhartahn—or find a way to sever the bond between him and the lammasu|
|  2  | **The Burnt Standard:** Zhartahn has defiled a sacred dwarven monument, melting its ancestral runes into slag to forge a new standard for his legion. Now, the spirits of the fallen clans cry for vengeance. The party is enlisted to recover the desecrated relic from the heart of Zhartahn’s war camp |
|  3  | **Chains for the Sun:** Zhartahn has enslaved a fire elemental shrine and forced it to burn perpetually to fuel his forges. Abarzug has taken up residence near the altar, warping the local ley lines with his presence. The area suffers from unnatural eclipses and solar flares. The party is approached by sun priests or elemental guardians who need help purging the shrine and breaking Zhartahn’s hold.|
|  4  |**The Black Procession:** Zhartahn is escorting a caravan of chained prisoners and infernal war machines toward a gate said to lead into the Plane of Fire. He intends to trade the captives—and a secret artifact—to a fiery lord in exchange for a legion of flameborn horrors. The party must intercept the procession before the pact is sealed, or venture into the Plane of Fire to undo it after the fact. |

\pagebreakNum




### Zhartahn's Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from fel dwarves are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. 

Valuable lammasu loot typically comes from harvested materials and usually requires a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Arcana)** check. You may also allow players proficient in specific tools to harvest relevant items (e.g., a **Wisdom (Leatherworker’s Tools)** check to gather Hide). 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


##### Zhartahn, The Dark & Abarzug, the Tormenter Loot Table  (Avg. 1,500gp)

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Item |
|  10-13 | 1d4(2) 500gp Items | 
|  14-20 | 1 1,000gp Item  |  
|  21-25 | 1 2,000gp Item |  
|  26+ |  1d4(2) 2,000gp Items |  



### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.



For example, a 1,000gp Bone item from a Zhartahn could be a Tyrant's Trophy Skull, a 500gp version might be a Cracked Tyrant's Trophy Skull, and a 2,000gp version could be a Pristine Tyrant's Trophy Skull.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Zhartahn, The Dark Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Tyrant's Trophy Skull (Cracked/Pristine) | 
| 2   | Jewelry | Zhartahn's Insigina (Lesser/Greater)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Zhartahn's Armament (Damaged/Masterwork) |

##### Abarzug, the Tormenter Materials: 1,000gp

| 5-6   | Flesh | Abarzug's Heart (Damaged/Pristine)|

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of Zhartahn and Abarzug, Fiendish effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that steal the lives of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.
