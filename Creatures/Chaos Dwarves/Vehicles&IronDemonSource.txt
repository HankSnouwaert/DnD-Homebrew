# Self-Propelled Vehicles
Most land vehicles in fantasy settings are pulled by other creatures, such as wagons, carriages, or chariots. However, through some combination of technology or magic, some vehicles may be self-propelled and driven by a passenger. These may be relatively small mechanical contraptions, magically self-propelled carriages, or mighty war machines rumbling across blasted battlefields. 

The following rules can help you codify how to use these vehicle types in your games. They can be applied to vehicles of different shapes and sizes and used as tools for designing your own vehicles. The rules here can be applied to most self-powered vehicles piloted by a passenger. 

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Rules
Self-propelled vehicles are vehicles able to move without needing to be pushed or pulled by another creature, and they usually don’t need an external energy source (such as wind). Throughout this document, they will be referred to simply as vehicles. Creatures within a vehicle are referred to as passengers. 
In combat, vehicles use most of the same rules as creatures, with the following additional considerations:

### Opportunity Attacks
War machines provoke opportunity attacks as usual. When a war machine provokes an opportunity attack, the attacker can target the vehicle itself or any creature riding on or inside it, provided they are within reach and do not have total cover.

### Spacing Within Vehicles
All creatures within a vehicle count as being within 5 feet of each other.

### Entering and Exiting Vehicles
Entering or exiting the vehicle costs a creature half of its movement. Each creature inside the vehicle may use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against the creature entering or exiting.

### Crashing into Creatures and Objects
A vehicle can crash into a creature or object by entering its space. When it does, the creature or object must make a Dexterity or Strength saving throw (the target's choice) using the vehicle's DC. On a failed save, the target takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet the vehicle moved in a straight line before attempting to enter the target's space (maximum 20d6 damage).

If the target is a creature, it is also knocked prone. On a successful Dexterity save, the target takes no damage and is not knocked prone. On a successful Strength save, the creature takes half damage, is not knocked prone, and the vehicle's speed becomes 0 until the end of the turn. A target can only make this saving throw once per turn.

If the vehicle is at least two size categories larger than the target it crashed into, it can continue moving through the target's space if it has any movement remaining. Otherwise, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop. If the target is an impassable object that could reasonably damage the war machine, such as an iron wall, the vehicle comes to a sudden stop and takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it moved since its last turn (maximum 20d6 damage). Each creature on or inside the vehicle when it 

### Falling Vehicles
When a vehicle goes falls from a height of 10 feet or higher, it and all creatures on or inside it take damage from the fall as normal and land in a prone position. (**NOTE: No jumping off ramps?**)


### Repairing Vehicles
If a vehicle has taken damage but still has at least 1 hit point, a creature can spend 1 hour or more attempting to repair the damage. The vehicle must be stationary, and the creature must have the necessary tools and parts for the repairs. After 1 hour of repair work, the creature makes an Intelligence check, adding its proficiency bonus to the check if it is proficient with the tools required for the repairs. If the check succeeds, the vehicle regains 2d4 + its Intelligence modifier + its proficiency bonus hit points. If the check fails, the vehicle does not regain any hit points, but the repair can be attempted again using the same tools and replacement parts.

### Vehicular Exhaustion 
Certain circumstances can cause a war machine to malfunction and eventually break down due to wear and tear. This wear and tear can be represented using exhaustion rules, as described in Appendix A of the Player's Handbook, with the following modifications:

* When a war machine reaches exhaustion level 6, its hit points drop to 0, and the vehicle breaks down.
* The only way to remove the effects of exhaustion on a war machine is through repair. This can be done using the rules described in the Repairing Vehicles section above. If the attempt to repair the vehicle succeeds, the vehicle's exhaustion level decreases by 1. If the check fails, the vehicle's exhaustion level remains unchanged, but the repair attempt can be made again using the same tools and replacement parts.

## Self-Propelled Vehicle Attributes
Besides the size, weight, AC, HP, and damage immunity attributes common to all objects, these vehicles have the following additional attributes and considerations:

### Hit Points 
A war machine's hit points can be restored through vehicle repairs. However, when a war machine's hit points reach 0, it becomes inoperative and is irreparably damaged.
### Damage Threshold
Most vehicles possess bulk or armor that enables them to withstand minor hits. A vehicle with a damage threshold is immune to all damage unless the amount of damage it takes is equal to or greater than its damage threshold value. In such cases, the vehicle takes damage as usual. Damage that fails to meet or exceed the vehicle's damage threshold is considered superficial and does not reduce the vehicle's hit points.
### Mishap Threshold
When a vehicle sustains damage from a single source that is equal to or exceeds its mishap threshold, it is required to roll on the Mishaps table (refer to the Mishaps section).
### Creature Capacity 
Creature capacity determines the number of creatures that can ride the vehicle comfortably. Additional creatures can fit by squeezing or clinging to the outside of the vehicle.
### Cargo Capacity
Cargo capacity indicates the maximum weight of cargo the vehicle can carry.
### Vehicle DC 
Whenever the vehicle requires a creature to make a check or saving throw, it uses this number as the DC.
### Challenge Rating
When players face enemies that are equipped with a fully functioning vehicle, the challenge rating (CR) of the encounter should be calculated as if the vehicle is an additional creature with its own CR.
### Ability Scores 
A war machine possesses the standard six ability scores that creatures have, along with their corresponding modifiers. The Strength of the vehicle is determined by its size and weight, while Dexterity represents its handling and maneuverability. The Constitution of a war machine reflects its durability and quality of construction. In most cases, war machines have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.

If a war machine has a score of 0 in a particular ability score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that relies on that score.



### Action Stations
A vehicle may have one or more Action Stations. Each of these stations requires a certain number of creatures to operate and may grant those creatures some amount of cover. The creatures operating these stations must be passengers within the vehicle, but not all passengers need to be operating a station. A creature operating a station can use an action to activate the station's effect. A station can be occupied by only one creature at a time and can only be activated once per turn. 

#### The Helm 
Most vehicles that must be piloted by a passenger (referred to as the driver) have an Action Station known as the Helm, where the vehicle's movement is controlled. It usually consists of a chair equipped with a wheel, levers, pedals, and other controls. If a vehicle has a helm with no one operating it, it automatically fails Dexterity saving throws. A driver who is proficient with land vehicles can add their proficiency bonus to ability checks and saving throws made using the vehicle's ability scores.

The driver can use an action to propel the vehicle up to its speed or bring it to a complete stop. While the vehicle is in motion, the driver can steer it along any desired course. If the driver becomes incapacitated, leaves the helm, or takes no action to alter the vehicle's course and speed, the vehicle will continue moving in the same direction and at the same speed as it did during the driver's last turn until it collides with an obstacle large enough to stop its movement.


### Mishaps
Most vehicles have a Mishaps Table which describes different ways its functionality can fo awry under adverse conditions. When certain abilities or conditions dictate, roll on this Mishaps Table. 

To resolve a Mishap, a creature can use its action to make an ability check based on the nature of the mishap (refer to the Mishaps section). If the vehicle is moving, the check is made with disadvantage. If the creature is proficient with the tools required for the repairs and has them at hand, it adds its proficiency bonus to the check. A successful check ends the mishap. Mishaps that do not have a repair DC cannot be repaired.
