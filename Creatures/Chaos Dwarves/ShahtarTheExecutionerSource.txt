## Shah'tar, The Grand Executioner
*Most Dreaded of All Bull Centaurs*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>
In a desolate land where ash lies thick upon the ground, and clouds of black smoke conceal the earth from the idle gaze of the heavens, there winds a river of broken peoples—gathered from many lands, chained one to another like pebbles heaped by the will of crueler hands. At their flanks strode the dwarfs, grim and gleeful, whose whips cracked like thunder, driving the wretched forward without word or mercy.

Through dust-choked vistas they marched, mile upon mournful mile, until from the haze arose a temple—tall and black, and sudden as a robber springing from shadow.

Its gates, wrought of iron and rimmed with carvings of winged beasts most foul, yawned wide like the mouth of some ravenous demon, eager to devour the throng that marched toward it. Within, the slaves beheld vast halls, their walls of obsidian lit only by ancient runes that burned—not with fire, but with the hate of the hands that carved them. And in that place there rose a statue, hewn from ebon marble, in the image of a dark and hateful god. Its gaze fell ever downward, filled with scorn for those who crawled at its feet.

There, upon a brass altar beneath that blasphemous effigy, stood a creature made in the likeness of the god that loomed above. Its lower half was that of a mighty bull, shod in hooves like charred stumps of trees, and its hide gleamed like beaten steel. From the waist upward it was a dwarf, though of hue ashen and lifeless, and over its face hung a mask of braided chains, through which gleamed the souls of demons, ever whispering of sin. In its gnarled hands it bore an axe of dreadful beauty, forged of gold and red iron, and faintly the spirits of slaughter could be heard chanting a chorus in praise of the ruin it had wrought.

And those who had come thus far beheld this vision, and terror took them. What little hope had lingered fled from their hearts, and they became still—for no lashing of whips could drive them onward, not to that forsaken god nor to his monstrous servant. But the demons in chains awakened. The scent of fear hung thick in the air, and from the mask they curled forth like serpents of smoke, winding about the slaves and rending flesh and spirit alike, seeking anguish to feast upon before the end.

Then the slaves fell to their knees, and the great beast came near. It raised its axe, and the spirits of slaughter howled. The temple floor shook with the laughter of its hateful god.

Thither go all the rivers of slaves that wander the desolate land, and the end of every river is the same—a sea of blood upon the black temple’s floor.

And upon that sea drift severed heads, their eyes wide with dread, still gazing upward at the monster who had made such a sea, who yet stood unmoving. For he who is forged to wield the blade of death is Shah'tar, The Grand Executioner of the dark god—and his labor shall not cease.

### Shah'tar's Lair
Shah'tar makes his lair within a great temple of the dark god he serves.

When fighting within his lair, Shah'tar's Challenge Rating (CR) increases by 2.

#### Sacrificial Circle
When Shah'tar rolls initiative, his lair awakens to aid him. Until combat ends or Shah'tar dies, the lair has an Intelligence of 14 and can act of its own accord, always acting in the best interest of Shah'tar. While active in this way, the lair is aware of the location of all creatures within it. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lair creates a 10-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of hellish energy centered on a point on the ground within the lair that lasts until initiative count 20 of the next turn. It causes the following effects:

* A creature in the lair that is outside of the cylinder and attempts to cast a spell of 1st level or higher must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 19.<br>
*Failure:* The spell dissipates with no effect, and the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted. If that spell was cast with a spell slot, the slot isn’t expended.<br>
*Success:* The creature casts the spell as normal.
* A creature inside the cylinder that casts a spell of 1st level or higher takes 3 (1d6) necrotic damage per level of the spell. This damage can't be reduced in anyway.
* A creature other than Shah'tar in the lair that is outside of the cylinder subtracts 1d6 from all its damage rolls.
* Whenever a creature other than Shah'tar ends its turn in the cylinder, it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage.


#### Regional Effects
The area where Shah'tar dwells is corrupted by his presence, creating one or more of the following effects everywhere within 5 miles of his lair:

* Whenever a creature hits with an attack that rolls a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 4d6 damage.
* Whenever a creature rolls a 1 on a saving throw, demonic spirits appear and Restrain it until they are destroyed (AC 15; HP 20; immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, Fire, Necrotic, and Poison damage). While Restrained, the creature can't teleport and can't cast spells other than cantrips.
* Any attack that hits creature with 0 hitpoints is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.

These effects gradually dissipate over 1d10 days after Shah'tar's death.

>
> ### Actions
>
>
> ***Multiattack.*** Shah'tar makes two attacks, each with a different weapon.
>

>
> ***Execute.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature that is marked by the Marked for Death trait, Grappled, Prone, or Restrained. *Hit:* 100 slashing damage, or 50 slashing damage if the attack didn’t have advantage.

On the action's initiative count (losing ties), Shah'tar can take the action if he is not incapacitated. He can replace either action with Tenacious Will, even if incapacitated.
>
> ***Proclamation of Doom (Initiative Count 11).*** Shah'tar summons demonic spirits of doom, targeting two creatures within 60 feet of his choice that were not targeted by this ability during the last round. Those creature's must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 19. <br>
> *Failure:* The target takes 13 (3d8) necrotic damage, is moved 10 feet in any direction of Shah'tar's choice, and is Restrained by the demonic spirits until they are destroyed (AC 15; HP 20; immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, Slashing, Fire, Necrotic, and Poison damage).

### Epic Battle: The Mass Executioner
If you wish to make Shah'tar into a true threat worthy of providing the final battle to a campaign, you can double his maximum hit points, bringing the total up to 588 hit points, and give him the Mass Execution trait, described below; this increases his CR to 21.

***Mass Execution (Recharges after a short or long rest).*** If Shah'tar becomes Boodied (294 HP), his Marked for Death trait is immediately triggered, targeting any number of creatures within 90 feet of him. He then replaces his Death Toll action with Massacre, described below.

***Massacre. (Initiative Count 1).*** Shah'tar can move up to 50 feet. During the movement, he may either make one Hamstringing Greataxe or three Execute attacks; each attack must be against a different target.
 
### Shah'tar Tactics
Shah'tar's primary goal in combat is to use his Execution attack to finish off weakened foes.

#### Marked for Death 

Shah'tar designates a preferred target for execution based on one or more of the following factors:

* **Restrained or Prone:** The target is already restrained and/or prone.
* **Reachability:** Shah'tar favors targets he can reach in a straight line, enabling use of his Resolute Charge action.
* **Low Armor Class:** If multiple valid targets are available, he prioritizes the one with the lowest AC, especially if it's Restrained.

#### Normal Turn
On a typical turn, Shah'tar prepares his prey using a combination of:
1. Dazing Gore to knock the target prone
2. Pinning Stomp to restrain them
3. and if the target is already restrained, a combination of Dazing Gore followed by Execution.


#### Proclamation of Doom
This ability targets creatures that are either Marked for Death or have low Charisma saving throws.


#### Death Toll
Shah'tar always attempts an Execution attack if a target is eligible. If no valid execution targets are available, he instead uses his Hamstringing Greataxe to attack a Prone target, if possible.


#### Sacrificial Circle
The Sacrificial Circle cylinder is placed over the largest cluster of Restrained or Prone creatures within range.

### Bull Centaur Executioners
Within the iron temples of the fel dwarves, countless sacrifices are made to appease their avaricious gods. At the heart of the grandest of these macabre rituals stands the hulking figure of a bull centaur executioner. These beasts wear black chain veils over their faces and wield ornately carved axes forged from unholy volcanic rock.

\columnbreak

<br><br>

With deadly precision, they pin down struggling victims beneath their hooves and, with a single decisive swing, separate head from neck. Their strikes are so exact and powerful that even full-grown ogres have been cleanly decapitated in this manner.

#### Bull Centaur Executioner Tactics
Executioners mark creatures with low Strength scores and will relentlessly focus on executing that target for the remainder of the combat.

### Bull Centaur Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from bull centaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.


##### Bull Centaur Executioner Loot Table <br> (Avg. 82gp)

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-6  | 2d6(7) 5gp Items |
|  7-10 | 2d4(5) 10gp Items | 
|  11-17 | 2d6(7) 10gp Items  |  
|  18-22 | 2d4(5) 20gp Items |  
|  23+ |  2d6(7) 20gp Items |  

##### Shah'tar, The Executioner Loot Table <br> (Avg. 2,550gp)


| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Item |
|  10-13 | 1 1,000gp Item | 
|  14-20 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items  |  
|  21-25 | 1d4(2) 2,000gp Items |  
|  26+ |  1d6(3) 2,000gp Items |  

### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Bone item from a bull centaur could be a Bull Centaur Horn, a 5gp version might be a Young Bull Centaur Horn, and a 20gp version could be an Elite Bull Centaur Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Bull Centaur Materials: 10gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Bull Centaur Horn (Young/Elite) | 
| 2   | Jewelry | Obsidian Insigina (Initiate's/Elite)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Bull Centaur Armor Plate (Inferior/Masterwork) |  

\columnbreak

##### Shah'tar Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Executioner's Horn (Damaged/Pristine) | 
| 2   | Jewelry | Executioner's Emblem (Lesser/Greater)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Executioner's Armament (Damaged/Pristine) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of bull centaurs, Fiendish effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that steal the lives of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.
