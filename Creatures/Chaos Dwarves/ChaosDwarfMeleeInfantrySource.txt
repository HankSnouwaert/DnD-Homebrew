### Chaos Dwarf Warriors

These soldiers are the mainstay of their armies, displaying unwavering loyalty and fierce determination in battle. They are often found on the front lines of chaos dwarf forces, ready to face any foe with their cruel battleaxes and sturdy shields. The ring mail they don provides ample protection, while their shields are adorned with dread symbols of their dark allegiance. Like the warriors of their uncorrupted kin, they combine these masterfully crafted armaments with unyielding discipline to become a fighting force to be reckoned with.

Despite being among the lowest-ranking dwarven soldiers in their armies, compared to the warriors of other races, these chaos dwarves are still elite infantry. However, their combat prowess is offset by the relatively small population of their race. As such, chaos dwarf warriors cannot be fielded in the same numbers as warriors of other races and must often rely on a mass fodder force of indentured soldiers to fill out their numbers. Because of this constant need for more cannon fodder, chaos dwarf warriors often engage in raids to capture and conscript new soldiers for their army.

***Blazing Bear Warriors.*** These fiery warriors are a rare and fearsome sect of battle-hardened fighters who have delved deep into the secrets of flame, harnessing its destructive power to rain havoc upon their enemies. They are easily recognized by their brass armaments and flaming hair and beards. The blazing beards are specialized warriors often found in the ranks of the more ruthless and aggressive dwarf factions, using their mastery of flame to demoralize and devastate their foes.

Their prowess in battle is exemplified by their flaming battleaxes, which emit a searing heat that intensifies when either their target or the warrior is engulfed in flames. This fearsome power can turn the tide of battle as their foes are consumed by the relentless inferno.

When blazing beard warriors are able to focus their fury in combat, it manifests as a surge of intense heat that erupts from their very being, igniting any who dare approach. The resulting firestorm serves as a potent deterrent to those who would dare to approach these formidable warriors.

Staying out of range of their attacks proves futile, for most of these dwarves are armed with sinister incendiary devices, which they hurl into crowds of enemies unleashing a devastating inferno that can turn the tide of battle in an instant.

### Infernal Guard

The warriors represent an elite cadre of chaos dwarf soldiers, handpicked from the ranks of their brethren to serve as the vanguard of their dark masters. These fearsome warriors are bound together by a shared history of past failures, which they seek to atone for through unwavering loyalty, unmatched ferocity, and the merciless conquest of their enemies. The path of the infernal guard is one of redemption and suffering, as each member dons an iron mask that obscures their visage, a symbol of their shame and a constant reminder of the debts they must repay.

The iron masks serve not only as a sign of their penance but also as a tool of dehumanization, stripping the infernal guard of their individuality and forging them into a single, cohesive unit. Beneath these forbidding masks, the infernal guard finds solace in their shared purpose and the brutal path toward atonement they have been provided. In battle, these masks instill fear in the hearts of their enemies, as they come to understand that they face an adversary that is relentless, unforgiving, and without mercy.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

In their quest for redemption, the infernal <br> guard is often tasked with carrying out the most <br> dangerous and brutal missions for their dark masters. From leading daring assaults on heavily fortified strongholds to hunting down powerful adversaries deep within enemy territory, the infernal guard willingly accepts any challenge, no matter the odds or the cost. For these warriors, each successful mission brings them one step closer to absolution and the eventual removal of their iron masks, a moment of triumph that few among their ranks will ever know.

Encountering the infernal guard on the battlefield is a harrowing experience, as their foes must face not only the formidable prowess of these elite warriors but also the relentless determination that drives them. The infernal guard will stop at nothing to achieve their objectives and atone for their past failures, and those who stand in their way must be prepared to face the full fury of their wrath.

### Infernal Ironsworn
The infernal ironsworn are the most elite members of the infernal guard, chosen for their unwavering loyalty, exceptional combat prowess, and unyielding devotion to the cause of their dark masters. Handpicked from the ranks of the infernal guard, these warriors are entrusted with the sacred duty of serving as personal soldiers and bodyguards for the highest-ranking chaos dwarves, including sorcerer-priests, warlords, and other leaders of their dark society.

Throwable blasting charges are a signature weapon of the infernal ironsworn, a testament to the deadly ingenuity of the chaos dwarves. Forged in the dark, magma-filled foundries deep within their subterranean strongholds, these compact and potent explosives combine alchemical prowess with the lethal cunning of their creators. The charges contain a highly volatile concoction of volatile minerals and arcane substances, carefully encased within a rugged iron shell. When hurled at enemies, the blasting charges detonate with devastating force, unleashing a searing wave of flame and shrapnel that can tear through flesh and armor alike.

In their role as protectors of the highest-ranking chaos dwarves, the infernal ironsworn are expected to be ever-vigilant, anticipating and neutralizing any threat to their charges before it can manifest. Their keen senses, honed by years of brutal training and the harsh lessons of their past failures, enable them to detect the subtlest signs of danger, allowing them to react with lightning speed to counter any would-be assassins or saboteurs.

### Overseers

Chaos dwarf overseers are a distinct and influential caste within their dark society, serving as both slave masters and military generals. These cunning and ruthless individuals wield tremendous power and authority, overseeing the vast legions of slaves and lesser chaos dwarves that toil in the name of their malevolent masters.

As slave masters, chaos dwarf overseers are responsible for maintaining order and productivity within the sprawling slave workforce that fuels their dark empire. They are masters of manipulation and control, employing a combination of fear, brutality, and martial prowess to keep their thralls in line. In addition to the physical and psychological torment they inflict upon their captives, overseers use their unyielding authority and presence to ensure the unwavering obedience and submission of their slaves.

In their capacity as military generals, chaos dwarf overseers are tasked with leading the armies of their dark masters into battle. They are shrewd tacticians and skilled commanders, well-versed in the arts of war and the unique capabilities of their diverse troops. From the disciplined ranks of the infernal guard to the rampaging hordes of enslaved creatures, the overseers expertly marshal these forces to achieve their masters' objectives with brutal efficiency.

> ##### Dwarves with Polarms
> Though dwarves in many fantasy settings traditionally use axes in combat, halberds, and other polearms weapons better complement the tactics dwarves use. Otherwise, they are vulnerable to foes who use reach weapons against them. If you wish to give the dwarves more well-rounded tactical options, you can replace their battle axes with halberds and replace their shield fighter trait with the following trait (only do this for dwarves with shields):<Br>
***Halberd Master.***  The dwarf can wield a halberd in one hand and a shield in the other.





### Chaos Dwarf Loot
Because chaos dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Chaos Dwarf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

### Chaos Dwarf Infantry Tactics
Chaos dwarfs are twisted versions of regular dwarves who possess perverted versions of traditional dwarven traits. Dwarven stubbornness has turned to unrelenting hatred, their love of crafting has been channeled into the creation of weapons of destruction, and their pride now causes them to see all others as beneath them. 

Despite these grotesque changes in attitude, the combat tactics of chaos dwarfs differ little from those of their standard kin. They are most effective when occupying a fortified position and using ranged artillery to batter their enemies from afar while their unyielding melee forces hold the line.

One significant difference in combat strategy stems from their reliance on acquiring forced labor, as chaos dwarf society runs on the backs of captured prisoners who are relentlessly worked to death. This means chaos dwarves will not be content to drive an enemy off. If an enemy force flees, and the chaos dwarves believe they have an overwhelming combat advantage, they will chase down their foes to capture them. 

There are two abilities common to all chaos dwarves:

#### Resolute Stance

Dwarves can best use this ability when fighting in confined spaces that don’t require much movement. The optimal scenario involves a mix of ranged and melee dwarf combatants. The ranged dwarves will hunker down behind cover with this ability, making it very difficult to counter them with ranged attacks. They will then have melee dwarfs stand about 5 or 10 feet in front of them to stop anyone who approaches with readied attacks. Dwarves are patient and resilient, so they will tolerate taking fire from enemies this way if it seems like their own ranged attacks are outpacing their enemies’.

If the players bombard chaos dwarves with area-of-effect attacks or effects that force saving throws, this may force dwarves out of their defensive position and cause them to charge the players or even flee if they’ve taken heavy damage. Though, many chaos dwarves can resist common damage types such as poison and fire, which may allow them to better endure such abilities.

When dwarves use this ability, be sure to communicate it to the players. You can say something to the effect of “the dwarf plants his feet firmly and stares you down, ready for anything that comes at him.”

#### Debilitating Strike

The primary purpose of this ability is to allow chaos dwarves to take prisoners of war to serve as forced labor. They will do non-lethal damage when bringing creatures down to 0 hit points, even if they’re fighting a group with a healer. 

#### Chaos Dwarf Warriors

Chaos Dwarf warriors act as the frontline in battle. When part of a well-balanced army, they generally use the standard chaos dwarf tactics described earlier. However, if they are the only type of soldier on the battlefield, they will take one of two tactics depending on the situation.
* If the enemy can attack from range, the dwarfs charge into melee combat, taking the Dash action if needed to get within range. On their next turn, they will take a Resolute stance and fight, forcing their opponent to either fight them in melee with disadvantage or take an opportunity attack to withdraw.
* If the enemy charges the chaos dwarf warriors, they will merely hold their position with Resolute Stnace and ready attacks for when the enemy comes within reach.

Chaos dwarf warriors prioritize attacking targets they can reach while in a Resolute Stance.

##### Blazing Beard Warriors

When blazing beards are on fire, their attacks deal more damage. Moreover, when they attack an enemy that is already on fire, it causes even more damage. Their main priority is to set as many enemies and other blazing beards on fire. There are several ways to achieve this, including:
* If a blazing beard is moving towards an enemy and can't quite reach them, they can throw a naphtha bomb that hits the enemy and themselves on the opposite edge of the blast radius.
* If a blazing beard is in a resolute stance and doesn't want to move, it may use its naphtha bomb as described above.
* Running into a group of creatures using their burning resolve ability is also quite effective.

#### Infernal Guards
Infernal guards are just a stronger version of chaos dwarf warriors, with the only mechanical difference being that their attacks made with advantage hit even harder. Their tactics are essentially the same as normal chaos dwarf warriors. 

#### Infernal Ironsworn
The main difference between infernal ironsworn and other chaos dwarf infantry is their blasting charges. They will usually use their blasting charges when they are being charged, when charging toward an enemy, or if they can hit three or more targets. However, there are two things they must watch out for:

* Enemies within their reach can interrupt the grenade and cause it to detonate on top of the dwarf.
* When throwing the grenade, the dwarf must consider that other dwarves may be hit by the blast. Some dwarves are resistant to fire or outright immune in the case of the infernal ironguard. However, if dwarves caught in the blast are in a resolute stance, they will have disadvantage on the saving throw and likely take the full piercing damage from the blast. Depending on the circumstances, the infernal ironsworn may still opt to use the bombs even if they hit allies.

##### The Immortals
The signature ability of The Immortals is their Undying Will. It's important to note that they start the fight with extra temporary hit points granted by this ability. The Immortals typically begin the fight clustered together and try to bait out area-of-effect spells from the enemy, hoping that it won't deal enough damage to break their Undying Will, and they'll simply regain their lost temporary hit points. They may avoid this tactic if they know the enemy has area-of-effect spells that deal damage other than fire. Once The Immortals have spread out, they use their Undying Will to keep themselves safe while moving into prime positions. They prefer to fight one-on-one, as facing multiple enemies poses a greater risk of damage overcoming their Undying Will.

#### Chaos Dwarf Overseers
Chaos dwarf overseers can make their allies more aggressive. They are most effective when the overseer has a mix of cheap expendable units, such as forced laborers and more elite dwarves and warriors.

##### Brutal Motivation
The overseer can use one of his attacks to kill one of his laborers to activate this ability. As long as at least two of his dwarves benefit from it, he will consider it a worthwhile tradeoff. The overseer can also trigger the ability by reducing an enemy to zero hit points, but this is a risky move and should only be done if he’s sure to bring the enemy down.

##### Harsh Discipline
The overseer sends non-dwarf laborers to slow down the enemy before using this ability on his dwarves and any laborers within range. This allows the laborers to better hold their ground and the dwarves to march forward and fight more effectively.

#### Dwarves With Polearms
The variant rule that allows dwarves to use halberds does not change their tactics but improves the already listed tactics, as having reach enables them to use their Resolute Stance more frequently. If you’re using this rule, keep in mind that it does remove the dwarves’ weakness to reach weapons. This is a more realistic tactical choice on their part, but it also gives players few options to counter them.
