### Chaos Dwarf Warriors

These soldiers are the mainstay of their armies, displaying unwavering loyalty and fierce determination in battle. They are often found on the front lines of chaos dwarf forces, ready to face any foe with their cruel battleaxes and sturdy shields. The ring mail they don provides ample protection, while their shields are adorned with dread symbols of their dark allegiance. Like the warriors of their uncorrupted kin, they combine these masterfully crafted armaments with unyielding discipline to become a fighting force to be reckoned with.

Despite being among the lowest-ranking dwarven soldiers in their armies, compared to the warriors of other races, these chaos dwarves are still elite infantry. However, their combat prowess is offset by the relatively small population of their race. As such, chaos dwarf warriors cannot be fielded in the same numbers as warriors of other races and must often rely on a mass fodder force of indentured soldiers to fill out their numbers. Because of this constant need for more cannon fodder, chaos dwarf warriors often engage in raids to capture and conscript new soldiers for their army.

***Blazing Bear Warriors.*** These fiery warriors are a rare and fearsome sect of battle-hardened fighters who have delved deep into the secrets of flame, harnessing its destructive power to rain havoc upon their enemies. They are easily recognized by their brass armaments and flaming hair and beards. The blazing beards are specialized warriors often found in the ranks of the more ruthless and aggressive dwarf factions, using their mastery of flame to demoralize and devastate their foes.

Their prowess in battle is exemplified by their flaming battleaxes, which emit a searing heat that intensifies when either their target or the warrior is engulfed in flames. This fearsome power can turn the tide of battle as their foes are consumed by the relentless inferno.

When blazing beard warriors are able to focus their fury in combat, it manifests as a surge of intense heat that erupts from their very being, igniting any who dare approach. The resulting firestorm serves as a potent deterrent to those who would dare to approach these formidable warriors.

Staying out of range of their attacks proves futile, for most of these dwarves are armed with sinister incendiary devices, which they hurl into crowds of enemies unleashing a devastating inferno that can turn the tide of battle in an instant.

### Infernal Guard

The warriors represent an elite cadre of chaos dwarf soldiers, handpicked from the ranks of their brethren to serve as the vanguard of their dark masters. These fearsome warriors are bound together by a shared history of past failures, which they seek to atone for through unwavering loyalty, unmatched ferocity, and the merciless conquest of their enemies. The path of the infernal guard is one of redemption and suffering, as each member dons an iron mask that obscures their visage, a symbol of their shame and a constant reminder of the debts they must repay.

The iron masks serve not only as a sign of their penance but also as a tool of dehumanization, stripping the infernal guard of their individuality and forging them into a single, cohesive unit. Beneath these forbidding masks, the infernal guard finds solace in their shared purpose and the brutal path toward atonement they have been provided. In battle, these masks instill fear in the hearts of their enemies, as they come to understand that they face an adversary that is relentless, unforgiving, and without mercy.

In their quest for redemption, the infernal <br> guard is often tasked with carrying out the most <br> dangerous and brutal missions for their dark masters. From leading daring assaults on heavily fortified strongholds to hunting down powerful adversaries deep within enemy territory, the infernal guard willingly accepts any challenge, no matter the odds or the cost. For these warriors, each successful mission brings them one step closer to absolution and the eventual removal of their iron masks, a moment of triumph that few among their ranks will ever know.

Encountering the infernal guard on the battlefield is a harrowing experience, as their foes must face not only the formidable prowess of these elite warriors but also the relentless determination that drives them. The infernal guard will stop at nothing to achieve their objectives and atone for their past failures, and those who stand in their way must be prepared to face the full fury of their wrath.

### Overseers

Chaos dwarf overseers are a distinct and influential caste within their dark society, serving as both slave masters and military generals. These cunning and ruthless individuals wield tremendous power and authority, overseeing the vast legions of slaves and lesser chaos dwarves that toil in the name of their malevolent masters.

As slave masters, chaos dwarf overseers are responsible for maintaining order and productivity within the sprawling slave workforce that fuels their dark empire. They are masters of manipulation and control, employing a combination of fear, brutality, and martial prowess to keep their thralls in line. In addition to the physical and psychological torment they inflict upon their captives, overseers use their unyielding authority and presence to ensure the unwavering obedience and submission of their slaves.

In their capacity as military generals, chaos dwarf overseers are tasked with leading the armies of their dark masters into battle. They are shrewd tacticians and skilled commanders, well-versed in the arts of war and the unique capabilities of their diverse troops. From the disciplined ranks of the infernal guard to the rampaging hordes of enslaved creatures, the overseers expertly marshal these forces to achieve their masters' objectives with brutal efficiency.

> ##### Dwarves with Polarms
> Though dwarves in many fantasy settings traditionally use axes in combat, halberds, and other polearms weapons better complement the tactics dwarves use. Otherwise, they are vulnerable to foes who use reach weapons against them. If you wish to give the dwarves more well-rounded tactical options, you can replace their battle axes with halberds and replace their shield fighter trait with the following trait (only do this for dwarves with shields):<Br>
***Halberd Master.***  The dwarf can wield a halberd in one hand and a shield in the other.





### Chaos Dwarf Loot
Because chaos dwarves are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Chaos Dwarf Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
