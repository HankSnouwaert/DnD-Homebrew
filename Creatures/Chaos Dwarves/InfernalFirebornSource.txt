## Infernal Fireborn
*Burning Demon Souls Bound To Servitude*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Mountain, Underdark, <br> Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>


Fel dwarves possess an insatiable hunger for power <br> and a ferocious hatred for all beyond their own kind. <br> These traits have driven them to place no trust in, nor offer loyalty to, any being save themselves and their great and terrible gods—whom they follow only in the hope of stealing or coveting some portion of their blasphemous power.

So intense is the urge to dominate that burns within a fel dwarf’s black heart, the notion of serving another fiendish creature is both repugnant and insufferable. Thus, the deamonsmiths of their kind have spent lifetimes delving into the depths of sorcery and science, devising methods to bind and break hellish entities to their will. From this tireless research, the fireborn were brought into existence.

These living weapons of war are forged by fusing a bound demonic spirit into a volatile mixture of molten magma and the boiling blood of sacrificial victims. This unholy compound is then poured into cold bronze suits of armor, etched with countless incantations of binding. The result is a machine given a sinister semblance of life, its formidable abilities fueled by the demonic fire trapped within. The metal of an infernal fireborn glows with an otherworldly light, superheated by the spirit’s fury, and scorches the ground beneath its feet. Armed with searing weapons chained to their very forms, even a small band of fireborn can carve through enemy ranks without pause or fear, obeying every sadistic command of their cruel creators.

Yet for all the fel dwarves' devilish ingenuity, the demonic spirit animating these constructs is far from a stable power source. The imprisoned essence constantly seeks escape. When a fireborn suffers sufficient damage to its frame, the demon within begins tearing its way free, unraveling the construct from the inside. Rebellious flames burst through softened plates, erupting into the open as volcanic rock crumbles to the earth.

Despite this flaw, fireborn are usually able to win the day for their fel dwarf masters before collapsing. Their remains are then swiftly recovered, so that another wicked spirit may be shackled for the next campaign of conquest.

### Infernal Fireborn Tactics
Due to their Burning Bright trait, infernal fireborn function best as hard-hitting shock troopers—overwhelming enemies quickly before their power begins to wane. Their Blazing Body trait makes them most effective when targeting large groups of enemies.

##### Infernal Fireborn Adventure Hooks
| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | **The Broken Frame:** A shattered infernal fireborn lies dormant in a battlefield-turned-graveyard, its armor split open and cold. Recently, scavengers who touched it have gone missing, and strange embers now rise from the wreckage each night. The party is hired to investigate—but the spirit within may not be as dormant as it seems.|
|  2  |**The Blazing Fugitive:** A single fireborn has broken free of its bindings and fled its masters. Now roaming the countryside in a mindless rage, it leaves trails of scorched earth and vaporized militia. The party is sent to destroy or subdue the rogue construct—but others seek to capture it and study how it resisted its creators.  |
|  3  | **The Chains That Burn:** A local noble has secretly acquired an Infernal Fireborn as a trophy. Bound by stolen rituals, it now guards his vault. But the binding is failing, and the party is hired to retrieve a relic locked inside—before the fireborn breaks loose and reduces the manor to molten ruin.|
|  4  |**The Ash March:** A column of fireborn is moving across the wastes without any visible escort or command. Scholars fear the daemonsmith who built them is dead—and that the constructs are now following their last order: to burn everything in their path. The party must find a way to stop or divert the march before it reaches a major settlement.  |

### Infernal Fireborn Loot
Because infernal destroyers are constructs, most of the valuable goods that can be looted from them are materials salvaged from their remains. Salvaged material can be gathered using an Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (Smith’s Tolls), or Intelligence (Tinker’s Tools) check.

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

##### Infernal Fireborn Loot (Avg. 66gp)

| Looting Check Result <br> or 1d20 + 5 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 2d6(7) 5gp Items (35gp) |
|  8-10 | 2d4(5) 10gp Items (50gp) | 
|  11-17 | 2d6(7) 10gp Items (70gp) |  
|  18-22 | 1d6(3) 20gp Items (60gp)  |  
|  23+ |  2d4(5) 20gp Items (100gp) |  

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 10gp Metal item could be Fireborn Scrap, a 5gp version might be Worn Fireborn Scrap, and a 20gp version could be Masterwork Fireborn Scrap.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. 

Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Infernal Fireborn Materials: 10gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Essense|  Demonic Vapors (Mild/Strong) | 
| 2-4   | Metal|  Fireborn Scrap (Worn/Masterwork) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use these creatures’ loot for crafting magic items, consult the Magic Themes table for thematic suggestions. The **Magic Theme** column helps align the crafted item’s effects with the creature’s nature, while the **Example Descriptor** suggests how to describe the loot's magical quality. Magic loot can span one or multiple themes.
 
For example, Fiendish magic item effects might drain the life of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Random Magic Ingredients.***
To introduce randomness to how often magic loot is found, roll a percentile die along with the normal loot roll to see if magic loot is found. There's a suggested probability at the top of the table.

##### Infernal Fireborn Magic Themes 
**Suggested Chance of Finding Magic Loot: 75%**
|1d4 | Magic Theme | Example Descriptor | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1-2   | Fiendish| Hellish| 
| 3-4  | Fire | Searing|  


***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.
