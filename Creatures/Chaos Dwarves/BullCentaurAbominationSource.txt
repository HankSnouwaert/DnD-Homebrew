## Bull Centaur Abominations
*Unholy Fusions of Dwarf, Bull, & Iron*<br>
**Habitat:** Desert, Grasslands, Mountain, Underdark, Urban, Volcanic; **Treasure:** Armaments <br>

Many daemonsmiths devise their own twisted methods to create bull centaurs when their numbers are too few to serve the needs of their malevolent plots. Yet the most ambitious among the fel artificers are never satisfied. They continue to subject these creatures to horrific experiments in pursuit of greater power.

The rare few that survive such brutal trials are known as abominations. Their hides are fused with metal, etched with hellish runes, and the blood of countless unholy creatures courses through their veins.

Infernal spearguns replace their hands—used to impale any who draw near or to launch burning projectiles at distant foes. Their hooves strike with such fury that they shatter the earth and ignite the very air, leaving rubble and broken bodies scattered about them.

### Bull Centaur Abomination Tactics
The abomination uses Cataclysmic Slam as soon as it can hit two or more targets. It prioritizes using Infernal Skewer against enemies who are Paralyzed or Frightened.

### Bull Centaur Abomination Loot
Most of the valuable goods that can be looted from bull centaurs are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most dropped or hidden valuables can be found using **Intelligence (Investigation)** or **Wisdom (Perception)** checks. 

Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

##### Bull Centaur Abomination Loot Table  (Avg. 1,250gp)


| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 7 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-9  | 1 500gp Items |
|  10-14 | 1d4(2) 500gp Items | 
|  15-21 | 1 1,000gp Items  |  
|  22-25 | 1d4(2) 1,000gp Items |  
|  26+ |  1 2,000gp Items |  

#### Optional: Describing Looted Materials
If you’re not interested in the specifics, simply say the party collected materials worth the rolled gp value. If you want more detail, the tables below suggest materials for different gp values by creature. They also provide **Example Names** and **Quality Descriptors** for items worth **half** or **twice** the table's gp value.

For example, a 1,000gp Bone item from a bull centaur could be a Abominable Centaur Horn, a 500gp version might be a Damaged Abominable Centaur Horn, and a 2,000gp version could be an Enhanced Abominable Centaur Horn.

***When To Use Descriptions.*** You can describe these items during looting, when selling them, or when crafting, but it's best not to make players track long descriptive names. Only use as much detail as is needed when needed.

##### Bull Centaur Abomination Materials: 1,000gp 

|1d4 | Material | Example Name (Quality Descriptors) | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1   | Bone|   Abominable Centaur Horn (Damaged/Enhanced) | 
| 2   | Jewelry | Fire Opal (Damaged/Flawless)|  
| 3-4   | Metal|  Abominable Centaur Plating (Damaged/Masterwork) |  

#### Optional: Magic Loot for Item Crafting
If you plan to use harvested loot for crafting magic items, you can try to thematically align the effects of the magic items being crafted with the creature's they're harvested from. In the case of bull centaurs, Fiendish effects would make the most sense. These could be magic item effects that steal the lives of their victims or conjure unholy magic.

***Magic Loot GP Values.*** The value of magic ingredients depends on your crafting system. Subtract their cost from the normal loot’s gp value. If the ingredient is worth significantly more, subtract it from the next treasure hoard instead.

\columnbreak

> ##### New Condition: Resolute
> The creature stubbornly digs in to weather any assault. It experiences the following effects:
> * Attack rolls made against the creature have disadvantage.
> * The creature can't take its move action on its turn.
> * The creature makes Strength checks and all saving throws with advantage, except Dexterity saving throws, which it makes with disadvantage.
The Resolute condition ends if an effect moves the creature against its will, knocks it prone, or the creature becomes charmed, frightened, or incapacitated. A creature that is prone, charmed, frightened, or incapacitated can't become Resolute.
