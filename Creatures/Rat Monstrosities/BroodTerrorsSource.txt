## Brood Terrors

These monstrous rodents are thought to have once been giant rats subjected to twisted, mutating forces shortly after birth. Their mutations grant them regenerative powers and rapid growth, which drives a ravenous hunger, leading the brood terror to devour all its litter mates and quickly grow beyond the size of a typical giant rat.

A fully grown brood terror is a ravenous monster whose bloated body belies its incredible speed, which it uses to run down prey and rip them apart with disease-ridden fangs. Subterranean races prize brood terrors as deadly mounts. But, riding one is a dangerous proposition, for even if the brood terror doesn't devour its rider, should it be slain in combat, it will explode in a mass of poisonous filth deadly to enemy and ally alike.

Brood terrors are subject to various mutations that make them even more terrifying. Some may exhale cones of noxious gas that can infect their victims with deadly diseases, while others might grow whip-like tails that grapple and pull in their prey. Whether these mutations are unnatural adaptations to extreme environments or the result of deranged experiments is anyone's guess. 

### Brood Terror Tactics

Without guidance, brood terrors don't display sophisticated tactics. However, they become fearless and berserk as they near death and instinctively try to position themselves near <br> as many foes as possible for their death burst.

> ___
>
> ***Blood-Crazed.*** When the brood terror hits a creature with its bite attack and deals damage, the brood terror goes berserk for the next minute. While berserk this way, it can make a bite attack as a bonus action, and attack rolls against it have advantage. 
>
> ***Crevice Crawler.***  The brood terror can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing.
>
> ***Death Burst*** When the brood terror dies, it explodes in a burst of poisonous filth. Each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 21 (6d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
>
> ***Keen Smell.*** The brood terror has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
>
> ***Overwhelming Mass (4).*** The first time each turn that the brood terror hits a creature with an attack, it deals an extra 4 damage per ally it has within 5 feet of its target that isn't incapacitated. The brood terror can benefit from up to 3 allies this way.
>
> ***Regeneration.*** The brood terror regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.  If the brood terror takes acid or fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the brood terror's next turn.
>
> ### Actions
> ***Multiattack.*** The brood terror makes two attacks, one with it's claws and then one with it's bite. 
>
> ***Bite.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 21 (6d4 + 6) piercing damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. At the end of its turn, each creature bitten by the brood terror must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. A creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if it was bitten more than once during the turn. The diseased creature is poisoned and berserk. Every hour, the diseased creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 10 (3d6) on a failure, and ending the disease on a success. The creature dies if this disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This hit point reduction lasts until the disease is cured.
>
> ***Claw.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.

### Brood Terror Mutations
If you wish to create a brood terror with added capabilities, you can apply one or more mutations from the Brood Terror Mutations table.  For each mutation you apply, increase the brood terror's CR by 1.

##### Brood Terror Mutations
| d4  | Mutation |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Pestilent Breath.*** *(Recharges on a Short or Long Rest)* As an action, or as a bonus action while Berserk, the brood terror exhales decay in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or take 21 (4d6) necrotic damage and contract a disease of the brood terror's bite. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn't contract the disease.|
|  2  | ***Lash Tail.***  The brood terror gains a tail attack, which can be used as part of its Multiattack: *Melee Weapon Attack:* +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. *Hit:* 11 (1d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 16) and pulled 15 feet toward the brood terror. The brood terror cannot use its tail on another target until the grapple ends.|
|  3  | ***Cancerous Carapace.*** *(3/Short or Long Rest)* Whenever the brood terror regains hit points from its Regeneration feature, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws for the next minute. This effect can stack up to three times.
|  4  | ***Warp Claws.*** When the brood terror hits a creature with its claws, the target suffers a Warp Wound for the next minute. Each Warp Wound reduces the creature’s AC by 1 and imposes a -1 penalty to all Constitution saving throws. This effect cannot reduce a creature's AC below 1. 


### Brood Terrors in Your Adventures

##### Brood Terror Adventures

| d4  | Plot Hook |

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
> * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.

### Brood Terror Loot
The valuable items looted from brood terrors will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Brood Terror Loot Table
The following table describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

##### Brood Terror Loot Table 

| Looting Check Result or 1d20 + 3 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1 50gp Items |
|  8-12 | 1d4(2) 50gp Items | 
|  13-18 | 1d4(2) 100gp Items  |  
|  19-23 | 1d6(3) 100gp Items  |  
|  24+ |  1d4(2) 200gp Items |  



#### Example Brood Terror Loot Names
You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following tables provide example names.

##### Example Brood Terror Item Names
|1d4 | 5sp Item | 1gp Item | 12p Item | 
|:--:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| 1 <br> (Bone)  | Fractured Brood Terror Bone |   Brood Terror Bone |  Prime Brood Terror Bone  |
