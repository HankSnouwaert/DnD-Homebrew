## Rat Ogres

These aptly named monstrosities combine the brutish physique of an ogre with rat-like features and agility.  Rat ogres scurry at a speed that belies their hulking forms and can dodge incoming attacks with rodential dexterity before ripping apart their foes with giant's strength.  

For all their physical prowess, rat ogres are incredibly simple and weak-willed.  Without a master directing their actions, they operate only on a level of base instinct.  These directionless rat ogres may mindlessly rampage towards anything that catches their attention or aimlessly wander in confused circles, unable to make any sense of their surroundings.

Rat ogres are unnatural creatures that don't typically arise in the wild and are instead engineered to be brutal minions and beasts of war.  Mad mages and flesh smiths, particularly those of subterranean races, will combine mutating magic and twisted biological engineering to craft these murderous brutes. This process allows the rat ogre's creator to endow it with custom features to enhance its combat capabilities, meaning there are no guarantees as to what combination of abilities one will be up against when facing one of these customized monsters.

### Rat Ogre Bone Crushers

Rat ogre bone crushers are a more formidable variant of the standard rat ogres, specifically bred for increased size and strength. Their muscular upper bodies are so large that they walk on all fours, which suits their primary roles of hauling heavy war machinery and serving as mounts for elite ratfolk. For mounting, a wooden platform is strapped to their massive shoulders, allowing riders to command from above.

These hulking creatures are not just beasts of burden but also symbols of power and prestige among ratfolk. Used in battle, they can crush defenses and lead charges, making them key assets in warfare. Off the battlefield, they signify the high status of their riders, often decorated to reflect this importance. Despite their simple minds, Rat Ogre Bone Crushers are highly valued for their strength and imposing presence in ratfolk society.

### Rat Ogre Mutants
Rat ogre mutants are transformed into gigantic beings by the mystic energies of hexstone. This process, involving both exposure to hexstone radiation and the embedding of its shards, significantly amplifies their strength and size. These mutants exhibit enhanced capabilities like remarkable regeneration, increased speed, or intensified aggression, their forms marked by glowing hexstone veins.

Revered and feared in ratfolk society, these mutants serve as formidable weapons on the battlefield, where their massive stature and power can decisively impact wars. However, their volatile nature, fueled by hexstone, makes them challenging to control. Ratfolk commanders and beast masters must use potent magic or coercion to harness these mutants, navigating the fine line between leveraging their might and mitigating the risks they pose.



### Rat Ogre Storm Hellions


Rat ogre storm hellions, the pinnacle of rat ogre evolution, result from the dangerous union of ratfolk eldritch engineering and arcane sorcery. These giants harness eldritch energy, releasing it as devastating arcane storms, thanks to devices implanted by ratfolk engineers. The creation of a Storm Hellion is exceedingly rare and perilous, requiring precise coordination between engineers and sorcerers to manage the creature's immense power.

In combat, storm hellions unleash destructive electrical storms, decimating enemy ranks and altering the course of battles with their fearsome power. Deployed only in critical conflicts due to the risks they pose, their legendary status and formidable abilities make them a symbol of ultimate power and a harbinger of doom on the battlefield.

### Rat Ogre Mutations
If you wish to create a rat ogre with added capabilities, you can apply one or more mutations from the Rat Ogre Mutations table.  For each mutation you apply, increase the rat ogre's CR by 1.

##### Rat Ogre Mutations
| d4  | Mutation |

If the rat ogre has one or more storm charges, it loses a number of storm charges equal to the spell's level, and the creature casting the spell must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 2 (1d4) lightning damage for each charge removed this way on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

>
> ***Hex Tempest (5/Day).*** The rat ogre slams the ground, creating an electrical tempest in a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within 15 feet of it. This tempest lasts for 1 minute and spreads around corners, seeping through openings. When the rat ogre uses this ability, it chooses a direction. When the tempest first appears, and at the start of each of the rat ogres turns afterward, it moves 15 feet in the chosen direction. Any creature that has one or more tempests pass through them, or that ends its turn in the area of one or more tempests must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw.

### Rat Ogres in Your Adventures
The following table provides you with some ways you can incorporate these monstrous rats into your adventures. 


##### Rat Ogre Adventures

| d10  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | A group of fleeing ratfolk raiders attempt to lure the player into the underground lair of their rat ogres for an ambush.|
|  2  | A group of wererats attempting to "bulk up" through alchemical means have accidentally mutated themselves into rat ogres. |
|  3  |A mad mage wanting to create flesh golems runs low on choice parts and has to use rat substitutes, resulting in rat ogre minions.   |
|  4  |  A wizard experimenting with muscle growth on rats ends up beaten to death by the rat ogres he created. |
|  5  |A colony of ratfolk have created rat ogre bone crushers as a labor force to dig new territory closer to a surface settlement.   |
|  6  | A ratfolk seeks the players' aid in slaying a rival usurper who rides upon a rat ogre bone crusher. |
|  7  |A wizard hires the players to hunt rogue rat ogre mutants and harvest their hexstone components for further study.   |
|  8  |  The players must thwart a group of mad ratfolk creating a force of mutant rat ogres, with every delay allowing their army to grow further. |
|  9  |After destroying the lab of its creators, a rat ogre storm hellion leads a pack of rat ogres on a mindless crusade of destruction.   |
|  10  |  A dying artificer saves himself by transferring his mind into a rat ogre storm hellion, though it comes at the cost of his sanity. |

### Rat Ogre Tactics
Rat ogres are tormented and unnatural creatures with no tactical awareness or regard for their safety. Without the guidance of a pack master or other intelligent leaders, they mindlessly attack the nearest targets. When commanded by more intelligent masters, they serve as shock cavalry, overwhelming weaker foes with brute force.

\columnbreak



#### Rat Ogre Bone Crusher Tactics
Rat ogre bone crushers are used as mounts by ratfolk chieftains and warlords. Their ability to knock creatures prone with their claws gives their riders a significant advantage in combat. However, their bloodthirsty nature means they cannot retreat, making them recklessly relentless in battle.

#### Rat Ogre Mutant Tactics
Rat ogre mutants possess a Sweep attack that allows them to deal significant damage to clusters of enemies. If guided by more intelligent creatures, these mutants are directed toward groups to maximize their destructive potential.

#### The Storm Hellion Tactics
When guided by intelligent beings, The Storm Hellion targets spellcasters who can prevent it from gaining storm charges. It seeks opportunities to hit two or more targets with its Hex Tempest ability, turning the battlefield into a deadly maze of storms for opponents. The Hellion prioritizes using its gnash ability to build storm charges, resorting to Hex Tempest only when it can affect three or more targets.

### Rat Ogre Loot
The valuable items looted from rat ogres will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Rat Ogre Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
