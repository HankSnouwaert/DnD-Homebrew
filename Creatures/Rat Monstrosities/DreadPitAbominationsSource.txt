## Dread Pit Abominations
These unholy horrors appear to be an amalgam of a wyrm and a monstrous rat, with an assortment of extra limbs and mouths haphazardly grafted across its body.  Dread pit abominations are such a horrendously chaotic mess of arms and teeth that no two look alike.  They all possess gargantuan bodies that are vaguely draconic in shape but sport grotesquely rat-like features.  

Because of the unique circumstances involved in the creation of any dread pit abomination, the specifics of their appearance can vary wildly, with some looking akin to horrific flesh golems and others appearing to be eldritch horrors from another dimension.  

***Erratic Actions.*** The behavior of dread pit abominations is difficult to predict in combat because their bodies operate in such an unnatural and erratic manner.  One moment the abomination's limbs may work against each other, causing it to barely keep pace with an average human, and the next moment it will gallop across the battlefield at breakneck speeds.

The abomination's attack patterns are similarly unpredictable.  The monster has an assortment of flailing limbs it can use to pummel foes, but if it is gripped with maddening hunger, it may suddenly lash out with its many slavering mouths.  Other times, the abomination's appendages are occupied with twitching spasms, so it settles for throwing its massive girth against every creature in range.

***Undying Horror.*** The unholy energies that lead to the dread pit abomination's creation also make it exceptionally difficult to slay.  Not only do these monsters regenerate at a rapid pace, but their deaths by no means guarantee an end to their terror. 


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some slain abominations unleash one final burst of eldritch lightning to take their foes down with them, while others are host to massive swarms of bloodthirsty rats which burst from their corpse to devour everything in their path.  Still, others refuse to die altogether and surge back to life to continue the battle against their would-be slayers. 

***Unnatural Origin.*** Dread pit abominations aren't born naturally but are the product of twisted, mutagenic magic.  They are most often the result of a wicked, arcane experiment, akin to the creation of a flesh golem, but on a more massive scale.  These monstrosities are crafted from pieces of huge draconic creatures fused with giant rats.  

Other dread pit abominations may have differing origins.  One may be a giant rat subjected to ancient eldritch rituals that turned it into a conduit for the powers of the Far Realm, while another may have once been a primordial rodent monster sleeping underground only to be awoken by the mutating effects of magical radiation.

***Renegades and Warbeasts.*** The sheer power of a dread pit abomination combined with its erratic nature makes it very difficult to control.  Even abominations purposefully created to serve often break free and unleash their own unpredictable rampages.  These free abominations travel to the most abundant food sources they can find and wreak havoc along the way.  They prefer the taste of humanoid flesh and often attack large groups of travelers, villages, and even large cities.  

As terrifying as rogue dread pit abominations are, the most dangerous of their kind are those being directed by intelligent masters.  These monsters combine overwhelming strength with strategic purpose and can serve a range of purposes, from mighty war beast to lair guardian.

***Mutagenic Variants.*** Dread pit abominations may exhibit a range of terrifying mutations. Some may possess accelerated regeneration, allowing them to heal wounds swiftly. Others become lumbering behemoths with increased strength and resilience, or develop fluid-injected veins that give them bursts of frenzied energy. A few have backup organs that kick in to prevent them from dying, making them nearly unkillable. These mutations enhance their already formidable natural abilities, turning them into truly nightmarish opponents.

\columnbreak

***The Abomination Thing.*** Among the dread pit abominations, one legendary creature stands out: The Abomination Thing. Exposed to immense quantities of arcane energy, this abomination has superpowered capabilities far exceeding those of its kin and can erratically release devastating blasts of eldritch energy, wreaking havoc in unpredictable and catastrophic ways. The Abomination Thing's presence is marked by the eldritch radiation that follows in its wake, a testament to the raw, chaotic power it wields.

### Dread Pit Abomination Mutations
If you wish to create a dread pit abomination with added capabilities, you can apply one or more mutations from the Dread Pit Abomination table.  For each mutation you apply, increase the dread pit abomination's CR by 1.

##### Dread Pit Abomination Mutations
| d4  | Mutation |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Accelerated Regeneration.***  The abomination regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn, instead of 10, due to its Regeneration ability.
|  2  | ***Lumbering Behemoth.***  The abomination adds an additional 1d6 to its Shambling Horror speed boost. Additionally, if the abomination moves at least 20 feet in a straight line before using its Erratic Attack, the first time a creature is hit by an attack from that action, that creature must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the save fails by 5 or more (DC 15), the creature can't stand up until the end of its next turn. (NOTE: End of who's next turn?)
|  3  | ***Fluid Injected.*** At the start of its turn, the abomination rolls a d4, or 2d4 if it has less than half its hit points. If it rolls a 4 on either die, it can take the Dash action or its Erratic Attack action as a bonus action during its turn.|
|  4  | ***Backup Organs.*** The abomination may roll an additional d6 when rolling for its Too Horrible To Die ability and choose which die to use. Once this feature is used, it cannot be used again until the start of its next turn.

This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
