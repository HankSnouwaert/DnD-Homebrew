## Wolf Rats

These monstrosities combine the aggression and hunting instincts of wolves with the agility of rats.  Wolf rats roam through the cavernous underground environments and dark forests, always looking for prey to sate their never ending hunger.  No matter how much they eat, they appear malnourished, and they attack any potential meal as though their life depends on it.  

***Unnatural Origins.*** Like owlbears, wolf rats are bizarre hybridized creatures of mysterious origin.  Some claim they are simply one of the many horrors to emerge from the beneath the earth.  Others believe they were magically engineered as hunting beasts.  If this is the case, they have proven to be unruly and difficult to train.  Wolf rats generally prefer hunting humanoids over taking orders from them.

If the attack hits, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. A creature knocked prone this way cannot stand up until the end of the wolf rat's next turn unless it uses all of its movement to stand up.

&emsp;***Trained Wolf Rats.*** Those few beast masters who've managed to break them have found wolf rats to be terrifyingly effective at running down and ripping apart soft targets trying to stay out of harm's way. A tamed wolf rat, though rare, can display a fiercely protective loyalty, rivaling even the most devoted guard dogs. They will viciously defend their handler from threats, often preemptively attacking anything they perceive as a potential danger. Their protective nature combines with their innate aggression to create a formidable ally, albeit one that requires careful handling.

***Mutated Wolf Rats.*** The mutations of wolf rats vary greatly, adding to their fearsome reputation. Some possess acidic saliva that can burn through armor and flesh alike, while others host necroparasites, enabling them to withstand lethal blows only to rise again. Bloated variants explode upon death, drenching nearby foes in corrosive bile, and rabid strains can spread a virulent disease with their bites. These mutations not only make wolf rats unpredictable but also ensure that they are a constant source of fear for those who encounter them in the wild or, more terrifyingly, under the command of a skilled beast master.

### Wolf Rat Mutations
If you wish to create a wolf rat with added capabilities, you can apply one or more mutations from the Wolf Rat Mutations table.  For each mutation you apply, increase the wolf rat's CR by 1.

##### Wolf Rat Mutations
| d4  | Mutation |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Acidic Saliva.*** When the wolf rat hits a creature with an attack, the target is covered in acid. This acid remains until the target or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. At the end of each of its turns, if a creature is covered in this acid, it takes 5 (2d4) acid damage. Additionally, any armor worn by the creature suffers a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the Armor Class (AC) it provides. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or less is destroyed.
|  2  | ***Necroparasites.***  If the wolf rat is reduced to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a successful save, the wolf rat drops to 1 hit point instead.|
|  3  | ***Bloated.*** When the wolf rat dies, it explodes, releasing a burst of bile. Each creature within 10 feet of the wolf rat must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 11 (3d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful save.
|  4  | ***Rabid.*** At the end of its turn, each creature bitten by the wolf rat must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. A creature has disadvantage on this saving throw if it was bitten more than once during the turn. The diseased creature is poisoned and berserk. Every hour, the diseased creature must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 2 (1d4) on a failure, and ending the disease on a success. The creature dies if this disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This hit point reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

### Wolf Rats in Your Adventures
The following table provides you with some ways you can incorporate these monstrous rats into your adventures. 


##### Wolf Rat Adventures

| d4  | Plot Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
| 1  | An underground crime ring takes bets on the survival rate of captives who are released into a tunnel complex to be hunted by rat wolves.|
|  2  | Typically reclusive woodland folk flee from the wilds to walled towns, claiming their forests have suddenly been overrun by wolf rats. |
| 3  | The players stumble upon the wreckage of a city destroyed by some magical calamity with packs of mutant wolf rats roaming through the ruins.|
|  4  | A wizard attempting to make a name for herself by combining different types of animals accidentally unleashes a horde of wolf rats upon the world.|

### Wolf Rat Tactics
Wolf rats are vicious creatures with little regard for their own safety and act as glass cannons. They excel at moving swiftly through tight tunnels, attacking any creature that shows the slightest sign of vulnerability. The speed of these attacks help them overwhelm their opponents before any response can be formulated.

#### Trained Wolf Rat Tactics
Trained wolf rats are significantly more durable than their regular counterparts. This variant synergizes well with other strong melee ratfolk, such as chieftains, warlords, or pack masters, enhancing the effectiveness of their group combat tactics.

### Wolf Rat Loot
The valuable items looted from wolf rats will generally come from whatever can be harvested from them. This harvesting can usually be done using a **Wisdom (Survival)** or **Intelligence (Nature)** check. However, you may allow players proficient with specific tools to harvest items related to that tool. For example, a character might make a Wisdom (Leathworker’s Tools) check to harvest hide. 
Alternatively, you can roll for the loot randomly using a flat modifier.

#### Wolf Rats Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check or the results of your roll. If they're making checks, you can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.
