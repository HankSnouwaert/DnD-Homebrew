# Monstrous Rats
The following creatures have forms <br> and traits associated with rats found <br> in nature, but nothing is natural about <br> any of these monstrosities.  They may <br> have once been wild creatures twisted <br> into abominations, or they may have <br> entirely magical origins.  They may <br> be isolated cases of monstrous rats or associated <br> with a larger force of rat-like creatures.  In any case, <br> they are certain to terrorize any would-be adventures unfortunate enough to cross their path.

## Brood Horrors
These monstrous rodents are thought to have once <br> been giant rats subjected to twisted, mutating forces <br> shortly after birth.  Their mutations grant them <br> regenerative powers and rapid growth, which drives a ravenous hunger, leading the brood horror to devour <br> all its litter mates and quickly grow beyond the size <br> of a typical giant rat.  

A fully grown brood horror is a ravenous monster <br> whose bloated body belies its incredible speed, <br> which it uses to run down prey before snatching <br> them up with its whip-like tail.  Subterranean races <br> prize brood horrors as deadly mounts.  But, riding <br> one is a dangerous proposition, for even if the brood <br> horror doesn't devour its rider, should it be slain in <br> combat, it will explode in a mass of poisonous filth <br> deadly to enemy and ally alike.

## Hell Pit Abominations
These unholy horrors appear to be an amalgam of a wyrm and a monstrous rat, with an assortment of extra limbs and mouths haphazardly grafted across its body.  Hell pit abominations are such a horrendously chaotic mess of arms and teeth that no two look alike.  They all possess gargantuan bodies that are vaguely draconic in shape but sport grotesquely rat-like features.  

Because of the unique circumstances involved in the creation of any hell pit abomination, the specifics of their appearance can vary wildly, with some looking akin to horrific flesh golems and others appearing to be eldritch horrors from another dimension.  

***Erratic Actions.*** The behavior of hell pit abominations is difficult to predict in combat because their bodies operate in such an unnatural and erratic manner.  One moment the abomination's limbs may work against each other, causing it to barely keep pace with an average human, and the next moment it will gallop across the battlefield at breakneck speeds.

The abomination's attack patterns are similarly unpredictable.  The monster has an assortment of flailing limbs it can use to pummel foes, but if it is gripped with maddening hunger, it may suddenly lash out with its many slavering mouths.  Other times, the abomination's appendages are occupied with twitching spasms, so it settles for throwing its massive girth against every creature in range.

***Undying Horror.*** The unholy energies that lead to the hell pit abomination's creation also make it exceptionally difficult to slay.  Not only do these monsters regenerate at a rapid pace, but their deaths by no means guarantee an end to their terror. 


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Some slain abominations unleash one final burst of eldritch lightning to take their foes down with them, while others are host to massive swarms of bloodthirsty rats which burst from their corpse to devour everything in their path.  Still, others refuse to die altogether and surge back to life to continue the battle against their would-be slayers. 

***Unnatural Origin.*** Hell pit abominations aren't born naturally but are the product of twisted, mutagenic magic.  They are most often the result of a wicked, arcane experiment, akin to the creation of a flesh golem, but on a more massive scale.  These monstrosities are crafted from pieces of huge draconic creatures fused with giant rats.  

Other hell pit abominations may have differing origins.  One may be a giant rat subjected to ancient eldritch rituals that turned it into a conduit for the powers of the Far Realm, while another may have once been a primordial rodent monster sleeping underground only to be awoken by the mutating effects of magical radiation.

***Renegades and Warbeasts.*** The sheer power of a hell pit abomination combined with its erratic nature makes it very difficult to control.  Even abominations purposefully created to serve often break free and unleash their own unpredictable rampages.  These free abominations travel to the most abundant food sources they can find and wreak havoc along the way.  They prefer the taste of humanoid flesh and often attack large groups of travelers, villages, and even large cities.  

As terrifying as rogue hell pit abominations are, the most dangerous of their kind are those being directed by intelligent masters.  These monsters combine overwhelming strength with strategic purpose and can serve a range of purposes, from mighty war beast to lair guardian.

## Rat Ogres

These aptly named monstrosities combine the brutish physique of an ogre with rat-like features and agility.  Rat ogres scurry at a speed that belies their hulking forms and can dodge incoming attacks with rodential dexterity before ripping apart their foes with giant's strength.  

For all their physical prowess, rat ogres are incredibly simple and weak-willed.  Without a master directing their actions, they operate only on a level of base instinct.  These directionless rat ogres may mindlessly rampage towards anything that catches their attention or aimlessly wander in confused circles, unable to make any sense of their surroundings.

Rat ogres are unnatural creatures that don't typically arise in the wild and are instead engineered to be brutal minions and beasts of war.  Mad mages and flesh smiths, particularly those of subterranean races, will combine mutating magic and twisted biological engineering to craft these murderous brutes.   This process allows the rat ogre's creator to endow it with custom features to enhance its combat capabilities, meaning there are no guarantees as to what combination of abilities one will be up against when facing one of these customized monsters.

### Rat Ogre Mutations
If you wish to create a rat ogre with added capabilities, you can apply one or more mutations from the Rat Ogre Mutations table.  For each mutation you apply, increase the rat ogre's CR by 1.

> ***Scurry Away.*** When an enemy the wererat can see ends its turn, the wererat can move up to half its speed away from the creature and become frightened of it until the end of the creature's next turn. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks. While frightened this way, the wererat can only take the dash, disengage, dodge, or hide action. This feature ignores immunity to the frightened condition.
