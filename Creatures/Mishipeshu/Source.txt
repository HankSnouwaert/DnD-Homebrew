# Mishipeshu
The mishipeshu lurks in the great lakes and rivers of the world, stalking through deep waters and shoreline brush. It is a fiendish creature shaped through druidic magic and has the body of a wildcat but with hard fish-like scales in place of fur. It sports two large antlers that it uses to ram its prey and a large razor fin that runs down its back and ends in a serpentine tail sharp enough to slice through steel. Though mishipeshu protect the sanctity of freshwater environments, they do so with a malevolence rivaling any fiend of the lower planes.

***Druidic Asylum.*** Fiends who have thoroughly displeased their masters will sometimes flee to remote locations of the material plane in an attempt to escape their punishment. These desperate cravens will often offer their services to powerful groups or individuals in exchange for protection, and sometimes they will even seek the protection of druidic circles. Most druidic circles will have nothing to do with fiends. However, if the druids are desperate enough, or they already have a disposition towards consorting with the darker forces of nature, they may come to an arrangement with the fiend.  

If the druids are in need of a guardian for a body of fresh water, they will perform a dark, ritualistic transformation on the fiend. This ritual requires water from the River Styx and a bastardized version of the reincarnation spell cast upon the fiend while it is submerged in the waters it is being charged with protecting. This dark baptism results in the fiend being reborn as a mishipeshu bound to the druids who performed the ritual along with the body of water it is charged with protecting.

***Cruel Guardians.*** Though a mishipeshu will faithfully protect its waters and reliably destroy any would-be defilers, its fiendish nature is reflected in the cruelty and malice with which it carries out its duty. A mishipeshu will use any excuse to meet out lethal punishment to intruders. A single fish taken without permission or the accidental spilling of even a drop of harmful substance into its waters will result in the mishipeshu ruthlessly butchering the offenders and anyone with them. Only high-ranking druids or other powerful beings of the natural world can call off a mishipeshu once an intruder is deemed guilty.

***Lingering Greed.*** The fiendish origin of the mishipeshu's former life leaves it with the selfish need to accumulate wealth, despite having no practical use for it. The mishipeshu will rob the corpses of its victims and anyone else who dies within its domain.  

Copper is its favorite material, and it often abhors other metals such as silver or cold iron, depending on the nature of its fiendish origin. It is said that mishipeshu can be placated with large amounts of copper, allowing travelers to pay penance for wrongs committed and buy safe passage through a protected waterway. However, no amount of copper can convince a mishipeshu to turn against the druid conclave it is bound to.

***Reborn in Water.*** A vital factor in a druidic conclave gaining the mishipeshu's loyalty is the promise that if it is destroyed, the mishipeshu can be reborn within the waters of its home. A mishipeshu who has died within the past 10 days can be revived by a druid casting the *reincarnation* spell on a gallon of water from the lake or river in which it was created. If the lake or river it was bound to is defiled or destroyed, the mishipeshu cannot be revived.

***Elder Mishipeshu.*** If a greater fiend undergoes the mishipeshu ritual of transformation, or a mishipeshu earns the blessing of its druidic conclave through generations of service, the result is an elder mishipeshu.  On rare occasions, elder mishipeshu even become the leaders of their druidic conclaves.  These mishipeshu have greater control over their murderous impulses, though their fiendish malevolence remains ever-present. 

<br><br>

Regardless of how these mishipeshu are created, their physical prowess are superior to those of their lesser kin, and they gain the ability to conjure violent storms to aid them in their hunts.  These storms provide cover while stalking prey and can be used to separate groups of trespassers so the mishipeshu can more easily pick off vulnerable targets.

>
>•	Creatures have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws while within the area.

## Mishipeshu River Lord
These mighty fiends are elder mishipeshu who've honed their druidic powers to the point where they've become the undisputed masters of their domain, usually ruling any druidic circles in the area. In addition to being more physically deadly in combat, these mishipeshu can bend their watery environment to their will.   

Mishipeshu river lords make their homes within underwater caves at the bottoms of lakes or rivers. Their layers are usually fully submerged in water or situated in steep rocky environments, making traversal by intruders difficult, if not deadly. Their central chambers are typically littered with the remains and treasures of former intruders. 

The druidic mastery of these mishipeshu allow them to turn their lairs against intruders, and if they believe their lands are being trespassed upon, they can unleash wild storms across their realm to batter their enemies.

#### Lair Actions
When fighting inside its lair, a mishipeshu river lord can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the mishipeshu can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; it can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

* Pools of water within 90 feet of the mishipeshu surge outward in a grasping tide. Any creature on the ground within 20 feet of such a pool must succeed on a DC 17 Strength saving throw or be pulled up to 20 feet into the water and knocked prone. 
 
* The storm described by the mishipeshu's Storm Call ability is summoned at a point within the lair. The mishipeshu doesn't need to concentrate on the effect, which ends on initiative count 20 of the next round.

\columnbreak

* Freezing rain falls all across the lair. Each creature in the lair other than the mishipeshu must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or suffer disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn and lose concentration on any spells or effects it is maintaining concentration on.

#### Regional Effects

The mishipeshu's watery domain is transformed by is control of the elements and might include one or more of the following magical effects: 

* While in its layer, the mishipeshu can cast *control weather* without material components.

* Spells such as *control weather* or similar effects can't change the weather within 5 miles of its layer unless the mishipeshu allows it. 

* As an action, the mishipeshu can cause its reflection in a body of water within its layer to split off from itself. Once split, the reflection can travel up to 5 miles away from the layer but can't leave the water. The image remains split until the mishipeshu chooses to recall it or until it uses this feature again. Although the image is intangible, it looks, sounds, and moves like the mishipeshu. The mishipeshu can sense, speak, and use its telepathy from the image's location as if present at that location. If the image takes any damage, it disappears and is recalled back to the mishipeshu.
