## Terrorshrieks
*Massive Bat-Like Horrors*<br>
**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** None <br>
The dark and forsaken provinces of the world are suffocated by a gloom that clings to and permeates all within its borders. The few villages that remain live in constant fear, as the dead rise and stalk the wilderness, and the vampiric lords and ladies of the land, cruel and bitter, have shed their humanity in ages long past, treating their subjects as cattle to be feasted upon.

Yet even in these grim realms, there exists a terror that eclipses all other monsters: the terrorshriek.

A bat the size of a merchant’s caravan, it flies upon vast wings of black leather. From cavernous lairs hidden deep within the most remote wilderness, terrorshrieks soar for miles in search of prey: livestock, stag, bears, and even other nightmares that inhabit the realm. All are potential victims of a terrorshriek’s hunger.

Upon detecting a potential meal through echolocation, the terrorshriek dives upon its newfound target with alarming speed. Most victims have only seconds to register the twin saber-like fangs, each as long as a claymore, capable of draining a man of blood in a single heartbeat, and outstretched claws strong enough to subdue a full-grown bull.

Worse still is what most hear in their final moments. A shriek, unnatural and vile, that carries with it a heinous power. Those who hear it feel their eyes and ears fill with blood as their very bones shake and creak, vibrating, and some breaking under the strain. Other insidious noises assault the victim as they lie crippled and helpless, sounds that reveal the winged monster’s truly unholy nature.

The few who have survived each tell different accounts of the sounds that overcame them. One man claimed he heard the screams of many women and children, as if they were being torn apart beside him. Another swore he heard whispers pressed against his blood-filled ears, frantic voices muttering in disturbing unison, forming a macabre melody in a dark and alien tongue.

These accounts have led many to believe that the cries of a terrorshriek are echoes from the underworld itself, and that to hear them is to listen to the wailing of the damned. Few living creatures possess the mental or physical fortitude to survive such horrors, let alone muster the courage and strength after such a bombardment to face the hulking beast as it descends upon them.

### Risen Terrorshrieks
The lairs of Terrorshrieks are charnel pits, filled with the drained remnants of their ghastly meals, dragged back so the gluttonous monster may indulge in seclusion. Most creatures avoid such havens of death and decay. Eventually, after decades of spreading mayhem and dread, the beast succumbs to the ravages of time and expires atop its mound of cadavers.

Unfortunately for the world, this is when an even greater evil is born.

It is not uncommon for vampires to discover such tombs. Some legends even claim that the most bestial of vampires share a savage kinship with terrorshrieks and can sense their deaths. When the titanic carcass is found, the most powerful necromancy can be invoked to forge a terrible bond between vampire and terrorshrieks. Ebon magic awakens the beast, igniting its hunger once more. To complete the ritual, the newborn abomination must drink the vampire’s blood.

Thus is created a servant far beyond any common puppet of rotten bone and flesh. These vampiric monstrosities far outstrip their living counterparts in both power and horror. The dark essence coursing through their putrefying innards allows the terrorshriek to recover from devastating blows in moments, as stinking muscle, pox-ridden skin, and blighted bone shift and fuse back into place, even after being shattered and torn apart.

The bony maws and talons of the terrorshriek are encrusted with a lethal toxin, distilled from the gore of its former feasts and twisted by corrupted sorcery. Worse still, the hollow, fetid body of the terrorshrieks attracts swarms of beasts that gather in droves to nest and gnaw upon the unholy behemoth’s viscera. These creatures become utterly beholden to the terrorshriek.

Should the terrorshrieks ever fall in battle, its body will burst open as a black cloud erupts forth, spreading out in search of flesh to which the repugnant vermin may attach their snouts. They tear and feed, siphoning stolen life back to the remains of their slain master, causing the carcass to renew itself once more.

Such malevolent power has made the vampires who've secured these mounts figures of legend and nightmare. In the deep hours of night, shrill keening echoes across the land, traveling for miles and tormenting all who hear its mournful cry. Those who huddle in their homes, charms and herbs hanging from every doorway, praying they may see the light of day, have witnessed a silhouette against the pale moon, withered wings outstretched, tattered bones and glistening organs catching the faint glow of night. Upon its back sits a bestial rider, smiling with dagger-like teeth, its eyes burning coals.

#### Terrorshriek Tactics
Terrorshrieks open combat by rushing toward the largest cluster of enemies and unleashing their Death Shriek. They then focus their attacks on a Paralyzed creature. If no creature is Paralyzed, they instead target one that is Frightened or Dazed, choosing one with low Strength if more than one creature has been affected by the sherik. Once engaged, the terrorshriek Grapples its chosen victim and takes flight, carrying the creature aloft while continuing its assault.

If the terrorshrieks lose its grip on a target, it shifts focus to the creature with the lowest Strength or Constitution.

A risen terrorshriek continues to pursue and attack any creature it has successfully poisoned it.

When a feasting swarm spawns from the corpse of a risen terrorshriek, it moves to attack the creature with the lowest Armor Class, using its movement and attacks to drain vitality and restore the terrorshrieks.
