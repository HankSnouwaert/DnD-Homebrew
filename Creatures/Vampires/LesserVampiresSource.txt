## Vampires
*Blood-Sucking Lords of the Night*<br>

Among the undead that defy the natural order, raised from the grave to plague the living, few outstrip vampires in the power they wield or the danger they pose to the mortal world.

Most undead are mindless killers: shambling zombies or skeletal warriors that either obey the exact instructions of their creators or wander aimlessly, slaying any living thing that crosses their path. Others, like ghosts and banshees, are trapped by past grudges or personal failings from their former lives, locking them into narrow-minded, predictable behavior. They are unable to learn or change as the centuries pass.

Vampires, in deadly contrast, are ambitious creatures. Upon their unholy rebirth, their desires are unfettered. They pursue what they coveted most in life with heartless rapacity, regarding no other being in their single-minded chase. A vampire retains the ability to learn and adapt over time, allowing it to devote lifetimes to mastering any skill needed to overcome adversaries who stand in the way of its cravings. Moreover, a vampire’s supernatural powers grow stronger the older it becomes; the most ancient of their kind are near-godlike in capability, rivaling even the dreaded lich or death knight.

The nature of a vampire can vary drastically from one individual to another, sometimes so greatly that two vampires might not even be recognized as the same type of undead. A great many bloodlines afflict the realms, and a vampire’s own disposition and desires further mold its form over the years.

Some can pass for human, often possessing an unearthly beauty; yet those who look closely will notice skin as pale as a corpse. When their emotions flare or they call upon dark magics, a vampire’s true monstrous nature is laid bare: glistening fangs, crimson eyes that glow in the dark, or other horrific features manifest in these moments of fury. Some have been completely consumed by their feral nature and bear a beastly visage, their humanity all but gone. Others fully embrace their undead state: flesh rotting, wafting a malodor that permeates the air around them; some are little more than grey, dry skin stretched over bone, eyes crumbled to dust, leaving ghastly sockets above a withered, tongueless maw that boasts only protruding fangs.

Beyond appearance, the abilities a vampire possesses are equally unpredictable. Some can entrance mortals with an ensnaring gaze or enslave them with a single bite, compelling their thralls to commit any manner of treasonous act in service to their new master. Others wield the most powerful magics, spells that dredge hordes of long-forgotten undead from the depths of the earth, or hurl bolts of life-draining black energy that ravage foes and leave only withered husks behind. Many can summon swarms of bats to darken the sky or packs of wolves to run down their prey; some can even transform into such beasts themselves and join their children in the hunt.

Yet as powerful as vampires are, each possesses particular weaknesses that vampire hunters and others who seek to destroy these wicked monsters can exploit. Silver burns most vampires on contact, and a blow from a silver weapon may cause them to burst into flame. Running water can erode their flesh;  garlic and certain herbs repel them or make them violently ill. The most common weakness is an aversion  to direct sunlight, which can weaken a vampire or even immolate it outright.

The one trait that binds all vampires is their need to feast on the living blood of mortals. Even newly created vampires possess enough otherworldly strength and speed to wrestle down a victim and drink deep from the nectar in their veins. Such insatiable hunger is the eternal price of their undying existence.

### Vampire Weaknesses
You can apply one or all of the following weaknesses to any of the vampires listed in this document.

* **Forbiddance.** The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from an occupant.
* **Garlic.** Any Vampire that starts its turn within 5 feet of a large amount of garlic must make a DC 15 Constitution save. If it fails, until the end of its next turn, it moves at half speed, can't use its Vampiric Powers, and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
* **Running Water.** The vampire takes 20 Acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
* **Stake to the Heart.** The vampire is destroyed if a weapon that deals Piercing damage is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is Incapacitated.
* **Silvered Weapons.** Whenever the vampire takes damage from a slivered weapon, it takes an additional 1d6 Radiant damage.
* **Sunlight.** The vampire takes 20 Radiant damage if it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.


### Vampire Wretches
Some vampires are so far down the dark hierarchy of their kind that they are but wretches compared to the mightiest lords of night. Though these creatures are far more deadly than a typical human, the extent of their vampiric abilities is limited, and they are easily dispatched by experienced hunters. The mightiest vampire hunters may even fight hordes of these lowly vampires at once, for these creatures usually rely on numbers to compensate for their individual weakness.  

The nature of these relatively weak vampires varies from vampire to vampire. Most are simply extremely young vampires who weren't particularly extraordinary in life and failed to develop into anything but a mediocre example of their kind. Some eventually grow into more powerful vampires, but most meet violent demise shortly into their unlife. Others may have intentionally been created to be weak of body and will by vampiric masters who sought to rapidly grow an expendable and easily controllable undead horde.

### Vampire Spawn

These monsters are a step up from the lowly vampire "wretches," though they are still considered neophytes amongst their kind. They are typically created from more noteworthy individuals who were inducted into vampirism and managed to fully capture the dark gift that was bestowed upon them. Though they have become "true" vampires and become deadly creatures of the night, they are still reckless and inexperienced. Because they have yet to master their bloodthirst, vampire spawn will feed regularly and quickly draw attention to themselves if left to their own devices. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

As such, most spawn remain bound to the will of the vampire who sired them. This sire will teach them how to control their unholy appetites and avoid being hunted by vengeful humanoids; a vital skill for young vampires who would stand little chance against a seasoned vampire hunter. For all the guidance their sire offers, the vampire spawn is still ultimately a pawn in the eyes of its master, and most meet their end in service to a master who will gladly sacrifice them to ensure his or her own survival. Still, a rare few vampire spawn manage to break away from their sire and grow over the ages into powerful vampires of their own.

### Lesser Vampires
When vampire thralls survive long enough to grow in power and eventually strike out on their own, they usually stop being referred to as thralls and become "true" vampires in their own right. However, they are still far from the status of the vampiric masters they broke away from, who referred to them derisively as "lesser" vampires. 

These vampires usually have yet to establish significant holdings for status for themselves. Their lairs lack the majesty of elder vampires, and the undead forces they can muster are relatively small. 

\columnbreak

As such, these vampires are often wanderers, seeking to expand their knowledge, power, and influence.  Their eternal life has not yet stretched out to the point that they've become bored with the world, and they are eager to plunder it as they see fit, using their newfound power and independence. These unholy endeavors make lesser vampires the most likely to come into direct conflict with bands of hunters and adventurers. Whether these vampires ever grow to become true lords of darkness depends on whether they survive these early escapades in their unlife.

### Vampire Creation <br> Rules for Your World
The specifics of how vampires are created in your setting dramatically influence their threat level, how they interact with players, and their narrative role in the story.

You may decide that the curse spreads easily; a single vampire could convert an entire town in a few days as dozens of residents are turned each night. Alternatively, you may rule that vampirism only takes hold in those who already harbor evil in their soul, amplifying existing darkness rather than creating it from nothing, or that only more noteworthy individuals can be turned into true vampires, with the rest becoming meager vampire wretches.

#### Optional Rule: Turning Humanoids into Vampires
If you want true vampires (rather than mere vampire wretches and spawn) to be able to create others of their kind, you may grant them the following trait:

***Curse of Vampirism.*** If a Humanoid dies from having its hit point maximum reduced to 0 by this vampire’s bite attack, it rises the following night as a vampire.

##### Turning Player Characters Into Vampires
If you have a situation where a player character has been turned into a vampire, you can use the following guidelines.
  * The transformed player character retains all of its original game statistics.
 * The character gains the vampire’s Darkvision, a climb speed equal to its walk, the vampire's resistances and immunities, all of its traits, its Vampiric Powers (if any), and its bite and claw attacks (these count as unarmed strikes for the character).


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

> ##### Greater Vampires & Vampiric Powers Coming Soon!
> Future updates to this document will include more powerful vampires and different customizable powers you can add to different stat blocks. So, stay tuned!

<br>

 * The save DC for any vampiric abilities the character gains is 8 + the original vampire’s proficiency bonus + the original vampire’s choice of its Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier (whichever is highest).
 * The character’s alignment immediately becomes evil if it was previously good or neutral.
 * The DM may assume control of the character until the vampirism is cured (via a wish spell) or the character is killed and resurrected.

##### Optional Caveats & Limitations
You can mix and match any of the following restrictions to control how easily new vampires appear in your world:
 * **Master’s Children.** Only a Master Vampire or Vampire Lord can create new vampires.
 * **Bound by Blood.** A newly created vampire is permanently under the control of its creator.
 * **Blood Kiss.** Simply draining a victim to death is not enough. To create a vampire, the sire must feed the victim some of its own blood while the victim lies dying or freshly dead. If you're using this rule, the vampire gains the following additional action:

***Blood Kiss.*** The vampire takes 5 Slashing damage (which cannot be reduced in any way) and must be within 5 feet of a creature that died from its bite attack within the last minute. If this action is completed, the victim rises as a true vampire the following night.

 * **Dark Soul.** Only creatures that are already of evil alignment can be turned into vampires.
