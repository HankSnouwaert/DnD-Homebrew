## Monstrous Actions

If you wish to make your vampire a true solo threat, you may grant it an extra Monstrous Action it can use each round of combat, increasing its CR by 1.

This grants the vampire an additional action in combat, taken on Initiative Count 21 (losing ties), separate from the vampire’s normal initiative. On that count, the vampire can take one of the following actions, provided it is not Incapacitated; it may still use Tenacious Will even while Incapacitated.

**Tenacious Will.**  If the vampire is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw at the start or end of its turn (or as an action), it can immediately make that saving throw with advantage. On a success, the effect ends.

**Rush.**  The vampire moves up to 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Swipe.**  *Melee Weapon Attack:* Vampiric Power Bonus to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (3d12) Slashing damage.

**Vampiric Power.** The vampire uses one of its Vampiric Powers.

**Spellcasting.** The vampire casts a 1st- or 2nd-level spell it knows from any spellcasting feature it has.

You may choose to grant the vampire additional Monstrous Actions on Initiative Count 15 and Initiative Count 0 (losing ties). For each additional action granted this way, the vampire’s challenge rating increases by 1.

##  Vampiric Traits & Powers

Any vampire can be given any of the following Vampiric Traits or Vampiric Powers. Vampiric Traits are passive abilities, and each one granted increases its CR by 1 unless otherwise stated. Vampric Powers can be used as a Bonus Action, and granting one or more of these powers increases the vampire's CR by 1. If a Vampiric Power involves an attack roll or forces a saving throw, the attack bonus or save DC used can be found in the Vampire's stat block in the Vampiric Power bonus action. 

### General Vampiric Traits & Powers
The following abilities are non-specific in their theme and could be applied to a broad swath of vampires from different backgrounds.

#### Flying Horror (Vampiric Trait)

*Some vampires can rise into the night sky, floating effortlessly and soaring through the heavens. From above, they swoop down to gorge themselves on prey below.*

The Vampire has a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover. Vampire Masters and Vampire Lords gain a fly speed of 70.

#### Misty Step (Vampiric Power)

*When threatened, the vampire can dissolve into vapor and vanish, only to reform elsewhere moments later.*

The vampire teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see.

####  Night Stalker (Vampiric Trait)

*As silent as the flutter of a moth’s wing, the vampire moves across walls and ceilings and is able to pass through the smallest of openings to reach its unsuspecting victim.*

The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check, and can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing. The vampire also gains a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) Checks.

#### Regeneration (Vampiric Trait)

*Even when inflicted with wounds that would kill any mortal, the vampire’s body continually renews itself. Torn flesh knits back together in moments, and shattered bones fuse and become whole once more.*

The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes Radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.

#### Spectral Form (Vampiric Trait)

*The most formidable vampires have shed their physical bodies, becoming phantasmal beings able to pass effortlessly through walls, barriers, and fortifications. Conventional weapons are largely ineffective against these specters, rendering them nearly indestructible.*

The Vampire has a Fly Speed of 10 feet and can hover. The Vampire can move through other creatures and objects as if they were Difficult Terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) Force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It also gains resistance to all damage types except Force, Psychic, and Radiant. 

**Increases CR by 2.** Granting the vampire this trait increases its CR by 2 rather than 1.

#### Supernatural Terror (Vampiric Trait)

*The vampire’s wicked spirit has twisted its appearance into a manifestation of pure corruption. Any creature that gazes upon this horrific visage bears witness to true evil and is gripped by overwhelming dread.*

The Vampire emits an aura of terror in 30-foot emanation from itself. Each non-allied creature that starts its turn in the aura must make a Wisdom saving throw.

 *Failure:* The creature becomes Frightened of the <br> Vampire until the end of the Vampire’s next turn. <br> While Frightened, the creature can’t cast spells <br> other than cantrips.  <br>
 &emsp;*Failure by 5+:* While Frightened, the creature <br> can’t take reactions or Bonus Actions and <br> must use the Dash action on its turn to <br> move away from the vampire by <br> the safest route.  <br>
 &emsp;*Success:* The creature is <br> immune to this aura for <br> 1 hour.

\columnbreak

#### Vomit Blood (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire spews forth the remnants of its last meal in a crimson torrent. Those bathed in the frothing blood suffer rapid necrosis as the tainted vitae eats away at flesh.*

*Constitution Saving Throw:* each creature in a 20-foot cone.

 *Failure:*  18 (4d8) Necrotic damage. 
 *Failure by 5+:* The target can't regain hit points for 1 minute.  
 *Success:* Half damage only.

The vampire can't use this power again until it regains life from its bite attack.

#### Walking Death (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire can fixate upon a mortal, imposing its unholy presence on the victim. The target’s mind becomes consumed by thoughts of impending death, leaving them mentally crippled by fear and despair.*

*Wisdom Saving Throw:* one creature the vampire can see within 60 feet.

 *Failure:* The creature becomes Frightened of the  Vampire until the end of the vampire’s next turn. While Frightened, the creature is Dazed* and can’t cast spells other than cantrips.  <br>
 *Failure by 5+:* While Frightened, the target is Paralyzed.  <br>
 *Success:* The creature is immune to the vampire's Walking Death for 1 hour. <br>

**New condition described at the end of the document*

### Aristocrat Vampires
Across the world lie lands and provinces steeped in sordid reputation. These regions are swathed in dark forests that leech what little nourishment remains from ashen soil. Small villages cling to existence within these realms, inhabited by superstitious folk who struggle to survive amid ever-present danger, scraping sustenance from an unforgiving land.

Within such dismal realms, it is the castles and grand estates looming above the countryside that harbor the greatest evil. Within these foreboding structures reside vampires—aristocrats who present themselves as noble men and women, clad in the finest garments and living amid luxury, surrounded by masterworks of art and priceless antiquities. Arrogant and vain, they refuse to skulk through alleys or drag screaming prey into the dark. Instead, they feed as befits nobility.

Such vampires form insidious bonds with those they hunt. Some torment their victims over weeks, using charm and influence to be welcomed into their homes, feasting night after night as helpless prey slowly falls under their thrall. Others host lavish balls attended by their dark kind and other favored guests, while their minions scour the countryside, abducting the most beautiful and desirable specimens to be brought back and toyed with amid macabre celebrations.

This pride also makes aristocrat vampires the boldest of their kind when it comes to conquest. Stories tell of malevolent nobles taking residence in forgotten estates with long and tragic histories, only for the surrounding lands to descend into catastrophe. Often, such vampires are drawn to a region by twisted sentiment, such as a local resident reminding them of lost lovers or companions from former lives, or its landscape echoing a realm they once ruled centuries ago and now seek to recreate.

Those who attempt to end such cruel dominion soon discover the depth of an aristocrat vampire’s power. Legions of vile minions stand ready in defense of their dread monarch. Beasts of the night flock to these lords of darkness, who themselves can assume the forms of such creatures. Their authority is so absolute that even the winds seem to bow to their command, and the undead fight with sadistic zeal.

Foremost among their servants are lesser vampire spawn. The bond between master and thrall is so intimate that when a spawn gorges itself on stolen blood, the vitality drawn forth can flow back to revitalize its lord.

#### Air of Dark Majesty (Vampiric Trait)

*So absolute is the tyrannical authority of the vampiric lord that the dire creatures under its command are imbued with foul power, strengthened by its malignant presence.*

The vampire radiates a magical aura in a 30-foot emanation. While in the aura, the vampire and its allies deal an extra 5 (1d10) Necrotic damage the first time they hit with an attack roll on each of their turns.

#### Bat Form (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire undergoes a grotesque metamorphosis, becoming a massive bat. In this hideous form, the monster dives from above, tearing into its foes to feast on the nectar in their veins.*

The vampire magically polymorphs into a Bat for as long as it maintains Concentration, up to 1 hour. Any equipment the vampire is wearing or carrying either falls to the ground or merges into the new form (the vampire’s choice). Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while the vampire remains transformed.

While in Bat Form, the vampire retains its statistics, except as noted below:

- Its Walk Speed becomes 10 feet.
- It gains a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
- It loses any Climb Speed it has.
- It can’t cast spells.
- It gains the following trait:

***Flyby.*** The vampire doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

The vampire can revert to its true form as a Bonus Action. If it reverts while airborne, it descends safely at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground.

Once the vampire uses this power, it can’t do so again until it finishes a Short or Long Rest.

#### Bat Whisperer (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire emits a faint cry at a pitch no mortal can perceive. The call is irresistible to the winged children of the night, which gather in churning black clouds to engulf the living in a sea of fangs.*

The vampire summons a **Duskhunter Swarm** in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it. The swarm remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points or until the vampire dies.

A swarm summoned this way acts on Initiative Count 0 (losing ties) of each round. If the vampire attempts to summon a swarm while three or more swarms summoned by this power are already active, the vampire must choose one existing swarm to be immediately destroyed.

**Increases CR by 2.** Granting the vampire this power increases its CR by 2 rather than 1.


#### Dark Wind (Vampiric Power)

*A spiteful storm gathers around the vampire—a blustering squall infused with malice. Raging winds batter all caught within, hurling soldiers to the ground and casting aside arrows and spears, while the vampire strides unhindered at the heart of the whirlwind.*

The vampire radiates raging winds in a 30-foot emanation for as long as it maintains Concentration, up to 1 hour.

The wind has the following effects:

- Unprotected flames that are torch-sized or smaller are extinguished within the area.
- Vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind are dispersed within the area.
- The area is Difficult Terrain for creatures other than the vampire.
- A creature other than the vampire that ends its turn in the area must make a *Constitution Saving Throw*. The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the creature is 5 feet or more above the ground.  
   *Failure:* The creature loses Concentration (if any), is knocked Prone, and is pushed up to 10 feet directly away from the vampire.
- Attack rolls for ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attack passes into or out of the area.

Once the vampire uses this power, it can’t do so again until it finishes a Short or Long Rest.

#### Sanguine Conduit (Vampiric Trait)

*While feeding, the vampire forges an ominous link between itself and nearby undead monstrosities, channeling the stolen life it consumes to fortify its cohort.*

When the vampire regains hitpoints from it's bite attack, it can choose for another undead creature it can see with in 30 feet it to also regain the same amount of hitpoints as well.

#### Wolfcaller (Vampiric Power)

*Howls echo through the darkness of the night—praises offered to their monarch. Any who oppose this lord of the pack are swiftly beset by slavering jaws from all sides.*
