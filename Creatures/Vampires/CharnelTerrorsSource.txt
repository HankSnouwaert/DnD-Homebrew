## Charnel Terrors
*Monstrous Undead Steeds Crafted By Masters of Death*<br>
**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** None <br>
Those most well-versed in necromancy and possessing the most heinous imaginations create their own unique monstrosities to ride to war. These blasphemous entities are collectively known as charnel terrors. There is no single way to craft such heinous servants; countless rituals and processes have been devised over centuries of forbidden research.

Some are cobbled together from the parts of other ferocious creatures, such as griffins, manticores, or wyverns, while iron bones, tendons, or talons are fused into the monster’s frame to further enhance its might. The bound cadavers are revivified with necromantic spells, sutured limbs twitching as unholy magic forces their adventitious organs and mismatched appendages to unite in profane purpose, driving the creature to rise and serve its master.

Others are shadows given physical form by prodigious amounts of dark magic. Such nightmares made flesh are haunting things, onyx skin stretched over a muscled body that continuously wafts blood-chilling mist. They soar through the air on black wings, their gaunt, bestial faces adorned with orbs pale as moonlight for eyes that peer hungrily at any living creature, ravenous for the warmth of life.

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.

Because of the many ways these anathema beasts may be spawned, the arsenal of deadly tools at their disposal is wildly unpredictable. Some terrors bear fangs and claws encased in iron, devilishly sharp enough to shear through plate armor. Others possess stingers capable of injecting toxins that can paralyze a warhorse within seconds. Still others grow antlers, horns, or steel-infused craniums, battering rams strong enough to smash castle gates or pulverize stone. The most horrifying of all may be those whose saliva, blue as sapphire, can freeze flesh solid upon contact.

Regardless of their origin, all charnel terrors share one unifying trait: a truly horrifying presence that scars the psyche of any living soul forced to behold such a vile creation. Only the most stalwart soldiers can stand before an charnel terror, for any who draw near to such a loathsome fiend need no instruction to recognize its wicked nature; they see its unearthly movements and hear the atrocious sounds it utters, and terror roots itself in their very marrow.

#### Abominable Limbs
Select two different limbs from the following list to apply to your abominable terror.

***Sword Claws.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 6) Slashing damage. If the attack misses, the target must make a *Dexterity Saving Throw:* DC 18. 
<br> *Failure:* The charnel terror automatically hits the target with a Sword Claws attack, dealing half the damage.
<br> *Failure by 5+* The target takes the full damage of the attack.

***Poisonous Barbs.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 6) Piercing damage, and the target must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 18. 
<br> *Failure:* The target is Poisoned. A creature Poisoned this way repeats the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.
<br> *Failure by 5+ (Including Repeat Saves):* The target is Paralyzed until the Poison ends.

***Heat-Sapping Jaws.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 6) Piercing damage, and the target gains the Burning* condition, taking 11 (2d10) Cold damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends. While Burning, the creature's speed is halved. A creature immune or resistant to cold damage ignores this speed reduction.

***Crushing Horns.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* +10, reach 10 ft. *Hit:* 30 (4d10 + 6) Bludgeoning damage. If the charnel terror moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before the hit, the target takes an additional 13 (3d8) Bludgeoning damage and must make a *Strength Saving Throw:* DC 18. 

*Failure:* The target is knocked Prone and pushed upto 15 feet away from charnel terror.

*Failure by 5+*  If the target is Prone, it can't stand until the end of its next turn unless it spends all its movement to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a success, it stands up.

**New condition described on previous page*

####  Charnel Terror Tactics

Charnel terrors strike at creatures unaffected by their Terrifying Presence, diving in and out of melee while staying airborne when possible. Their targeting priorities shift depending on the abominable limbs they possess. A charnel terror has little tactical insight on its own, but a cunning master can direct it toward optimal targets.

* **Sword Claws** – Prefers low-Dexterity foes with high AC.
* **Poisonous Barb** – Targets creatures with low Constitution and no Poison resistance.
* **Heat-Sapping Jaws** – Focuses on isolated creatures, making the Burning condition harder to remove.
* **Crushing Horns** – Seeks out enemies with low Strength and that rely on high mobility.
