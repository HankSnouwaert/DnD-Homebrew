# Vampires 1.2

Among the undead that defy the natural order, raised from the grave to plague the living, few outstrip vampires in the power they wield or the danger they pose to the mortal world.

Most undead are mindless killers: shambling zombies or skeletal warriors that either obey the exact instructions of their creators or wander aimlessly, slaying any living thing that crosses their path. Others, like ghosts and banshees, are trapped by past grudges or personal failings from their former lives, locking them into narrow-minded, predictable behavior. They are unable to learn or change as the centuries pass.

Vampires, in deadly contrast, are ambitious creatures. Upon their unholy rebirth, their desires are unfettered. They pursue what they coveted most in life with heartless rapacity, regarding no other being in their single-minded chase. A vampire retains the ability to learn and adapt over time, allowing it to devote lifetimes to mastering any skill needed to overcome adversaries who stand in the way of its cravings. Moreover, a vampire’s supernatural powers grow stronger the older it becomes; the most ancient of their kind are near-godlike in capability, rivaling even the dreaded lich or death knight.

The nature of a vampire can vary drastically from one individual to another, sometimes so greatly that two vampires might not even be recognized as the same type of undead. A great many bloodlines afflict the realms, and a vampire’s own disposition and desires further mold its form over the years.

Some can pass for human, often possessing an unearthly beauty; yet those who look closely will notice skin as pale as a corpse. When their emotions flare or they call upon dark magics, a vampire’s true monstrous nature is laid bare: glistening fangs, crimson eyes that glow in the dark, or other horrific features manifest in these moments of fury. Some have been completely consumed by their feral nature and bear a beastly visage, their humanity all but gone. Others fully embrace their undead state: flesh rotting, wafting a malodor that permeates the air around them; some are little more than grey, dry skin stretched over bone, eyes crumbled to dust, leaving ghastly sockets above a withered, tongueless maw that boasts only protruding fangs.

Beyond appearance, the abilities a vampire possesses are equally unpredictable. Some can entrance mortals with an ensnaring gaze or enslave them with a single bite, compelling their thralls to commit any manner of treasonous act in service to their new master. Others wield the most powerful magics, spells that dredge hordes of long-forgotten undead from the depths of the earth, or hurl bolts of life-draining black energy that ravage foes and leave only withered husks behind. Many can summon swarms of bats to darken the sky or packs of wolves to run down their prey; some can even transform into such beasts themselves and join their children in the hunt.

Yet as powerful as vampires are, each possesses particular weaknesses that vampire hunters and others who seek to destroy these wicked monsters can exploit. Silver burns most vampires on contact, and a blow from a silver weapon may cause them to burst into flame. Running water can erode their flesh;  garlic and certain herbs repel them or make them violently ill. The most common weakness is an aversion  to direct sunlight, which can weaken a vampire or even immolate it outright.

The one trait that binds all vampires is their need to feast on the blood of mortals, and all of their kind possess enough otherworldly strength and speed to wrestle down a victim and drink deep from the nectar in their veins. Such insatiable hunger is the eternal price of their undying existence.

## Vampire Weaknesses
You can apply one or all of the following weaknesses to any of the vampires listed in this document.

* **Forbiddance.** The vampire can’t enter a residence without an invitation from an occupant.
* **Garlic.** Any Vampire that starts its turn within 5 feet of a large amount of garlic must make a DC 15 Constitution save. If it fails, until the end of its next turn, it moves at half speed, can't use its Vampiric Powers, and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.
* **Running Water.** The vampire takes 20 Acid damage if it ends its turn in running water.
* **Stake to the Heart.** The vampire is destroyed if a weapon that deals Piercing damage is driven into the vampire’s heart while the vampire is Incapacitated.
* **Silvered Weapons.** Whenever the vampire takes damage from a slivered weapon, it takes an additional 1d6 Radiant damage.
* **Sunlight.** The vampire takes 20 Radiant damage if it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has Disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

## Vampire Variants
The following are representations of vampires across a range of power levels.

### Vampire Wretches
Some vampires are so far down the dark hierarchy of their kind that they are but wretches compared to the mightiest lords of night. Though these creatures are more deadly than a typical human, the extent of their vampiric abilities is limited, and they are easily dispatched by experienced hunters. The mightiest vampire slayers may even fight hordes of these lowly vampires at once, for these creatures usually rely on numbers to compensate for their individual weakness.  

The nature of these relatively weak vampires varies from vampire to vampire. Most are simply extremely young vampires who weren't particularly extraordinary in life and failed to develop into anything but a mediocre example of their kind. Some eventually grow into more powerful vampires, but most meet violent demise shortly into their unlife. Others may have intentionally been created to be weak of body and will by vampiric masters who sought to rapidly grow an expendable and easily controllable undead horde.

### Vampire Spawn

These monsters are a step up from the lowly vampire "wretches," though they are still considered neophytes amongst their kind. They are typically created from more noteworthy individuals who were inducted into vampirism and managed to fully capture the dark gift that was bestowed upon them. Though they have become "true" vampires and become deadly creatures of the night, they are still reckless and inexperienced. Because they have yet to master their bloodthirst, vampire spawn will feed regularly and quickly draw attention to themselves if left to their own devices. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

As such, most spawn remain bound to the will of the vampire who sired them. This sire will teach them how to control their unholy appetites and avoid being hunted by vengeful humanoids; a vital skill for young vampires who would stand little chance against a seasoned vampire hunter. For all the guidance their sire offers, the vampire spawn is still ultimately a pawn in the eyes of its master, and most meet their end in service to a master who will gladly sacrifice them to ensure his or her own survival. Still, a rare few vampire spawn manage to break away from their sire and grow over the ages into powerful vampires of their own.

### Lesser Vampires
When vampire thralls survive long enough to grow in power and eventually strike out on their own, they usually stop being referred to as thralls and become "true" vampires in their own right. However, they are still far from the status of the vampiric masters they broke away from, who referred to them derisively as "lesser" vampires. 

These vampires usually have yet to establish significant holdings for status for themselves. Their lairs lack the majesty of elder vampires, and the undead forces they can muster are relatively small.

As such, these vampires are often wanderers, seeking to expand their knowledge, power, and influence.  Their eternal life has not yet stretched out to the point that they've become bored with the world, and they are eager to plunder it as they see fit, using their newfound power and independence. These unholy endeavors make lesser vampires the most likely to come into direct conflict with bands of hunters and adventurers. Whether these vampires ever grow to become true lords of darkness depends on whether they survive these early escapades in their unlife.

### Vampire Lords
As lesser vampires endure through the ages, gaining power and experience, they eventually come to be known as vampire lords. Amongst their own kind, they are regarded as high nobility, and many command great influence thanks to the knowledge, connections, and assets they've accrued over the ages. Such vampires may take control of castles, dark manors, isolated towers, or vast necropolises. These lairs are inevitably filled with sinister minions bound to the will of their dark master, many of whom are likely weaker vampires.

Vampire lords make for cunning and deadly foes. They have survived many lifetimes' worth of trials and tribulations to reach their status, and they've learned to control their bloodthirst, unlike their rash, younger counterparts. 

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

They often rely on minions to do most of their dirty work, and only directly engage with foes who've proven to be especially dangerous or troublesome, or who have done something to pique their curiosity. Even then, most vampires are patient and deliberate, preying on their enemies only when they have the upperhand. Should an especially powerful (or lucky) foe manage to best them, vampire lords are usually quick to abandon their plans (and even all their minions and belongings) to escape with their unlives. For time is on their side, and they've learned to be patient. Any who best a vampire but fail to slay it, will inevitably feel its vengeance when they least suspect it.

### Master Vampires

On rare occasion, a vampire's existence will stretch across so many ages, and it will accrue so much power that it will reach the dark pinnacle of its kind. These ancient creatures have watched civilizations rise and fall, countless generations of mortals grow and perish, and even most of their own vampiric peers meet a violent end. They have endured it all, and as the years lose meaning, most become detached from the seeming mundanity of the mortal world. Many sleep for decades or even centuries at a time, waking only to pursue grand schemes spanning untold ages.

To face a master vampire is to face a being whose existence dwarfs most civilizations and who wields dark power otherwise lost to time. These monsters view most living beings as insects waiting to die. Despite this, some master vampires remain relatively engaged with the machinations of mortals, actively scheming and gathering power over the centuries. These vampires may be the heads of vast family networks of vampire lords and lesser vampires. Other master vampires grow disinterested in the world and withdraw from it almost entirely. The creatures inevitably go mad as the meaninglessness of time allows them to pursue their dark obsessions with no end or check on their sanity.

## Monstrous Actions

If you wish to make your vampire a true solo threat, you may grant it an extra Monstrous Action it can use each round of combat, increasing its CR by 1.

This grants the vampire an additional action in combat, taken on Initiative Count 21 (losing ties), separate from the vampire’s normal initiative. On that count, the vampire can take one of the following actions, provided it is not Incapacitated; it may still use Tenacious Will even while Incapacitated.

**Tenacious Will.**  If the vampire is subject to an ongoing effect that allows a saving throw at the start or end of its turn (or as an action), it can immediately make that saving throw with advantage. On a success, the effect ends.

**Rush.**  The vampire moves up to 20 feet without provoking opportunity attacks.

**Swipe.**  *Melee Weapon Attack:* Vampiric Power Bonus to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 19 (3d12) Slashing damage.

**Vampiric Power.** The vampire uses one of its Vampiric Powers.

**Spellcasting.** The vampire casts a 1st- or 2nd-level spell it knows from any spellcasting feature it has.

You may choose to grant the vampire additional Monstrous Actions on Initiative Count 15 and Initiative Count 0 (losing ties). For each additional action granted this way, the vampire’s challenge rating increases by 1.

##  Vampiric Traits & Powers

Any vampire can be given any of the following Vampiric Traits or Vampiric Powers. Vampiric Traits are passive abilities, and each one granted increases its CR by 1 unless otherwise stated. Vampric Powers can be used as a Bonus Action, and granting one or more of these powers increases the vampire's CR by 1. If a Vampiric Power involves an attack roll or forces a saving throw, the attack bonus or save DC used can be found in the Vampire's stat block in the Vampiric Power bonus action. 

### General Vampiric Traits & Powers
The following abilities are non-specific in their theme and could be applied to a broad swath of vampires from different backgrounds.

#### Flying Horror (Vampiric Trait)

*Some vampires can rise into the night sky, floating effortlessly and soaring through the heavens. From above, they swoop down to gorge themselves on prey below.*

The Vampire has a Fly Speed of 60 feet and can hover. Vampire Masters and Vampire Lords gain a fly speed of 70.

#### Misty Step (Vampiric Power)

*When threatened, the vampire can dissolve into vapor and vanish, only to reform elsewhere moments later.*

The vampire teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space that it can see.

\pagebreakNum

####  Night Stalker (Vampiric Trait)

*As silent as the flutter of a moth’s wing, the vampire moves across walls and ceilings and is able to pass through the smallest of openings to reach its unsuspecting victim.*

The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make an ability check, and can move through and stop in a space large enough to fit a creature one size smaller than it without squeezing. The vampire also gains a +5 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) Checks.

#### Regeneration (Vampiric Trait)

*Even when inflicted with wounds that would kill any mortal, the vampire’s body continually renews itself. Torn flesh knits back together in moments, and shattered bones fuse and become whole once more.*

The vampire regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the vampire takes Radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.

#### Spectral Form (Vampiric Trait)

*The most formidable vampires have shed their physical bodies, becoming phantasmal beings able to pass effortlessly through walls, barriers, and fortifications. Conventional weapons are largely ineffective against these specters, rendering them nearly indestructible.*

The Vampire has a Fly Speed of 10 feet and can hover. The Vampire can move through other creatures and objects as if they were Difficult Terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) Force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. It also gains resistance to all damage types except Force, Psychic, and Radiant. 

**Increases CR by 2.** Granting the vampire this trait increases its CR by 2 rather than 1.

#### Supernatural Terror (Vampiric Trait)

*The vampire’s wicked spirit has twisted its appearance into a manifestation of pure corruption. Any creature that gazes upon this horrific visage bears witness to true evil and is gripped by overwhelming dread.*

The Vampire emits an aura of terror in 30-foot emanation from itself. Each non-allied creature that starts its turn in the aura must make a Wisdom saving throw.

 *Failure:* The creature becomes Frightened of the <br> Vampire until the end of the Vampire’s next turn. <br> While Frightened, the creature can’t cast spells <br> other than cantrips.  <br>
 &emsp;*Failure by 5+:* While Frightened, the creature <br> can’t take reactions or Bonus Actions and <br> must use the Dash action on its turn to <br> move away from the vampire by <br> the safest route.  <br>
 &emsp;*Success:* The creature is <br> immune to this aura for <br> 1 hour.

\columnbreak

#### Vomit Blood (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire spews forth the remnants of its last meal in a crimson torrent. Those bathed in the frothing blood suffer rapid necrosis as the tainted vitae eats away at flesh.*

*Constitution Saving Throw:* each creature in a 20-foot cone.

 *Failure:*  18 (4d8) Necrotic damage. 
 *Failure by 5+:* The target can't regain hit points for 1 minute.  
 *Success:* Half damage only.

The vampire can't use this power again until it regains life from its bite attack.

#### Walking Death (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire can fixate upon a mortal, imposing its unholy presence on the victim. The target’s mind becomes consumed by thoughts of impending death, leaving them mentally crippled by fear and despair.*

*Wisdom Saving Throw:* one creature the vampire can see within 60 feet.

 *Failure:* The creature becomes Frightened of the  Vampire until the end of the vampire’s next turn. While Frightened, the creature is Dazed* and can’t cast spells other than cantrips.  <br>
 *Failure by 5+:* While Frightened, the target is Paralyzed.  <br>
 *Success:* The creature is immune to the vampire's Walking Death for 1 hour. <br>

### Arcane Vampire Traits
Many vampires devote their immortal existence to mastering the dark arts, spending centuries honing their arcane finesse. Unburdened by conscience or regret, they perform whatever forbidden rituals are required to further their craft. Most pursue necromancy, creating wretched servants from decaying cadavers, but a vampire’s particular obsessions may lead it to wield other forms of magic—calling forth chilling winds and hail, or animating living shadows to consume its foes in darkness.

Only the holy power wielded by clerics and the life-imbuing magic of druids lie beyond a vampire’s grasp, for such energies are anathema to its undead nature.

Most arcane vampires dwell in remote regions, where they can pursue their research without interference. Over lifetimes, they collect ancient manuscripts, forbidden artifacts, and strange specimens upon which to experiment as they further their knowledge. One would be a fool to believe that this isolation makes them any less of a blight upon the world. In truth, the fruits of such dark studies represent among the greatest perils posed by vampirekind, threatening to extinguish all life should their ambitions be realized.
For this reason, vampire hunters will go to any lengths to eradicate these vile wizards, braving whatever foul abominations and malevolent spells the creature has fashioned through its tainted sorcery.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

#### Adamant Focus (Vampiric Trait)

*Through iron discipline and assiduous practice, the vampire maintains its spells with unyielding focus. Even the strike of a blade or the surge of crackling energy coursing through its body offers little hope of breaking its concentration.*

While the vampire is concentrating on a spell, its concentration can’t be broken as a result of taking damage unless the damage is 10 or greater. In addition, the vampire has advantage on all saving throws made to maintain concentration.

#### Dark Acolyte (Vampiric Trait)

*Through arduous study of forbidden scrolls and long-buried tomes, the vampire draws upon a tide of volatile black magic. This power eddies around its withered form, elevating its spells to terrifying heights.*

At the end of its turn, the vampire can begin a ritual that draws upon the winds of magic. While this ritual is active, the vampire has advantage on spell attack rolls, and creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against its spells and its Vampiric Powers and Traits.

A creature within 15 feet of the vampire can use an Action or a Bonus Action to attempt to disrupt the ritual. Doing so requires the creature to make an Intelligence (Arcana) check against the vampire’s Vampiric Power save DC. A creature that makes this check as a Bonus Action does so with disadvantage. A creature that fails the check takes 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage.

Once the vampire uses this ritual, it can’t do so again until it finishes a Short or Long Rest.

\pagebreakNum

#### Dredge (Vampiric Power)

*With a flick of its pale hand, the vampire calls broken undead back to their unholy service. Souls bound to such a master do not escape so easily, and shattered corpses claw their way back into accursed motion.*

The vampire chooses the remains of an Undead creature of a lower CR than its own within 60 feet of it that was destroyed within the last 1 minute. That creature returns to undeath with 1 hit point.

This power can’t restore an Undead creature that is missing vital body parts, at the DM’s discretion.

#### Haemorrhage Magic (Vampiric Trait)

*The vampire can wither the spellcasting of others. With a disdainful utterance, an opposing spell destabilizes as its power bleeds away, causing the incantation to falter and its effects to weaken.*

The vampire can cast *Dampen Magic* at will. When casting the spell, it uses its Vampiric Power save DC.

**Increases CR by 2.** Granting the vampire this trait increases its CR by 2 rather than 1.

#### Lore Master (Vampiric Trait)

*The vampire has delved into forbidden mystic arts, wielding deadly spells to lay its foes low.*

The vampire chooses one of the following Lores of Magic: Beast, Death, Fire, Heavens, Metal, Shadow, or Vampiric. The chosen lore determines the traits it gains and the spells it knows. The vampire’s rank determines the number of spell slots it has and the levels of spells it can cast.

The vampire can cast its spells without material components. When casting a spell, it uses its Vampiric Power Save DC and Attack Bonus for its spell save DC and spell attack bonus. Its spellcasting ability modifier is always +5.

More powerful vampires gain access to additional spells and higher-level spell slots, as determined by their rank.

#### Ravaging Hex (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire lays a baleful curse upon its victim, robbing an aspect of the jinxed individual’s being while amplifying any affliction they suffer.*

The vampire curses a creature it is aware of within 100 feet of it for 1 minute. 

**Additional Damage.** While cursed, the first time each turn the vampire deals damage to the cursed creature, the target takes an extra 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage.

**Cursed Ability Score.** When the curse is applied, the vampire chooses one ability. The cursed creature has disadvantage on all d20 tests made using the chosen ability.

**Cursed Creature Reduced to 0 HP.** If the cursed creature drops to 0 hit points before the curse ends, the vampire can choose another creature it is aware of within 100 feet of it to become cursed for the remaining duration.

**Transferring The Curse.** A creature within 5 feet of the cursed creature can use an action or a Bonus Action to take the curse upon itself. If it does so, it immediately takes 10 (3d6) Necrotic damage and becomes cursed for the remaining duration.

Once the vampire uses this power, it can’t do so again until it finishes a short or long rest.

#### Raise Thralls (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire raises fallen warriors to serve without question, overwhelming its enemies with an unthinking tide of the dead.*

The vampire becomes aware of any Medium or Small pile of bones or corpse within 30 feet of it. It can choose one such pile of remains and raise it as an undead creature. The target becomes a **Skeleton Thrall** if bones are chosen or a **Zombie Thrall** if a corpse is chosen (stat blocks found on next page).

Undead raised by this power are destroyed when they drop to 0 hit points or when the vampire dies. These undead act on initiative count 0 (losing ties) each round.

If the vampire attempts to use this power while it already has three or more active thralls, it must choose one existing thrall to be immediately destroyed.

**Increases CR by 2.** Granting the vampire this trait increases its CR by 2 rather than 1.

#### Siphoning Tendrils (Vampiric Trait)

*Forsaking the crude act of feeding with its fangs, the vampire conjures writhing tendrils of onyx energy that slither through the air and plunge into living flesh. These tendrils drain warmth and vitality from their victims, revitalizing the vampire as life is torn away.*

The vampire’s Bite attack is modified in the following ways:

* It becomes a melee spell attack with a reach of 60 feet.
* The attack can be made against a creature even if it is not Grappled or willing.
* Any Piercing damage dealt by the attack becomes Cold damage.

### Aristocratic Vampire Traits
Across the world lie lands and provinces steeped in sordid reputation. These regions are swathed in dark forests that leech what little nourishment remains from ashen soil. Small villages cling to existence within these realms, inhabited by superstitious folk who struggle to survive amid ever-present danger, scraping sustenance from an unforgiving land.

Within such dismal realms, it is the castles and grand estates looming above the countryside that harbor the greatest evil. Within these foreboding structures reside vampires—aristocrats who present themselves as noble men and women, clad in the finest garments and living amid luxury, surrounded by masterworks of art and priceless antiquities. Arrogant and vain, they refuse to skulk through alleys or drag screaming prey into the dark. Instead, they feed as befits nobility.

Such vampires form insidious bonds with those they hunt. Some torment their victims over weeks, using charm and influence to be welcomed into their homes, feasting night after night as helpless prey slowly falls under their thrall. Others host lavish balls attended by their dark kind and other favored guests, while their minions scour the countryside, abducting the most beautiful and desirable specimens to be brought back and toyed with amid macabre celebrations.

This pride also makes aristocrat vampires the boldest of their kind when it comes to conquest. Stories tell of malevolent nobles taking residence in forgotten estates with long and tragic histories, only for the surrounding lands to descend into catastrophe. Often, such vampires are drawn to a region by twisted sentiment, such as a local resident reminding them of lost lovers or companions from former lives, or its landscape echoing a realm they once ruled centuries ago and now seek to recreate.

Those who attempt to end such cruel dominion soon discover the depth of an aristocrat vampire’s power. Legions of vile minions stand ready in defense of their dread monarch. Beasts of the night flock to these lords of darkness, who themselves can assume the forms of such creatures. Their authority is so absolute that even the winds seem to bow to their command, and the undead fight with sadistic zeal.

Foremost among their servants are lesser vampire spawn. The bond between master and thrall is so intimate that when a spawn gorges itself on stolen blood, the vitality drawn forth can flow back to revitalize its lord.

#### Air of Dark Majesty (Vampiric Trait)

*So absolute is the tyrannical authority of the vampiric lord that the dire creatures under its command are imbued with foul power, strengthened by its malignant presence.*

The vampire radiates a magical aura in a 30-foot emanation. While in the aura, the vampire and its allies deal an extra 5 (1d10) Necrotic damage the first time they hit with an attack roll on each of their turns.

#### Bat Form (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire undergoes a grotesque metamorphosis, becoming a massive bat. In this hideous form, the monster dives from above, tearing into its foes to feast on the nectar in their veins.*

The vampire magically polymorphs into a Bat for as long as it maintains Concentration, up to 1 hour. Any equipment the vampire is wearing or carrying either falls to the ground or merges into the new form (the vampire’s choice). Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while the vampire remains transformed.


While in Bat Form, the vampire retains its statistics, except as noted below:

- Its Walk Speed becomes 10 feet.
- It gains a Fly Speed of 60 feet.
- It loses any Climb Speed it has and gains a Climb speed of 10 feet.
- It can’t cast spells.
- It gains the following trait:

***Flyby.*** The vampire doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks when it flies out of an enemy’s reach.

The vampire can revert to its true form as a Bonus Action. If it reverts while airborne, it descends safely at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches the ground.

Once the vampire uses this power, it can’t do so again until it finishes a Short or Long Rest.

#### Bat Whisperer (Vampiric Power)

*The vampire emits a faint cry at a pitch no mortal can perceive. The call is irresistible to the winged children of the night, which gather in churning black clouds to engulf the living in a sea of fangs.*

The vampire summons a **Duskhunter Swarm** (stat block on next page) in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it. The swarm remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points or until the vampire dies.

A swarm summoned this way acts on Initiative Count 0 (losing ties) of each round. If the vampire attempts to summon a swarm while three or more swarms summoned by this power are already active, the vampire must choose one existing swarm to be immediately destroyed.

**Increases CR by 2.** Granting the vampire this power increases its CR by 2 rather than 1.


#### Dark Wind (Vampiric Power)

*A spiteful storm gathers around the vampire—a blustering squall infused with malice. Raging winds batter all caught within, hurling soldiers to the ground and casting aside arrows and spears, while the vampire strides unhindered at the heart of the whirlwind.*

The vampire radiates raging winds in a 30-foot emanation for as long as it maintains Concentration, up to 1 hour.

The wind has the following effects:

- The area is Difficult Terrain for creatures other than the vampire.
- Attack rolls from ranged weapon attacks have disadvantage if the attack passes into or out of the area.
- A creature other than the vampire that ends its turn in the area must make a *Constitution Saving Throw*. The saving throw is made with disadvantage if the creature is 5 feet or more above the ground.  
   *Failure:* The creature loses Concentration (if any), is knocked Prone, and is pushed up to 10 feet directly away from the vampire.

\columnbreak

- Unprotected flames that are torch-sized or smaller are extinguished within the area.
- Vapor, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind are dispersed within the area.

Once the vampire uses this power, it can’t do so again until it finishes a Short or Long Rest.

#### Sanguine Conduit (Vampiric Trait)

*While feeding, the vampire forges an ominous link between itself and nearby undead monstrosities, channeling the stolen life it consumes to fortify its cohort.*

When the vampire regains hit points from its Bite attack, it can choose one Undead creature it can see within 30 feet of it. That creature also regains hit points equal to the amount the vampire regained.



#### Wolfcaller (Vampiric Power)

*Howls echo through the darkness of the night—praises offered to their monarch. Any who oppose this lord of the pack are swiftly beset by slavering jaws from all sides.*

The vampire summons a **Nightpack Wolf** (stat block on next page) in an unoccupied space it can see within 30 feet of it. The wolf remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points or until the vampire dies.

A wolf summoned this way acts on Initiative Count 0 (losing ties) of each round. If the vampire attempts to summon a wolf while three or more wolves summoned by this power are already active, the vampire must choose one existing wolf to be immediately destroyed.

**Increases CR by 3.** Granting the vampire this power increases its CR by 3 rather than 1.


#### Wolf Form (Vampiric Power)

*With a savage snarl, the vampire’s body dissolves into shadow and reshapes into a sable wolf, its lupine form crowned with glistening, saber-like fangs.*

The vampire magically polymorphs into a Wolf for as long as it maintains Concentration, up to 1 hour. Any equipment the vampire is wearing or carrying either falls to the ground or merges into the new form (the vampire’s choice). Equipment that merges with the form has no effect while the vampire remains transformed.

While in Wolf Form, the vampire retains its statistics, except as noted below:

- Its Walk Speed becomes 60 feet.
- It loses any Climb Speed it has.
- It can’t cast spells.
- It gains the following traits:

***Trip.*** The vampire can use its Bite attack against a target even if the target isn’t Grappled or willing. On a hit, the target must succeed on a *Strength Saving Throw:* Vampiric Power DC.  
*Failure:* The target is knocked Prone.

***Pack Tactics.*** The vampire has advantage on attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the vampire’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t Incapacitated.

The vampire can revert to its true form as a Bonus Action.

Once the vampire uses this power, it can’t do so again until it finishes a Short or Long Rest.

## Vampire Creation <br> Rules for Your World
The specifics of how vampires are created in your setting dramatically influence their threat level, how they interact with players, and their narrative role in the story.

You may decide that the curse spreads easily; a single vampire could convert an entire town in a few days as dozens of residents are turned each night. Alternatively, you may rule that vampirism only takes hold in those who already harbor evil in their soul, amplifying existing darkness rather than creating it from nothing, or that only more noteworthy individuals can be turned into true vampires, with the rest becoming meager vampire wretches.

### Optional Rule: Turning Humanoids into Vampires
If you want true vampires (rather than mere vampire wretches and spawn) to be able to create others of their kind, you may grant them the following trait:

***Curse of Vampirism.*** If a Humanoid dies from having its hit point maximum reduced to 0 by this vampire’s bite attack, it rises the following night as a vampire.

#### Turning Player Characters Into Vampires
If you have a situation where a player character has been turned into a vampire, you can use the following guidelines.
  * The transformed player character retains all of its original game statistics.
 * The character gains the vampire’s Darkvision, a climb speed equal to its walk, the vampire's resistances and immunities, all of its traits, its Vampiric Powers (if any), and its bite and claw attacks (these count as unarmed strikes for the character).


\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

 * The save DC for any vampiric abilities the character gains is 8 + the original vampire’s proficiency bonus + the original vampire’s choice of its Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier (whichever is highest).
 * The character’s alignment immediately becomes evil if it was previously good or neutral.
 * The DM may assume control of the character until the vampirism is cured (via a wish spell) or the character is killed and resurrected.

#### Optional Caveats & Limitations
You can mix and match any of the following restrictions to control how easily new vampires appear in your world:
 * **Master’s Children.** Only a Master Vampire or Vampire Lord can create new vampires.
 * **Bound by Blood.** A newly created vampire is permanently under the control of its creator.
 * **Blood Kiss.** Simply draining a victim to death is not enough. To create a vampire, the sire must feed the victim some of its own blood while the victim lies dying or freshly dead. If you're using this rule, the vampire gains the following additional action:

***Blood Kiss.*** The vampire takes 5 Slashing damage (which cannot be reduced in any way) and must be within 5 feet of a creature that died from its bite attack within the last minute. If this action is completed, the victim rises as a true vampire the following night.

 * **Dark Soul.** Only creatures that are already of evil alignment can be turned into vampires.

## New Spells

### Vampiric Spells
The following spells are often utilized by vampires and other practitioners of dark necromantic magic. Some of them tap into decidedly vampiric powers, such as transforming the user into a flying swarm of blood suckers or draining the life from their victim. Others are more generalized forms of necromantic magic that can conjure or empower the dead. 

#### Carrion Swarm
*5th-level Transmutation (Druid, Ranger, Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

You transform into a swarm of blood-sucking pests until the start of your next turn, along with everything you are wearing and carrying. The spell ends early if you drop to 0 hit points.

While in this form:
* You have a Fly Speed of 60 feet and no other movement speeds. 
* You can enter and occupy the space of other creatures and do not provoke opportunity attacks. 
* You can pass through narrow openings as though you were a Tiny creature, but you treat liquids as solid surfaces.
* You have resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.
* You can’t be knocked Prone, Grappled, or Restrained.
* You have advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. 
* You can’t speak or manipulate objects, and any objects you were carrying or holding can’t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with.
* You can’t cast spells or make attacks other than those granted by this spell.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

During the turn you cast this spell, you can make up to three melee spell attacks. You can make each attack at any point during your turn against a creature whose space you occupy. On a hit, the target takes 5d4 Necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the Necrotic damage dealt.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d4 for each spell slot level above 5th.

#### Curse of Ages
*9th-level Enchantment (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an hourglass or pocket watch)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You curse a creature to age at an unnatural rate. Choose one creature within range. Until the spell ends, at the end of each of your turns, if the target is still within 90 feet of you, it must make a Constitution saving throw.

On a failed save, the target takes 10d10 Necrotic damage, gains one level of Fatigue*, and ages to the point where it has only 30 days left before dying of old age. If it already has 30 days or fewer remaining in its lifespan, it instead ages 2d4 days. 

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and does not gain Fatigue or age. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this spell dies of old age and is reduced to dust.

This spell can’t be ended by *Dispel Magic*. Only *Remove Curse* cast with a 9th-level spell slot or a *Wish* spell can end the spell’s effects, restore the target to its previous age, and remove any Fatigue caused by this spell.

#### Dance of Death
*1st-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Bonus Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

Threads of dark power leap from your fingers to an Undead creature you can see within range. Until the start of your next turn, the target’s Speed increases by 20 feet and it becomes Quickened*.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional Undead creature for each spell slot level above 1st.

**New condition decribed at end of Vampric Spells section*

#### Gale of Souls
*6th-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You tear a veil into the realm of the dead at a point you can see within range. A line of howling spectral wind 90 feet long and 10 feet wide erupts from that point in a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 20 feet away from the point, following the direction of the line. A creature that ends its turn in the line must repeat the saving throw.

**Changing Direction.** As a Bonus Action on your later turns, you can change the direction in which the line blasts from the point. after the direction is changed, each creature currently in the line must immediately make the same saving throw.

\columnbreak

**Moving Through The Wind.** A creature moving closer to the point must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves while within the line. In addition, when a creature moves into or within the line, it takes 2d4 Necrotic damage for every 5 feet it travels.

**Interactions With The Wind.** The winds disperse gas or vapor, and they extinguish flames in the area. The wind is not blocked by walls or other solid surfaces and extends into the Ethereal Plane if cast on the Material Plane.


#### Grasp of Dust
*4th-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

Your touch causes flesh to wither and crumble. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier Necrotic damage. If the target has hit points equal to 5 × the spell’s level or fewer after taking this damage, it is reduced to 0 hit points and dies. A creature that dies this way is reduced to dust.

You can make this attack again on each of your turns as an Action.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4th.

#### Rite of the Dead
*1st-level Necromancy (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gilded skull worth at least 50 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 8 hours

This spell creates an Undead servant. Choose a Medium or Small pile of bones or a corpse within range. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an Undead creature. The target becomes a **Skeleton Warrior** if you chose bones or a **Shambling Zombie** if you chose a corpse (this determines the stat block used). The Undead becomes inanimate again when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

\columnbreak

<br><br><br><br><br>

Undead created by this spell are allies to you and your companions. In combat, they share your initiative count, but they take their turns immediately after yours. They obey your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, they take the Dodge action and use their movement to avoid danger.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You animate one additional Undead for every two spell slot levels above 1st. Each Undead must be created from a different corpse or pile of bones. If you cast this spell using a 5th-level or higher spell slot, the casting time becomes 1 Action and the range becomes 60 feet.

*2nd-level Necromancy (Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (smelling salts)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

A willing creature you can see within range is imbued with unnatural vigor. It gains temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier for the duration. If the creature hits a target with a weapon attack while it has these temporary hit points, it can choose to expend all of them to deal additional Necrotic damage equal to the number of temporary hit points expended.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can target one additional creature for each spell slot level above 2nd.


#### Vampiric Touch (Revised)
*3rd-level Necromancy (Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand siphons life force from others to mend your own wounds. Make a melee spell attack against one creature within your reach. On a hit, the target takes 3d12 + your spellcasting ability modifier Necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the Necrotic damage dealt.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d12 for each spell slot level above 3rd.

#### Withering Gaze
*4th-level Necromancy (Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You fixate on two points within range, no more than 40 feet apart, that you can see. Beams of dark magic erupt from your eyes, rotting anything between the two points. Each creature intersected by the beams’ path must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier Necrotic damage. If both points occupy the same space, creatures at that point have disadvantage on the saving throw.

You can cause up to four Undead creatures of your choice within the area to automatically succeed on the saving throw, taking no damage. Instead, they are infused with unholy power, gaining temporary hit points equal to the total Necrotic damage dealt by the spell. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot level above 4th.

> ##### New Condition: Fatigue
> The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.
> 
> **Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.
> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue. 

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

### New Lore of Beasts Spells

#### Amber Spear

*3rd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:**  V S M (A Piece of Amber)
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous
- **Classes:**   Druid, Ranger
___

You conjure a large amber hunting spear and launch it in a straight line at a point you can see within range. Upon reaching its destination or striking a solid surface, the spear shatters, producing an explosion within a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point.

A Large spectral beast appears at a location you choose within range. Though it appears substantial, it is intangible and can be passed through and occupied by other creatures.

Any hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast is so distracted by its presence that it has disadvantage on attack rolls. At the end of each of your turns, each hostile creature within 5 feet of the beast must make a Dexterity saving throw as the beast assaults it. The creature takes 4d8 force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful save. 

If a hostile creature moves more than 5 feet away from the beast, that creature must make the same saving throw against the beast's damage effect unless it took the Disengage action.

At the start of each of your turns, if no hostile creatures are within 5 feet of the beast, it moves up to 40 feet toward the closest hostile creature it can see. The beast has blindsight out to 120 feet and is blind beyond this range.

***At Higher Levels.***  When casting this spell using a 5th-level spell slot or higher, the beast's damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 4th.

___

Drawing from wild energies, you transform into a mighty primal form of your choice: a **Feral Manticore**, a **Ravenous Hydra**, or a **Savage Dragon**. While transformed, you adopt the stat block of the selected beast (found on next two pages). Your game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by those of the chosen form, but you maintain your alignment and personality.

While in this new form:
* You assume its hit points.
* Your spell attack modifier and spell save DC replace its attack modifiers and saving throw DCs.
* If you're reduced to 0 hit points, you make death saving throws as usual. If you die, you revert to your true form.
* You can't speak, cast spells, or undertake any action requiring hands or speech.
* Your gear melds into your new form, rendering it inaccessible. As such, you can't activate, wield, or benefit from any of your equipment.

To attempt to end the spell, you may use your action to make a DC 15 saving throw using your original form's spellcasting ability modifier. On a successful save, the spell ends. However, if you fail this save three or more times within 8 hours, you must complete a long rest before attempting to end the spell again. A remove curse spell will also end the transformation.

If you take a long or short rest in your new form, only your new form gains the benefits of the rest

***At Higher Levels.***  When cast using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the new form gains an additional 25 hit points for each slot level above 6th. If cast using a 9th-level slot, any features the new form can use only once per day can now be used three times per day.

- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (A bar of lead)
- **Duration:**  1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You speak a word of power that transforms a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer, it automatically fails. On a failed save, it is Petrified, turning to gold until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature is Restrained until the end of your next turn.

**Ending The Effect.** A Petrified target can make a Constitution saving throw at the start of each of your turns, ending the effect on a success. However, if a creature accumulates three failed saves against this spell, it remains Petrified indefinitely until the condition is cured by other means.

**Effect On Other Creatures.** Any other creature that starts its turn within 60 feet of the petrified creature during the spell's duration must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Obsessed* with the Petrified creature until the start of its next turn. You can choose any number of creatures you can see to be immune to this effect.

- **Classes:**  Artificer, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Ranger

Choose one non-wondrous magic item you can see within range. The properties and powers of that magic item are suppressed for the duration of the spell—for example, a +1 longsword functions as a nonmagical longsword. If the item is a potion or other consumable, it does nothing upon being consumed. An item under the effect of this spell still counts as a magic item for the purposes of other spells and abilities, such as the *disintegrate* spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional magic item for each slot level above 2nd. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you may choose one wondrous magic item as one of your targets.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 ft
- **Components:** V, S, M (a piece of gold thread)
- **Duration:**  Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Artificer, Druid

You choose a creature with metal parts or a Medium or Small manufactured metal object weighing 80 pounds or less, such as a metal weapon, a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, or a metal door lock. A creature targeted by the spell can make a Constitution saving throw, ignoring the effects of the spell on a success.

An affected creature or object receives a -5 penalty to its AC, and any affected armor provides a -5 penalty to the AC it offers. Additionally, any weapon attacks made by an affected creature or using an affected object deal only half damage.

If you concentrate on this spell for the full duration, any nonmagical objects affected by the spell are destroyed, corroding into a pile of rust. A creature under the effects of the spell takes 3d6 necrotic damage at the end of each of its turns and makes a Constitution saving throw. The spell ends on the creature on a successful save.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature or object for each slot level above 3rd. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

\pagebreakNum

**Removing The Shard.** A creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the shard. On a success, the shard is removed, and on a failure, the shard is still removed, but the creature takes 1d8 slashing damage.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the piercing, fire, and slashing damage each increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.

*7th-level Conjuration (Bard, Cleric, Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action

You conjure an animated weapon infused with magical power. Choose Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage when you cast the spell. The weapon appears in an unoccupied space within range and lasts for the duration.

When the weapon appears, you may immediately make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 damage of the chosen type and suffers an additional effect based on the type selected:

* **Bludgeoning:** You can move the target up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space.

* **Piercing:** Treat any 1 or 2 rolled on the damage dice as a 3.

* **Slashing:** The target’s speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the weapon up to 20 feet to a space you can see and repeat the attack against the same or a different target within 5 feet.

You envelop up to three weapons you can see within range in phantasmal shadows, allowing them to slice through the minds of their targets. For the duration, when a creature is hit by an attack from one of these infused weapons, it takes an additional 1d12 psychic damage.

If a creature takes an action to examine one of the weapons and succeeds on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, they discern the illusion and will no longer take the additional psychic damage from any of the infused weapons.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can target one additional weapon for each slot level above 5th.

\columnbreak

You conjure a 20-foot-radius sphere of illusory fog at a point you choose within range. 

This miasma fills the air, spreading around corners and making the area heavily obscured for all creatures lacking true sight.

Any creature that starts its turn fully within the cloud must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8, until it exits the fog, after which it falls prone. The creature can then take the rest of its turn as normal.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 ft
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Wizard
___

You conjure a spectral pendulum that swings through a 60-foot-long, 5-foot-wide, and 5-foot-tall line of your choice within range. Each creature in this area can make a Dexterity or Intelligence saving throw (its choice). A creature takes 6d10 psychic damage on a failed save and no damage on a success.

On each of your subsequent turns during the spell's duration, you can use your action to cause the pendulum to swing back from the opposite direction it swang last, repeating the effect across the same line each time. If your turn ends without you using this action, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot.

\pagebreakNum

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You conjure a portal to a shadowy plane, opening a 20-foot square pit on an area of the ground you can see within range. Creatures within this area must make a Dexterity saving  throw. On a failed save, a creature is banished to a realm of darkness for the spell's duration. While in this realm, the creature is incapacitated.

At the end of each of its turns, the banished creature takes 3d8 psychic damage and must then make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the spell ends for that creature. When the spell ends for a creature, it reappears in its original space or the nearest unoccupied space if its original space is occupied. If a creature dies while banished, its body remains in the shadow realm; however, any magical items it was wearing or carrying return to the original location.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can increase the pit's dimensions by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**   Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

You release a surge of chilling shadows in a 15-foot-long, 5-foot-wide line that extends from you in a direction you choose. Each creature within the line must make a Constitution saving throw. Creatures take 1d10 cold damage, and on a failed save, and half as much on a success.

The line's area is then plunged into magical darkness until the end of your next turn. This darkness is impenetrable to darkvision and unaffected by nonmagical light sources.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the length of the line extends by an additional 5 feet for each slot level above 1st.

*9th-level Illusion (Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___

You summon a sphere of pure nightmares that warps the minds of those caught within. When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it.

A 20-foot-radius sphere of nightmares appears, centered on a point of your choice within range. When a creature enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes 5d10 Psychic damage and must make a Wisdom saving throw. 

On a failed save, the creature drops whatever it is holding, loses concentration, and becomes Frightened of the sphere for the duration. While Frightened in this way, it can’t take reactions and must use the Dash action to move away from the sphere by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. At the end of each of its turns, the Frightened creature takes 5d10 Psychic damage and can then repeat the Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

A creature that succeeds on its initial saving throw is immune to this spell for the rest of its duration.

On each of your subsequent turns, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet to a point you can see.

#### Withering Resolve

___

Choose a creature within range that can hear you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or its mind becomes filled with crippling doubt and inner turmoil. On a failed save, for the duration of the spell, the target has disadvantage on all checks and saving throws not triggered by this spell, and attack rolls against it have advantage. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw, ending the effects on a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 3rd.

\pagebreakNum

## New Conditions

#### Dazed 
A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a Move, an Action, or a Bonus Action; it gets only one of the three.

#### Fatigue
The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
* **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
* **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
* **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.

**Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.

**Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue. 

#### Obsessed 
The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.

#### Quickened
A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.
