## Vargraths
*Vampires Reduced To Bat-Like, Blood-Mad Monsters*<br>
**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** None <br>
Vampires’ ruthless and egotistical nature means that these undead rarely operate harmoniously with others of their kind. This competition is perhaps fiercest among those who occupy positions of nobility, for these cruel aristocrats are constantly scheming to ascend in rank and dispose of any dark lords or ladies who might compete for such lofty status. Such rivalries can escalate into brutal acts, committed until one party submits to the other, or is killed outright.

In their mercilessness, vampires often sentence their defeated foes to the most awful fates: being chained within stone, buried, or sealed away and forgotten. Such confinement is far worse than death, for the vampire becomes famished and hungers endlessly for blood, yet can never die of starvation. The body withers into a desecrated husk, and as the mind is flooded with nothing but thoughts of feeding, only the darkest primitive urges of the vampire remain.

Over long decades sealed away, whether in forgotten catacombs deep beneath the earth or in some forsaken countryside, such places are usually tainted with dark magic. This magic is drawn to the murderous yearning of the tormented prisoner and permeates its holding, turning it into a cocoon. Within, the vampire is slowly warped: corded muscles swell across its body, its face takes on chiropteran features, and bestial fangs sprout from its maw. Fingers extend, forming tough membranes between them. The stone prison begins to crack from the strain of the growing monstrosity within, until it finally falters, and a newly made Vargrath bursts forth.

These mutants are the hunger of a vampire made manifest. They exist only to gorge themselves on blood; not even hatred or malice remains of those who were condemned to this debased state. Such creatures are ceaseless hunters, constantly in search of fresh slaughter to partake in, swooping down in flurries to mutilate flesh and feast, halted only by the rising of the sun, at which point they crawl into the nearest dark recess to wait out the daylight hours.

Though physically mighty, the minds of Vargraths are weakened by their metamorphosis, making them easily bound into servitude by those skilled in the black arts. Many times, the vampire who first sealed away its rival may come to dominate the wretched spawn it helped create. In such cases, the beast is kept mystically sedated, roused only when its handler has an adversary who must be taught a particularly bloodied lesson.

### Forgotten Sinners
There lies a cursed ruin, concealed by a dread thicket of sharp-brambled, ancient, and defiled trees. Within are the remnants of former grandeur: ceilings broken open to the solemn skies, the tattered and burned remains of tapestries and paintings hanging forlorn from the walls, and elaborately engraved furnishings eroded by time, their shattered limbs strewn across floors thick with grime and ancient dust.

This ghastly place was once the abode of the most powerful bloodlines of vampires ever to rule, led by a vampiric master whose power surpassed any that the realm had borne witness to. His reign was one of terror, and the lands were forever scarred by his deeds, for all manner of undead abominations were wrought by his will. Chief among these were the vast hosts of vampires he sired, lords and ladies alike, each granted the dread gift of immortality by that dark figure, such creations serving his every nefarious whim.

The castle stood as a nexus of evil, drawing unto itself fell magics, lured by unholy rites and banquets of flesh held within its walls. Thus, the king’s influence corrupted the land, and his dominion spread as his empire grew, dreadfully proliferating with no knight nor champion of the light able to halt the ceaseless tide of ill.

Yet in time, such darkness came to ravage itself. For within the three greatest of his servants, creations of the master, there arose an ambition for power over even him. They came to desire freedom from their maker’s yoke and sought to bring about his end, that they might indulge their own iniquitous cravings unbound. Daring not confront him openly, they secretly sent word of his comings and goings to the holy orders of a neighboring kingdom.

And so it was that one night, as the vampiric sovereign journeyed through the dark wilderness, he was set upon by a band of crusaders, righteous and fearless, who descended upon his convoy without warning. Long and bitter was the struggle, yet at last the beast was worn down, and a blessed stake of silver was driven through his chest, smiting him utterly.

With pontifical glee, the children of the master celebrated their maker’s downfall, and anarchy fell upon the aristocracy. Villages were drained of their inhabitants and dragged away to serve as fodder for gluttonous banquets that lasted many weeks, amid decadent festivities and revolting excess. All order once enforced by the great master of the night was lost in a fevered haze. And yet, as such vile carousal continued unabated, the dark kingdom raised by the great father of vampires was slowly undone and cleansed by the efforts of the pious; for none among the young and heedless vampires possessed the will or strength to maintain so dread a dominion, each too enraptured by vice to assume such a mantle.

Yet the grand castle remained, for none could overcome the vast number of dark spawn that still infested its perilous halls, and the heathens within continued their revolting gaiety.

At last came an end to the traitors. It is said that one night, a hunched and macilent figure, swathed in a grey cloak with a face marked with scars, was seen by the shrouded villagers who dwelt long beneath the shadow of the great keep. Without hesitation, the figure passed toward the castle. That night, inhuman screams echoed through the trees, waking all who slept and causing even the dead who roamed the dark hours to pause. One by one, the damned cries rang out until the sun rose and the wails vanished with the coming of the light.

> ##### New Condition: Rampaging 
> The creature loses its free will as it enters a mindless Rampage. Rampages last for up to one minute and have the following effect on a creature unless an ability states otherwise: 
> * Any Charmed or Frightened effects on the creature are suspended.
> * The creature can't cast spells or maintain Concentration on spells or 
other effects.
> * On each of its turns, the creature must take the Attack action against the nearest hostile creature it can see within range. After attacking, it can't move for the rest of its turn. <br>
&emsp;**If no targets are within range,** it must move toward the nearest hostile creature it is aware of by the safest route. If it comes within range during this movement, it immediately takes the Attack action against it and can’t move further. <br>
&emsp;**If the target is still not within range after moving,** it must take the Dash action to continue approaching the nearest hostile creature.<br>
&emsp;**If the creature is prevented from moving within attack range,** it does whatever action is necessary to move within range (such as using an Action escape a net or break through a barrier).
> * The creature can only use its Reaction and Bonus Action to make attacks against hostile creatures or to move closer to the nearest hostile creature.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *Haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

When the bravest among the living dared to investigate, they found no count nor countess left within the walls; all had vanished. No time was wasted thereafter; the tainted edifice was toppled, and fire and iron were used to demolish all that stood above the ground.

Yet the vandals knew not what lay beneath the foundations they had undone. Vast catacombs wound deep into the earth: halls laden with ancient treasures, undead minions, and in the deepest recesses, multitudes of newly fashioned iron coffins, each carved with runes of binding and wrapped in heavy chains. Chiseled upon the lid of every such vessel was a single word in dark speech: “Traitor.”

Hundreds of years after its destruction, the rubble of the great vampire master is still shunned, for evil yet clings to that forgotten seat of power. And yet it is known that seekers of dark might still come to this place, combing the bones of the palace for secret halls below, braving the deep gloom in hopes of finding among the shadows the coffins that cradle the forgotten sinners within, for the terror bound there is a savagery few may withstand.

#### Vargrath Tactics
Vargraths rely on speed  high damage, not durability. They fly in and out of combat, targeting isolated or low AC foes. Once a Vargrath lands a bite, it becomes blood-crazed and commits fully to the attack,

##### Forgotten Sinner Tactics
Forgotten Sinners favor stealth and surprise. They ambush vulnerable targets, acting early due to high initiative. In the first round, their Primal Surge allows them to overwhelm or eliminate a foe before allies can react.
