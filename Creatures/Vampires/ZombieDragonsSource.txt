## Zombie Dragons
*Pestilent Draconic Corpses Reanimated By Dark Magic*<br>
**Habitat:** Underdark; **Treasure:** Any <br>
Through the horrid arts of necromancy, any creature, from the smallest rat to the mightiest lion, can be bound into servitude as a zombie, reduced to a mindless puppet that obeys its master without question. Even the most powerful and majestic of creatures are not spared in death, for dragons themselves are vulnerable to such magic.

A wizard truly skilled in the dark arts can animate the immense corpse of a fallen dragon, rousing it from eternal rest as a zombie dragon bound wholly to the caster’s will. These rotten behemoths are an affront to every sense. Once-lustrous scales are dulled and sloughing away in patches, exposing rotting muscle and bare bone beneath. The creature reeks of death, its putrid stench drawing swarms of voracious flies that blanket its decaying frame and churn endlessly through the air in a constant, repulsive hum.

Despite its disfigured state, a zombie dragon remains a devastating adversary. Fetid muscles still haul the creature skyward on tattered wings, while fangs and claws remain sharp enough to rend steel with ease. The torrents of flame it once breathed have been replaced by a corrupted miasma, a noxious mist that rots and decomposes all caught within it.

Such paragons of undeath are weapons of catastrophic power when guided by a nefarious necromancer, capable of shattering armies and slaying even the greatest of heroes. At other times, these abominations rise without a master at all, awakened when dark magic floods their graves. In such cases, the creature lumbers forward in blind slaughter, extinguishing all life that crosses its path.

### Zombie Dragon Tactics
The zombie dragon prioritizes Breath of Pestilence to affect multiple enemies, conserving its charges for repeated use. Between breaths, it relies on its other abilities to disrupt enemy formations and relentlessly pursue vulnerable targets.

#### Actions
The zombie dragon uses Multiattack to focus on enemies not yet afflicted with Rot. Throughout the battle, it seeks to spread Rot to as many targets as possible before concentrating its attacks on already-weakened foes.

#### Draconic Actions
* Use Breath of Pestilence immediately if it can affect three or more enemies, prioritizing creatures with low Constitution.
* Use Dread Presence if fewer than half of the enemies are Frightened.
* Use Cloud of Flies when enemies are clustered, forcing them to disperse. The zombie dragon willingly moves into the cloud, exploiting its immunity to gain protection.
* Use Tenacious Will only when the zombie dragon is unable to attack or is Incapacitated by an ongoing effect.
* Use Pounce as often as possible, targeting the enemy with the lowest Armor Class.

> ### Traits
>
> ***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces the zombie dragon to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to the damage taken), unless the damage is Radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, it drops to 1 hit point instead.
>
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The zombie dragon makes two Rend attacks. If both attacks hit the same target, that creature must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 19. <br>
> *Failure:* The target gains one level of Rot. <br>
> *Failure by 10+:* The target gains two levels of Rot.
>
> At the end of each of the creature’s turns, a creature with Rot takes 5 (1d10) Necrotic damage per level of Rot, then repeats the saving throw, removing all Rot on a success or gaining one additional level of Rot on a failure. An effect that removes disease or Exhaustion removes all levels of Rot.
>
> ***Rend.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <br>
> *Hit:* 11 (1d10 + 6) Slashing damage plus 5 (1d10) Necrotic damage.
>
> ### Draconic Actions
>
> The zombie dragon has 6 charges. On Initiative Count 15, 10, and 5, the zombie dragon gains 1 charge, up to a maximum of 6 charges. It can then spend charges to immediately take one of the following actions if it is not Incapacitated.
>
> ***Pounce (0 Charges).*** The zombie dragon moves up to half its speed and makes one Rend attack.
>
> ***Cloud of Flies (1 Charge).*** The zombie dragon creates a 15-foot-radius sphere of swarming flies centered on a point within 30 feet. The area is Lightly Obscured and Difficult Terrain for non-Undead creatures. The cloud lasts 1 minute or until dispersed by a wind of at least 10 mph.
>
> Each non-Undead creature that ends its turn in the area must make a *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 19. <br>
> *Failure:* 14 (4d6) Piercing damage. <br>
> *Failure by 10+:* The creature uses its movement to travel in a random direction (d8) until it exits the cloud. <br>
> *Success:* Half damage.
>
> ***Tenacious Will (1 Charge).*** If the zombie dragon is subject to an effect that allows a saving throw at the start or end of its turn, it can immediately make that saving throw with advantage, ending the effect on a success. This action can be taken even while Incapacitated.
>
> ***Terrifying Presence (2 Charges).*** *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC 19, each hostile creature within 120 feet. <br>
> *Failure:* The target is Frightened and can’t cast spells other than cantrips. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. <br>
> *Failure by 10+:* While Frightened, the creature can’t take reactions and must Dash each turn to move away by the safest available route.
>
> ***Breath of Pestilence (5 Charges).*** *Constitution Saving Throw:* DC 19, each creature in a 60-foot cone. <br>
> *Failure:* 21 (6d6) Necrotic damage and gain one level of Rot (described in the Multiattack action). <br>
> *Failure by 10+:* The target takes the full damage and gains two levels of Rot. <br>
> *Success:* Half damage only.
