## New Cantrip Invocations

The following is an expanded list of invocations for warlocks to choose from.  The invocations are all themed around allowing for specialization in cantrips other than *eldritch blast*. Some of these options replace existing invocations, meaning you cannot take both.

#### Agonizing Infusion 
*Prerequisite: A warlock cantrip that deals damage. (Replaces Agonizing Blast)*

When you pick this invocation, choose a warlock cantrip you know that deals damage.  When you damage a creature with the chosen cantrip, add your Charisma modifier to the damage dealt.  

Until you reach 5th level, this extra damage can only be applied to single creature damaged by the cantrip.  Beyond 5th level, this damage applies to all creatures damaged by the cantrip.


#### Cursed Touch
*Prerequisite*: chill touch *cantrip*

When you hit a creature with *Chill Touch*, the damage dice increase to d12s if that creature is cursed by one of your warlock spells, such as *Hex*,  or by a warlock feature of yours, such as Hexblade's Curse or Sign of Ill Omen.

Additionally, creatures affected by your *chill touch* are now considered to be cursed by you for the purposes of your other warlock features.

#### Echo of Death

#### Eldritch Reach
*Prerequisite: A warlock cantrip that either has a radius or a range greater than self. (Replaces Eldritch Spear)*

#### Specialized Poisons
*Prerequisite*: poison spray *cantrip*

At the end of each long rest, choose a creature type other than construct.  Creatures of the chosen creature type don't benefit from resistance or immunity to poison damage when targeted by your *poison spray* cantrip, unless they are under the effect of the *protection from poison* spell.

When you cast *sword burst*, you may make one melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

#### Spreading Flames
*Prerequisite*: bonfire *cantrip*

#### Swarm Intelligence

When you cast *infestation*, you can change its damage type to piercing.
