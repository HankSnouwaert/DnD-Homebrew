# New Artificer Infusions

#### Oil Slide Boots
*Item: A pair of boots (requires attunement)*

These boots can unleash flammable oil from their steps.  They have 4 charges, and their wearer can use a bonus action to expend a charge to slide 15 feet along the ground in a straight line without provoking attacks of opportunity.  Any space the wearer moves into or out of this way is covered in flammable fuel.  The fuel turns these areas into difficult terrain and lasts for 1 minute before drying up.  

If an attack, spell, or ability that deals fire damage targets something in a fuel-covered area or has an area of effect that overlaps with a fuel-covered area, any fuel in that area is set ablaze.  All other fuel-covered areas in contact with an area of burning fuel are also immediately set ablaze as the fire spreads across all the fuel it comes in contact with.

When a creature starts its turn in an area of burning fuel, it takes 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier fire damage.  A creature can only take damage from your burning fuel once during its turn.

The wearer of these boots ignores difficult terrain and is immune to fire damage caused by fuel created by these boots or any of your other artificer class features.

The boots regain 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Primordial Weapon
*Item: A simple or martial weapon*

This magic weapon deals an extra 1d4 damage on hit.  You choose the damage type from among the following when you infuse the item: acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder.

The extra damage increases to 1d6 when you reach 10th level in this class.

#### Quantum Coins
*Prerequisite: 10th-level artificer*<br>
*Item: A number of metallic coins less than or equal to your proficiency modifier*<br>
A creature with these coins can use each of them as a thrown weapon with the finesse property and a range of 30/60.  The coins deal no damage.  When you are using them, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack roll.  A creature being attacked by a coin that can see its attacker can choose to allow the attack to automatically hit.

When a creature throws the coin, that creature chooses a size from the Quantum Coin Sizes table.  If the thrown coin hits a creature or object, its size changes to the chosen size category for the next 10 minutes, and it gains the traits associated with that size, described in the Quantum Coin Sizes table.  An unwilling creature can make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to avoid changing size.  If it fails, it can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

Once a coin has been used to change the size of a target, it loses the ability to do so again until the next dawn.
