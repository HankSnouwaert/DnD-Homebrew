## General Magic Items
The following is a collection of magic items, ranging from niche and unique in their properties and usage to extremely simple and general purpose. They can be added in a variety of settings to give players straightforward magic utility options.


### Crystal Slippers
This enchanted glass footwear is crafted by mysterious fey lords and said to be gifted to young, lonely mortals under their care. These slippers are usually given as part of an arrangement that allows the recipient a chance to find romance, friendship, or reunite with a loved one. As deals with fey often have strict time windows, the slippers allow the wearer to move with supernatural speed. If one of the shoes is left behind, anyone who finds it can use it to find the original wearer, giving connections made during this time window a chance to be rekindled.

#### Crystal Slippers
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This footwear is made from an enchanted crystalline material with a glassy finish.  When you take the disengage action while wearing both slippers, you may also dash as a bonus action.

You can retain your attunement to the slippers even if you lose one, but both slippers are required for the initial attunement. 

A creature holding the lost slipper knows your location as if they cast the *locate creature* spell on you.

### Lucky Charm

Throughout the known world, members of nearly every race and walk of life will carry keepsakes they consider good luck.  Good luck charms come in many forms, from odd articles of clothing to bizarre  trinkets.  But the most common good luck charms tend to be small  tokens and pieces of jewelry.  

Sometimes these items are actually infused with magic that grants the wearer a stroke of good fortune when needed most.  These items may have been enchanted to bend the whims of fate, blessed by a cosmic being, or simply be hand-me-down curios that bring inexplicable luck to their wearers.  In any case, many superstitious adventurers never set out without their trusty lucky charms, which they swear have turned many certain death encounters into near misses.

#### Lucky Charm
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small charm can be attached to any piece of jewelry or clothing.  While wearing it, whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may roll an additional d20.  You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.  You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

If multiple creatures use a lucky charm or luck point granted by the Lucky feat on the same roll, they cancel out, resulting in no additional dice.

Once you use this feature, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn, and a creature that has used a lucky charm can't use another until it takes a long rest.

### Magic Hand Guards
While magical weapons are common across most worlds and are often used to boost the powers of martially inclined heroes, those who prefer hand-to-hand combat often have fewer options with magical weaponry. To counteract this, some arcane craftsmen create magical handguards that can be worn by those engaging in unarmed combat. These items can take on a variety of forms, from straps of cloth or leather to boxing gloves or even brass knuckles. 

#### Magic Hand Guards (+1/+2/+3)
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare(+3)*
These items are worn around one's hands and can take the form of straps of cloth or leather, boxing gloves, or even brass knuckles.  While wearing them, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes.  The bonus is determined by the item's rarity.

### Mox
A mox is an arcane gemstone associated with a particular type of magic determined by its material.  Mages can tap into the mox's power to boost the potency of a spell associated with its kind of magic.  
Moxes were originally created by wizards to aid students specializing in particular schools of magic.  But, they are <Br> now used by spellcasters of various backgrounds who wish <br> to focus their abilities on specific types of magic.

#### Mox
*Wonderous item, uncommon  (requires attunement)*

This gem contains power associated with a specific school of magic and can empower spells from that school.  When you cast a spell from the school of magic associated with the gem, you may use the gem to empower the spell, causing it to be cast at one level higher.  The gem can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The mox's material determines what school of magic it is associated with.

**Amber** - Conjuration

**Jet** - Necromancy

**Ruby** - Evocation

**Pearl** - Abjuration 

**Chrome** - Transmutation

**Opal** - Divination

**Emerald** - Enchantment

**Sapphire** - Illusion

### Rod of Magic Detection

These crystalline rods are sensitive to the presence of magic and can even differentiate between different types of arcane energy.  The color of the rod will change depending on the school of the magical effect it comes in contact with, and arcane detectives will often use these tools to aid them in their supernatural investigations.

#### Rod of Magic Detection 
*Rod, uncommon, 100g*

While holding this rod, you may use an action to touch a creature or object with it.  If the target bears any magic, the rod will glow with a color that varies depending on the school of magic it detects from the target.
