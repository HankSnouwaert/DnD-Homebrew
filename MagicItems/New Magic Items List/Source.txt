# New Magic Items

## Item Notes
### Magic Nets
Unless stated otherwise, a net loses its magical properties once a creature it has entangled is freed from it.

## A 

#### Anti-Magic Net 1.0.0
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), legendary (DC 19)*

A creature hit by this net must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on any ongoing spells and be unable to cast spells until the start of its next turn. At the start of each turn that it is restrained by the net, the creature must succeed on the same saving throw or be subjected to the effects again until the start of its next turn. The DC of this Concentration save is determined by the rarity of the net.

#### Armour of Wrath 1.0.0
*Armor (heavy), very rare, 6,000g*<br>

Forged in demonic flames and cooled in the blood of slain warriors, this crimson armor poses little hindrance to those whose hearts burn with rage.

#### Bank of Abundance 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon, 1,000g*

This item looks like a small clay animal with a slit on the top that is two inches wide. You may put any copper, silver, electrum, gold, or platinum coins into the bank using its slit. Any other type of object that is inserted is immediately spat back out. The bank can hold up to 500 pounds worth of coins. The bank weighs 2 pounds, regardless of its contents. 

You may use an action to retrieve coins from the back by holding it upside down and speaking the amount and type of coins you wish for, at which point the requested coins spill out of the bank, assuming they are contained within. The bank cannot release more than 50 coins at one time in this way.

If the bank is overloaded, pierced, or smashed, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.

#### Battle Anchor 1.0.0
*Harpoon spear, rare*

Only the mightiest of nautical warriors can wield this massive anchor. This weapon has the heavy and two handed properties, its attacks deal 2d6 piercing damage, and creatures wielding it must have a Strength of 14 or higher to make attacks with it without disadvantage. 

When you strike a creature with the anchor, you can choose not to tether it and instead deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing. If a creature dealt bludgeoning damage this way is Huge or smaller, it is knocked back 10 feet. 

Additionally, a Huge or smaller creature tethered by the anchor moves at half its speed. 

#### Beguiling Gem 1.0.0
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This entrancing gemstone can be incorporated into any piece of jewelry and glows with a pinkish hue that beguiles anyone who comes near it. While you are wearing this gem, any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you. While charmed this way, it is incapacitated. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if you are not within 5 feet of the creature at the end of any turn, if it takes any damage, or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor. Once the creature breaks free of the charm, it is immune to this item's effects for 1 hour.


#### Blade of Fate 1.0.0
*Weapon (any sword), rare, 2,000gp*<br>

Visions of future victories dance across this blade's reflective surface.  None know if it predicts fate or twists it.

At dawn each day, roll two d20s.  If you roll a 20 on either die, reroll it until you roll a different number.  Record the final results of each die.

When you make an attack roll with this weapon and roll one of the numbers you noted, you may treat the roll as if it were a 20.  You can only use each of the noted numbers once this way.  At dawn each day, you lose the numbers from the previous day.

#### Blade of Insight 0.0.0
*Weapon (any sword or axe), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This weapon's blade is made of ethereal, psychic energy. This weapon deals psychic damage instead of its normal damage type. Whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, you may learn your choice of the creature's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. You also learn if the creature is proficient with saving throws for the chosen attribute.

#### Blood Blade 1.0.0
*Weapon(greatsword), rare, 1,500g*<br>

This massive sword was forged with bloodthirsty instincts.  If a strike from this blade lands correctly, it will drink deep of its victim's life force.  

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.   

Additionally, when you roll the damage dice for an attack you make with the weapon, if at least two of the damage dice roll the same result, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage.  If both of these damage dice roll the same result, repeat this process until both dice don't roll the same result.


#### Brass Orb 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, legendary*

This small, whirling, clockwork contraption of brass can be activated to tear through the fabric of reality. As an action, a creature can activate the device, causing it to start humming loudly. At the start of the creature's next turn, the device is destroyed, opening a gateway to a realm of pure chaos and untold destruction. A 30-foot-radius sphere of chaotic shifting colors appears centered at the point where the device was destroyed. 

The sphere lasts for 1 minute and is filled with indescribable noises that can be heard up to 100 feet away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the sphere's area, and creatures fully within it are blinded and deafened. A creature moving through this area must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.

At the start of the turn of the creature who activated the orb, the sphere's radius expands by 10 feet, and any nonmagical object that is not being worn or carried in the area takes 10d12 force damage. Any creature that enters the sphere's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. It takes 10d12 force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature or object reduced to 0 hit points by the sphere is disintegrated and sucked into the chaotic rift. A creature killed this way can be brought back to life only by means of a *true resurrection* or a *wish* spell.

\pagebreakNum

#### Bracers of the Last Stand 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon*

These rugged bracers give off a subtle heat you can feel in your soul. If the end draws near, they will fill you with determination, preventing you from falling.  

If damage would reduce you to 0 hit points while wearing these bracers, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the damage taken.  On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point.  Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.

Additionally, if you are wearing these bracers while at 1 hit point, your hands burn and glow, shedding bright light out 15 feet and dim light an additional 15 feet.  While your hands are glowing this way, your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 fire damage.

\pagebreakNum


## C

#### Carnage Axe 1.0.0
*Weapon (any axe), very rare, 9,000gp*<br>
This unholy axe has been forged from bloodsoaked brass fused with demonic souls.  Ever eager for combat, the souls are roused when they sense multiple enemies nearby.

#### Cloak of Daggers 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This cloak is capable of transforming shadows into deadly blades. While you are wearing this cloak in dim light or darkness, you may use a bonus action to draw a dagger from within the shadows of the cape. This dagger is a magic weapon that deals psychic damage rather than piercing. If you drop the dagger, it dissipates. If you use the dagger to make a thrown weapon attack, the dagger dissipates after the attack is resolved. You can only have two daggers drawn from this cloak at a time.

#### Club of Savagery 0.0.0
*Weapon (club), uncommon*

This club has a Savagery Count, which determines the damage die it uses. Whenever you hit a creature with this club, the Savagery Count increases by 1. At the start of each of your turns, if it has been over a minute since you've hit a creature with this weapon, its Savagery Count is reset to 0. The table below determines the damage die used for the club based on its Savagery Count.

| Savagery Count  |  Damage Die      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  0          | 1d4 |

***Curse.*** Once you don this collar, you can't doff it unless it is targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While wearing the collar, you can't cast or concentrate on spells. You are also not affected by spells unless they would damage you, force you to make a saving throw, reduce your movement speed, or inflict other negative effects.

#### Combat Angler's Fishing Rod 1.0.0
*Harpoon spear, rare*

This weapon takes the form of an enchanted fishing pole. As an action, you can add rope to the pole, which then automatically creates a fishing hook at the end.

This weapon functions like a normal harpoon spear with the following exceptions:

* Ranged attacks made with this weapon are made by throwing the fishing hook out at targets rather than throwing the weapon itself, though it can still only tether one target at a time and can't be used to make attacks while it is tethering a target.
* The distances for ranged attacks made with this weapon increase to 60/200. 
* Melee attacks made with this weapon deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing and cannot tether targets.  
* Whenever a creature you can see makes a bite attack, you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it with this weapon. If this attack hits, the creature has disadvantage on the bite attack. You cannot make this attack if you already have a creature tethered with the pole.

#### Chromatic Tome 1.0.0
*Wonderous item, very rare, 12,000gp (requires attunement)*

This tome serves as a prison for a sorcerous demon and offers great power to those willing to assume terrible risks.

While attuned to this book, you can read from its pages to gather the winds of magic.  This can be done as a bonus action or whenever you roll for initiative.  When you do so, the book gains 2d6 charges which last for 1 minute or until you expend them.  If you roll a 2, you gain no charges and must roll on the Miscast Table below to determine what kind of magical backlash you suffer. 

You can't roll for charges again until you spend 10 minutes studying its pages, which can do during a short or long rest.

While the book has charges, you can expend 3 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17,  attack bonus of +9), using it as your spellcasting focus: *chromatic orb* (3 charges), *scorching ray* (4 charges), *shatter* (4 charges), *lightning bolt* (6 charges) *hunger of hadar* (6 charges), *wall of fire* (7 charges).


 ##### Miscast Table
| 2d6 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  | Miscast Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  2  |    Fiendish limbs tear through reality and pull you into a demonic realm of torment.  Your body is destroyed, and your soul and physical belongings are transported to a layer of the Abyss in possession of a demon lord of the DM's choosing.  |
|  3-4  |  You violently discharge arcane energy, dealing 10d6 force damage to you and each creature within 15 feet of you.|
|  5-6  |   The treacherous demon trapped within the book gives its aid elsewhere.  For the next minute, a creature of the DM's choosing within 100 feet of you gains the ability to cast spells as though it were holding the tome with 12 charges available.|
|  7  |  You take 4d6 necrotic damage and can't cast spells until the start of your next turn.|
|  8-9 |    A massive vortex drains all the magic in the area.  You take 8d6 force damage, and all spells with 100 feet of you are dispelled as though targeted by *dispel magic* cast at 9th level.|
|  10-11  | Your mind is ravaged by demons, causing you to be under the effects of the *feeblemind* spell for the next 10 minutes.|
| 12  | The book becomes overloaded,  gaining 12 charges.  Until it loses these charges, spell attack rolls made as part of casting spells from the book are made with advantage, and all creatures have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make against a spell cast from the book.  The book can't regain charges for the next 1d4 days.|

## D

#### Dualist's Standard 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon*

#### Echanted Carriage 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, rare, 5,000gp*

This item appears to be an ordinary pumpkin. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the pumpkin to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, it turns into a full-sized carriage. If the space where the carriage would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the carriage, the pumpkin fails to transform. 

When this pumpkin becomes a carriage, you may turn two willing creatures within 60 feet of it into riding horses as though under the effects of the *polymorph* spell. They remain transformed this way until the carriage returns to its pumpkin form.

The item remains as a carriage for 3 hours, after which it reverts to its pumpkin form. It reverts to a pumpkin early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it.

This clear scimitar is made from a glassy material rather than metal, and you may use a free action to cause it to ignite with translucent flames and turn invisible. The only indication of the blade's presence while invisible is a shimmering outline in the form of the scimitar. The weapon still has a physical form and can be picked up and held like any other scimitar. However, it takes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check for those not attuned to the blade to notice its presence while it is invisible.  

The sword deals fire damage instead of slashing, ignoring resistances and immunities. You may use a free object interaction to turn the weapon visible again. The scimitar will turn visible if it is not being carried or held by you for more than an hour.

When you do so, you must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw.  You get +2 to the result for each form of long-term madness you are suffering from.  On a success, you regain one use of your Bardic Inspiration feature.  On a failure, you gain one random form of long-term madness, which lasts for the next hour.

*Wonderous item, legendary, 75,000gp*

This small glass bead contains a glimmering, multicolored light.

You may use your action to speak the bead's command word, releasing the light within. Doing so grants you the benefits of a long rest and neutralizes any poisons, diseases, or curses afflicting you. Once the light has been released, this item becomes an ordinary glass bead.

#### Lucky Charm 1.0.0
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small charm can be attached to any piece of jewelry or clothing.  While wearing it, whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may roll an additional d20.  You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.  You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

If multiple creatures use a lucky charm or luck point granted by the Lucky feat on the same roll, they cancel out, resulting in no additional dice.

This rune is engraved into a small piece of material, such as cloth, leather, bone, or stone. You may read the rune aloud as an action, causing the item to disintegrate. After doing so, you may add 2d4 to the next skill check you make within the next minute.  

You can wait to add the 2d4 until after you make the roll for the check and after applying other modifiers from other spells and abilities, such as the *guidance* spell or Bardic Inspiration. However, you must decide to use this bonus before the DM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

## S

#### Self-Reeling Harpoon Gun 1.0.0
*Harpoon gun, uncommon (+1, +2, or +3 Str Mod), rare (+4 Str Mod), or very rare (+5 Str Mod)*

The harpoon gun contains a magical pully system that reels in tethered targets at the wielder's command. When you make an opposed Strength check against a creature tethered with this weapon to pull it or avoid being pulled by it, you can apply the weapon's modifier rather than your Strength modifier to the check. The value of the weapon's modifier depends on its rarity.

#### Shadow Net 1.0.0
*Net, rare*

Creatures restrained by this net are blinded unless they have the ability to see through magical darkness as cloying shadows cover their eyes.

#### Shining Armor 0.0.0
*Armor (medium or heavy armor made from metal), uncommon*

This metal armor shines so brightly that its wearer only appears to be a bright glare to those observing from a distance. While wearing it, any attacks made against you from over 80 feet away are made with disadvantage. 



#### Smoldering Garrote 0.0.0
*Weapon (garrote), uncommon, (requires attunement)*

This garrote is made from leather that looks like it was recently burned. When used to attack a creature, the garrote fills its victim's lungs with smoldering fumes.

When a creature ends its turn grappled by the garrote, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 1d8 fire damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage. Creatures that do not need to breathe are immune to this effect.

#### Spell Bow 0.0.0
*Weapon (any bow or crossbow), Rare*

When you use your attack action to make a ranged weapon attack with this weapon, you may use your bonus action to cast a cantrip you know with a casting time of one action or bonus action. 

#### Spore Slinger 0.0.0
*Weapon (sling), uncommon, (requires attunement)*

This sling has mold growing all over it. It has 3 charges and regains 1 charge every hour.

When you make an attack with this sling, you may expend a charge, and if the attack hits, you may add one of the effects listed below to the attack. The save DC for these effects is 13.

**Blinding Spore** - The creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.

**Toxic Spore** - The creature must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 1d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**Dazing Spore** - The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be incapacitated until the end of your next turn.


#### Staff of Change 1.0.0
*Staff, very rare, 15,000gp (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*<br>

This staff infuses spells with the raw powers of chaos, inflicting random mutations on its victims.

While holding this staff, the save DC of all your spells increases by +1.

Additionally, when one or more creatures fail a saving throw against a spell you cast of 3rd level or higher while wielding this staff, you can choose one of those creatures and cause it to suffer a random mutation determined by the Mutation Table below.  At the end of each of the target's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw against the spell's save DC, ending all mutations affecting it on a success.  A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation | Creature Effect |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded and has blindsight with a radius of 5 feet.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight.   At the start of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|


#### Stalkers Lens 0.0.0
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

While wearing this eyepiece, your eyes appear bestial in nature. When you cast the spell *hunter's mark* while wearing this eyepiece, it no longer requires concentration. You may only have one instance of the spell active at a time.

#### Storm Trident 0.0.0
*Weapon (trident), uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

You may use this trident as your spell focus.

When you cast a cantrip that deals damage using the trident as a spell focus while holding it with two hands, you may change the cantrip's damage type to cold, lightning, or thunder.

## T 

#### Threading Needle 1.0.0
*Harpoon spear, rare*

This giant magical sewing needle is said to have been crafted by eccentric fey lords. When you tether a creature with this weapon, the needle pierces through the target, and if you have a free hand, you may have it automatically fly back to that hand while keeping the target tethered with magical thread. 

Maintaining the tether still occupies one of your hands. However, you can tether additional creatures with this needle, and each tether made with the needle can be maintained with the same hand. The needle deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage per creature it is tethering. 

Each tethered creature must still stay within 60 feet of you to maintain the tether. If a tethered creature succeeds on a check to pull you by the tether, rather than pull you or snap the tether, it magically moves through the thread and frees itself. 

If the tether is cut, each tethered creature is freed. You may use an action to reapply a rope to the needle, which turns the rope into more magical thread.

#### Toxic Net 1.1.0
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), or legendary (DC 19)*

These nets are woven with vines that release poisonous aerosols when destroyed. If the net is snapped or destroyed with slashing damage, each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Consitution saving throw, with the DC determined by the net's rarity. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. 

A creature poisoned this way can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

The net doesn't lose its magical properties until it is destroyed this way.

## U

#### Underworld Skewers 1.0.0
*Harpoon spear, rare (requires attunement)*

These ghastly harpoons are said to be forged in the underworld and made for hunting wayward spirits. The harpoons come in a set of 10 that are all bound to a quiver. To attune to them, you must be in possession of the quiver, and while attuned, you can use an action to cause all the harpoons to reappear in their quiver.

These harpoons can tether incorporeal creatures normally immune to the grappled condition, and the tethers attached to these harpoons take on a ghostly quality and cannot be cut, though they can still be snapped through Strength checks. 

While one or more of these harpoons are impaled in any creatures within 60 feet of you, you may use an action to call all the harpoons back, causing them to rip themselves free and deal their weapon damage to the creatures they were impaling before flying back to their quiver. The harpoons phase through all obstacles to reach their quiver.

#### Unfathomable Tome 1.0.0
*Wonderous item, very rare, 8,000gp (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This demonic text offers wizards a seemingly endless amount of arcane knowledge, though plumbing its depths risks one's sanity.

This book can be used as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and while you are carrying it, you can speak and write in Abyssal.  The book functions as a spellbook for you, and the gold and time you must spend to copy spells into it is halved.  Spells from this book cannot be copied into other spellbooks.

Additionally, you may spend an hour studying the book to uncover its secrets.  When you do so, name three different spells from the wizard spell list that are all the same spell level.  These must be spells you have previously seen cast or read in texts such as spellbooks or spell scrolls.  Label these spells 1 through 3.  Roll a d4 and add the spell whose number matches the result to your spellbook.  On a roll of 4, you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spells.  On a failure, you gain a random long-term madness effect for the number of days equal to the level of the chosen spells.  The book can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

When this book becomes unattuned to a creature, all the spells it contains are lost.

## W

####  Wand of Whimsy 1.0.0
*Wand, very rare, 24,000gp (requires attunement by a spellcaster)* <br> 

This wand was carved from demonic bones and is capable of reducing its victims into writhing beasts of chaotic flesh.

While holding this wand, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls.

When you attack a small or larger creature with a spell attack and roll a 20 on the attack roll while holding this wand, that target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw.  On a failure, the creature dies and its body turns into a **blue horror of change** under your control.  An additional **blue horror of change** is created for each size category above medium the creature was.  

Any **blue horror of change** and any **brimstone horrors of change** they spawn share your initiative count.   They take their turns immediately after yours in any order, and they obey your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don't issue any commands, the horrors spend their turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of their abilities.  Any horrors made this way melt into goo after 1 minute.  

A creature killed this way can only be revived by a *true resurrection* or *wish* spell.

#### Warp Stone Token 1.0.0
*Wonderous item, rare, 200g*

While in possession of one or more warp stone tokens, you can use an action to eat any number of tokens to regain one expended spell slot of your choice. If the expended slot level is higher than the number of tokens eaten, the new slot level is equal to the number of tokens eaten. You must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking an amount of necrotic damage based on the number of tokens eaten on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This damage and hit point maximum reduction can't be reduced or prevented in any way except by succeeding on the saving throw, and it lasts until you finish a long rest.

The amount of necrotic damage taken and DC of the saving throw depend on the number of tokens eaten, as shown in the Warp Stone Token Table below.

##### Warp Stone Token Table 
| Number of Tokens  | Save DC |  Damage  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  | 13 | 2d6|
|  2  | 14 | 4d6|
|  3  | 16 | 6d6|
|  4  | 17 | 7d6|
|  5  | 19 | 9d6|
|  6  | 22 | 12d6|
|  7  | 23 | 13d6|
|  8  | 24 | 14d6|
|  9  | 27 | 17d6|


#### Wind Cord 0.0.0
*Weapon (garrote), uncommon*

This garrote is made from nearly weightless material. While grappling a creature with it, you can use a bonus action to have the wind cord continue grappling the creature even if you let go of it.  

While not being held by you, the wind cord uses your Strength modifier for opposed grapple checks, though it does not benefit from any of your proficiency bonuses. If the grappled creature escapes from the chord's grapple, the chord becomes inert and falls to the ground.

While not being held by you, other creatures may target the wind chord with attacks. The wind chord has an AC of 13 and immunity to poison and psychic damage. If 15 or more damage is dealt to it, it releases the creature it is grappling and falls to the ground.

#### Whispersilk Cloak 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon*

While wearing this cloak, you can turn invisible as an action, and anything you are wearing or carrying turns invisible with you. You remain invisible until the cloak is removed, you are moved from your location, you are hit by an attack, or you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to do anything that requires you to move or make hand gestures.

#### Wit Stealer Sword 1.0.0
*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This sword slashes through mind and body.  Its attacks deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage.  At the end of each of your turns, all creatures who have been struck at least twice by this sword since the start of your turn must make DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of the *confusion* spell until the end of their next turn.  A creature that has suffered this effect from the sword is immune to it for the next hour.
