## Sacred Magic <br> Items of War
Religious organizations often safeguard relics tied to important figures and events within their order's history. Other items are the result of intricate blessings from many powerful figures within the church and may serve as symbols of authority. For faiths focused on war and rooting out evil, these relics often take the form of weapons and armaments of battle. The following magic items are examples of magic items that may be carried by religious orders with a more militeristic bent.

#### Hammer of Judgement
*Weapon (Warhammer), rare (requires attunement by a paladin), 16,000 gp*

*This mighty hammer, wielded by an ancient king to purge evil from his realm, is sanctified by his indomitable spirit. Imbued with a fragment of his eminent power, it unleashes devastating force in the hands of those who uphold the king’s righteous tenets.*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The hammer has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: *searing smite* (1 charge), *branding smite* (2 charges), *blinding smite* (3 charges), *staggering smite* (4 charges), or *banishing smite* (5 charges).

The hammer regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

#### Jade Amulet
*Wondrous item, rare (requires <br> attunement by a paladin), 5,000 gp*

*Carved by the first warrior to swear the Oath of the Ancients, this ancient jade amulet hums with primal life force. Its wearer is suffused with regenerative power, healing wounds with verdant energy.*

While wearing this amulet, whenever you heal another creature with your Lay on Hands feature, you gain hit points equal to half the amount healed (rounded down).

#### Maul of Divine Wrath
*Weapon (Maul), very rare (requires attunement), 24,000 gp*

*This twin-headed maul, once wielded by the first priest of a righteous warrior god, radiates sacred power. In the hands of a devoted champion of good, its heads glow like comets, striking with the force of a falling star.*

When you take the Attack action, you can forgo any extra attacks to empower the maul for a single attack. If you forgo at least one extra attack, the attack gains a +3 bonus to attack rolls and deals an extra 3d6 Radiant damage on a hit. Additionally, the attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 17–20.

#### Slayer’s Hourglass
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement), 3,000 gp*

*This small hourglass has saved countless monster slayers from gruesome fates. As its sands flow, the claws and jaws of monstrosities slow, as if mired in tar, when the hunter locks eyes with their quarry.*

While wearing this amulet, whenever a creature under the effect of your *hunter’s mark* spell or Favored Foe feature makes an attack against you, it rolls a d6 and subtracts the result from the attack roll. Additionally, whenever the creature forces you to make a Dexterity saving throw, you may roll a d6 and add the result to your saving throw.

#### Staff of Command
*Weapon (Quarterstaff), rare (requires attunement by a paladin), 6,000 gp*

*A symbol of authority among a grand order of paladins, this staff channels heavenly strength. Its wielder enforces righteous law with powerful magic drawn from divine realms.*

This quarterstaff can be used as a holy symbol and grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +1 bonus to the saving throw DCs of your paladin spells, Channel Divinity options, and your Aura of Protection.

#### Sword of Righteous Steel
*Weapon (Longsword), rare (requires attunement), 2,000 gp*

*Forged from the finest steel and blessed by a conclave of paladins, this holy blade amplifies the divine might of hallowed warriors. Its sanctified edge delivers blows capable of felling the most wicked creatures.*

Whenever you cast a smite spell immediately after hitting a target with this weapon, the spell’s effective level increases by 1.

#### Witch Hunter’s Talisman
*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement), 30,000 gp*

*This strange trinket, crafted by those who stalk practitioners of the dark arts, is the most powerful of its kind. The fetish dampens lethal hexes and incantations, shielding the hunter from malignant spells.*

While wearing this talisman, you gain the following benefits against a creature affected by your *hunter’s mark* spell or Favored Foe feature:

* You have advantage on saving throws against spells that creature casts.
* That creature has disadvantage on spell attack rolls made against you.
* If the creature casts a spell that allows you to make a saving throw to take half damage, you instead take no damage on a successful save and half damage on a failed save.

#### Icon of the Pious
*Wondrous item (holy symbol), very rare (requires attunement by a paladin), 10,000 gp*

*This ancient relic, carried by a legendary warrior whose heroic deeds carved a path of glory, bolsters the spirit of those in its presence. When held by a hero in the making, it fortifies their resolve against any hardship.*

When you or a creature within your Aura of Protection is subjected to an effect that allows a Wisdom, Intelligence, or Charisma saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage on a successful save and half damage on a failed save.

#### Slayer’s Stake
*Weapon (Dagger), rare (requires attunement by a paladin), 3,000 gp*

*Passed down through generations of vampire slayers, this ancient wooden stake has reduced countless undead and demons to dust. Its weathered tip pierces the withered hearts of bloodthirsty beasts with unerring precision.*

This weapon deals an additional 1d4 Radiant damage on a hit, and attacks made with it score a critical hit on a roll of 19–20. When you score a critical hit with this weapon, it deals an additional 10 Radiant damage. If the target is a Fiend or Undead, it deals an additional 30 Radiant damage instead. If this critical hit reduces a fiend or undead to 0 hit points, the target is destroyed and turned to ash.

#### Sacred Brand
*Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon, 300 gp*

*Crafted from pure silver, cooled in holy water, and etched with prayers to vanquish evil, this sacred ammunition delivers merciless divine judgment. When it strikes a creature of darkness, it ignites them in white-hot flames, reducing even hell’s minions to purified ash.*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical. If the target is a Fiend or Undead, it begins Burning*, taking 2d6 Radiant damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends.


#### Silvered Gravesalt
*Adventuring gear, uncommon, 10 gp*

*This potent mixture, when scattered upon the ground, forms a barrier that impedes otherworldly entities, impeding any fiend or spirit that attempts to tread past its sanctified boundary.*

As an action, you can spread a single bag of gravesalt to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any Celestial, Elemental, Fey, Fiend, or Undead that attempts to enter the area must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, it can’t enter the area for the rest of the turn, its speed becomes 0, and it takes 3d6 Force damage.

#### White Cloak of The Wolf God
*Wondrous item (cloak), rare (requires attunement by a paladin), 8,000 gp*

*Fashioned from the pelt of a ferocious winter wolf and blessed by a warlord sworn to the god of the winter hunt, this cloak radiates bone-chilling cold. It allows its wearer to lead allies through the fiercest blizzards, confounding foes unprepared for its icy aura.*

You and your allies have resistance to Cold damage while within your Aura of Protection. Additionally, hostile creatures treat your Aura of Protection as difficult terrain unless they are resistant or immune to Cold damage.

<Br>

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
