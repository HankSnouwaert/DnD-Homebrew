## Ratfolk Packmaster <br> Magic Items

These items are often magical versions of ninja weaponry or items that enhance the user's ability to sneak and carry out assassination or hit-and-run attacks. They are jealously coveted by the ratfolk ninja clans and highly sought after by thieves and assassins of other races. (NOTE: You didn't copy any descriptions from Warhammer, right?)


#### Hex Lash
*Whip, rare (requires attunement), 2,000gp*

This whip is studded with magical stones, and its talon-like strikes seem to have an unnaturally long reach.

The whip has a reach of 15 feet, you gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it, and it deals an extra 2d4 slashing damage to any target it hits. 


#### Whip of Domination
*Whip, rare (requires attunement), 5,000gp*

This whip is crafted from minotaur leather soaked in the stomach acid of vile trolls. It exudes an aura of dread and command.

**Reach:** This whip has a reach of 15 feet.

**Dominating Strike:** When you hit a creature with this whip, you can choose another creature you can see (NOTE: Why another creature?). The chosen creature can use its reaction to end any charmed or frightened conditions affecting it, then it must move up to half its speed and make one weapon attack against the target of your whip strike. If it does not use this reaction, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. While frightened, the creature cannot cast spells other than cantrips. A creature can only be affected by this feature of the whip once per turn.

#### Creature Killer 
*Things catcher, rare (requires attunement), 5,000gp*

This item consists of an iron collar attached to a long pole, specifically designed to capture and control dangerous creatures.

**Grasping Iron:** The DC to escape grapples from Creature Killer is 16, it can grapple creatures that are Huge or smaller, and creatures grappled by it are restrained.

**Subdue The Mighty:** Once per turn, when you hit a grappled creature by Creature Killer with Creature Killer, its damage dice changes to match the largest hit dice of the target creature for that attack.

#### Electro-Grabber
*Things catcher, rare (requires attunement), 3,000gp*

This polearm features wires running its length, culminating in a metal collar designed to grasp and control creatures. Noncompliant creatures can expect a severe electrical punishment.

**Charges:** The Electro-Grabber has 5 charges.
**Grasping Shock:** A creature grappled by the Electro-Grabber must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to break free. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to deal 5d8 lightning damage to a creature grappled by the weapon.
**Recharging:** The Electro-Grabber regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.



#### Electro-Whip
*Whip, rare (requires attunement), 3,000gp*

Forged from an unusual metal, this whip features a small switch on its handle. When activated by an attuned user, the whip crackles with electricity.

**Charges:** The Electro-Whip has 5 charges.
**Electric Lash:** At the start of your turn, you can expend 1 charge to enhance the whip. Until the end of your turn, attacks made with the whip gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and deal an additional 2d4 + 1 lightning damage to any target they hit.

**Recharging:** The Electro-Whip regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.


#### Foulhide 
*Leather armor, rare (requires attunement), 8,000gp*

Fashioned from the skin of a rat ogre and treated with potent alchemical agents, this malodorous armor clings to its wearer like a second skin, enhancing their physical endurance.

**Constitution Enhancement:** While wearing this armor, your Constitution score increases to 18, unless it is already 18 or higher without the armor.
**Unnatural Bond:** Once attuned, the armor cannot be removed voluntarily, and you cannot end your attunement without assistance. Another creature proficient with Leatherworker’s Tools can attempt to remove the armor by spending one uninterrupted hour on the task. At the end of this hour, they must make a DC 18 Intelligence (Medicine) check. On a success, the armor is successfully removed, and attunement ends. Regardless of success or failure, the removal process is physically taxing, and you suffer 1d3 + 1 levels of exhaustion.

> ##### Controlling a Transformed Rat Ogre
>
> When a creature is transformed into a rat ogre using the Growth Juice, it retains its autonomy and can act according to its own will. The behavior of the transformed creature towards the players can be influenced by how they treated the animal before its transformation. For example, players might use the spell *speak with animals* to promise a reward, or they may need to succeed on a high Animal Handling check to gain the creature's trust.
