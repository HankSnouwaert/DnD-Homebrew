## Mox
A mox is an arcane gemstone associated with a particular type of magic determined by its material.  Mages can tap <br> into the mox's power to boost the potency of a spell associated with its kind of magic.  
Moxes were originally created by wizards to aid students specializing in particular schools of magic.  But, they are <br> now used by spellcasters of various backgrounds who <br> wish to focus their abilities on specific types of magic.

#### Mox
*Wonderous item, uncommon  (requires attunement)*

This gem contains power associated with a specific <br> school of magic and can empower spells from that school.  When you cast a spell from the school of magic associated with the gem, you may use the gem to empower the spell, causing it to be cast at one level higher.  The gem can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The mox's material determines what school of magic it <br> is associated with.

**Jet** - Necromancy

**Pearl** - Abjuration
