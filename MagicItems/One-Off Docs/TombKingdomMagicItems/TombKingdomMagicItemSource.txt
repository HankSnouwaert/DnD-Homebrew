## Tomb Kingdom Magic Items

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word
*Scroll, Add gp cost*<br>
As a reaction to seeing a spell being cast with a verbal component, you can draw this scroll and read its incantations in an attempt to prevent its casting. The caster must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fails and has no effect as the caster's mouth is filled with biting scarabs, which deal Xd6 piercing damage per level of the spell that was being cast and prevent the caster from speaking until the start of their next turn.

#### Enkil's Kanopi
*Wonderous Item, Add gp cost*<br>
As an action, you can open the lid of the kanopi, causing it to emit a swirling vortex that attempts to absorb any magic in the area. Every creature, object, and magical effect with 30 ft. is subjected to the effects of *dispel magic*. Spells caught in this area that are higher than 3rd level are unaffected. For every 2 effects dispelled this way, you can regain a 1st level spell slot.

Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until dawn of the following day.

Some rarer kanpoi can provide more potent effects, allowing them to dispel more powerful effects and grant their users higher-level spell slots.

##### Kanopi Levels
| Level of *Dispel Magic* Effect  | Level of Spell Slots Regained| gp Cost |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  3  |  1 | add gp | 
|  4  | 1  | add gp |
|  5  | 1 |  add gp|
|  6  | 2 | add gp |
|  7  | 2 | add gp|
|  8  | 2 | add gp|
|  9  | 3 | add gp|

**NOTE:** Still not sure on the right balance for regaining spell slots

#### Amulet of Pha-Stah
*Wonderous Item, (requires attunement) Add gp cost*<br>
While wearing this amulet, all magic items within 5 ft. of you are subjected to the effects of the *antimagic field* spell. This effect also applies to magic items being worn or carried by creatures within 5 ft. of you.

#### Callar of Sapesh
*Wonderous Item, Add gp cost*<br>
When you take damage while wearing this collar, you can use your reaction to choose a willing creature within 10 feet to take the damage instead. The damage that the creature takes can't be negated or resisted in any way.

#### Vambraces of the Sun
*Wonderous Item, Add gp cost*<br>
As a reaction to someone you can see making an attack, you can use one of these bracers to shoot a beam of light at them, blinding the attacker for the duration of the attack. Each bracer can use this ability once (allowing you two uses in total) and can't do so again until dawn of the next day.

#### Hieratic Jar
*Wonderous Item, Add gp cost*<br>
As part of an action or bonus action being used to cast a spell of 1st level, you can open the lid of the kanopi (this can be done as part of any somatic components the spell has.) The kanopi unleashes its arcane energy and boosts the level the spell is being cast at to 2nd level. 

Once the jar is used this way, it crumbles to dust.

Some rarer jars can provide more potent effects, allowing them to boost spells to even higher levels. Any spell cast at a lower level than the jar's level is boosted to that spell level when using the jar. For example, when using a 5th level jar, any spell cast at 4th level or lower is boosted to 5th level.

##### Jar Levels
| Jar Level  |  gp Cost |
|:---:| :---------:|
|  2  | add gp | 
|  3  |  add gp |
|  4  | add gp|
|  5  |add gp |
|  6  |  add gp|
|  7  | add gp|
|  8  |  add gp|
|  9  |  add gp|
