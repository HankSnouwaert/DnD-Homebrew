# Gifts of Rage
Powerful demons or barbarian <br> tribes of war and rage will <br> sometimes craft magical items <br> which channel their bloodthirsty <br> powers.  They may wield these items themselves or gift them to worthy <br> warriors.  The following magic <br> items can be used to represent these gifts of <br> rage in your campaign.

#### Armour of Wrath
*Armor (heavy), very rare*<br>

Forged in demonic flames and cooled in the <br> blood of slain warriors, this crimson armor poses <br> little hindrance to those whose hearts burn with rage.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this  armor. 

Additionally, if you have at least three levels in the barbarian class, you are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with heavy armor, and you retain the full benefits of your Rage and Fast Movement barbarian class features while wearing this armor.

#### Blood Blade
*Greatsword, rare*<br>

This massive sword was forged with bloodthirsty instincts.  If a strike from this blade lands correctly, it will drink deep of its victim's life force.  

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.   

Additionally, when you roll the damage dice for an attack you make with the weapon, if at least two of the damage dice roll the same result, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage.  If both of these damage dice roll the same result, repeat this process until both dice don't roll the same result.


#### Carnage Axe
*Weapon (any axe), very rare*<br>
This unholy axe has been forged from bloodsoaked brass fused with demonic souls.  The souls, ever eager for combat, are roused when they sense multiple enemies nearby.

You have advantage on attack rolls made with this weapon as long as there are two or more hostile creatures within 5 feet of you that aren't incapacitated.

#### Collar of Scorn
*Wondrous item, legendary*<br>
This brass collar is inscribed with powerful runes that ward off all magic that would target the wearer, as well as any magic the wearer would attempt to utilize.

While wearing this collar, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, spell attacks have disadvantage against you, and you have resistance to damage from spells.

***Curse.*** Once you don this collar, you can't doff it unless it is targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While wearing the collar, you can't cast or concentrate on spells. You are also not affected by spells unless they would damage you, force you to make a saving throw, reduce your movement speed, or inflict other negative effects.

#### Mask of the Destroyer
*Wondrous item, legendary*<br>

This fearsome mask of brass aids its wearer in bloody murder, but those who fail to appease its bloodlust are punished harshly.

When you take the attack action, You may choose to make one additional attack with the action.

At the end of a turn in which you activated the mask, if you have not killed or reduced a creature to 0 hit points this turn with a weapon attack, you take 6d6 necrotic damage. 
This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.
