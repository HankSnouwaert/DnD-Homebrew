# Tomb Kingdom <br> Magic Items

The priests and artisans of Tomb Kingdoms produced countless magical items during their empire's heyday. These relics now linger in the crumbling ruins dotted throughout their realm. Many leaders among the Tomb Kingdoms call upon the ancient power of these items when they awaken for battle, and this power is sought after by adventurers throughout the world.

The following magic items can be used to represent some of the magical items players may come across while encountering the Tomb Kingdoms in their adventures.


#### Amulet of Nullification
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement), 5,000gp*<br>
While wearing this amulet, all magic items within 5 ft. of you are subjected to the effects of the *antimagic field* spell. This effect also applies to magic items being worn or carried by creatures within 5 ft. of you.

#### Collar of The Exalted
*Wonderous item, very rare, 6,000gp*<br>
This collar was worn by only the most worthy of leaders who gladly threw away their followers' lives to save their own.

When you take damage while wearing this collar, you can use your reaction to choose a willing creature within 10 feet to take the damage instead. The damage that the creature takes can't be negated or resisted in any way.



#### Hieratic Jar 
*Wonderous item, varies*<br>

These canopic jars were used by the liche priests of the Tomb Kingdoms to store the remains of their deceased peers, from which they could draw upon magic the dead spellcaster knew in life.

After performing a 10-minute ritual, you can store the remains of a creature within this jar. The jar can only store the remains of one creature at a time. If the creature could cast spells in life, choose one of its spells of 1st level or higher that can be cast as an action or bonus action and does not require components consumed by the spell. 

While the jar holds these remains, you can cast the chosen spell by using an action to open the lid (which can be done as part of any somatic components the spell may have.) After casting the spell, if the remains belong to a creature that was hostile to you or recognized you as an enemy in life, the creature's lingering animosity forces you to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to maintain control of its remains. On a failure, the remains are destroyed by the corrosive resentment of the former creature. 

Once a spell has been cast from the jar, it can't be used in this manner again until the next dawn.

Some rare versions of this jar can contain more potent spells and may have a higher spell saving throw DC and attack bonus. These jars also have higher saving throw DCs to contain the power of a resentful creature's remains.

#### Scroll of the Cursing Word
*Scroll, Add gp 51,200* NOTE: Even if it's consumable?<br>
As a reaction to seeing a spell being cast with a verbal component, you can draw this scroll and read its incantations in an attempt to prevent its casting. The caster must make a concentration check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fails and has no effect as the caster's mouth is filled with biting scarabs, which deal NOTE: Xd6 piercing damage per level of the spell that was being cast and prevent the caster from speaking until the start of their next turn.

#### Spell Bane Canopic Jar
*Wonderous item, varies*<br>
This canopic jar contains the remains of a high liche priest who jealously wished to stamp out all magic beyond his own.

As an action, you can open the lid of the kanopi, causing it to emit a swirling vortex that attempts to absorb any magic in the area. Every creature, object, and magical effect with 30 ft. is subjected to the effects of *dispel magic*. Spells caught in this area that are higher than 3rd level are unaffected. For every 2 effects dispelled this way, you can regain a 1st level spell slot.

Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until dawn of the following day.

Some rarer kanpoi can provide more potent effects, allowing them to dispel more powerful effects and grant their users higher-level spell slots.

##### Kanopi Levels
| Level of *Dispel Magic* Effect  | Level of Spell Slots Regained| Rarity | Cost (gp) |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:| :---------:|
|  3  | 1 | Rare | 2,600 | 
|  4  | 2 | Rare | 4,400 |
|  5  | 2 | Very Rare | 7,600 |
|  6  | 3 | Very Rare | 14,800 |
|  7  | 2 | Very Rare | 27,600 |
|  8  | 2 | Legendary | 54,400 |
|  9  | 3 | Legendary | 105,600 |


#### Staff of the Grand Hierophant

*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), NOTE: add gp cost*

This ancient staff is inscribed with the names of ancient gods, granting its wielder enhanced mastery over magical energies.

While holding the staff and casting a spell that requires concentration, you can allow a willing creature within 60 feet of you that you can see to also concentrate on that spell. The spell won't end if you lose concentration, provided the other creature maintains its concentration. However, the assisting creature will lose concentration if:

* It moves 60 or more feet away from you
* It loses line of sight with you
* You begin concentrating on a different spell


#### Vambraces of the Sun
*Wonderous item, uncommon, 1,000gp*<br>
This pair of bracers are blessed by an ancient sun god, and each is marked with a jeweled sun emblem capable of releasing a ray of blinding light. 


When you are attacked by a creature within 30 feet of you that you can see, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing bracers to shoot a flash of light at the attacker before it hits or misses. An attacker that can't be blinded is immune to this feature. Each bracer can use this ability once (allowing you two uses in total) and can't do so again until dawn of the next day.

> ***Scroll of the Cursing Word. (1/day)*** As bonus action or a reaction to the Grand Hierophant seeing a spell being cast with a verbal component, Grand Hierophant may curses each creature with in 300 feet of it for 10 minutes, Hierophant can choose to spare any creatures form the cruse, while cursed when a creature casts a spell with a verbal component, it must make a DC 20 ability check using the creatures spellcasting ability for the spell. On a success the curse ends. On a failed save, it takes 3 (1d6) slashing damage per level of the spell, if it fails by 10 or more (DC 10), spell has no effect and is wasted as it's mouth is filled with sand and dung beetles.

#### Hieratic Jar

As part of an action or bonus action being used to cast a spell of 1st level, you can open the lid of the kanopi (this can be done as part of any somatic components the spell has.) The kanopi unleashes its arcane energy and boosts the level the spell is being cast at to 2nd level. 

Once the jar is used this way, it crumbles to dust.

Some rarer jars can provide more potent effects, allowing them to boost spells to even higher levels. Any spell cast at a lower level than the jar's level is boosted to that spell level when using the jar. For example, when using a 5th level jar, any spell cast at 4th level or lower is boosted to 5th level.
