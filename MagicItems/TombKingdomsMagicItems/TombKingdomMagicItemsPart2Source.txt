## Tomb <br> Kingdom <br> Magic Items

The priests and artisans of Tomb Kingdoms <br> produced countless magical items during their <br> empire's heyday. These relics now linger in the <br> crumbling ruins dotted throughout their realm. Many <br> leaders among the Tomb Kingdoms call upon the ancient power of these items when they awaken for battle, and this power is sought after by adventurers throughout the world.

The following magic items can be used to represent some of the magical items players may come across while encountering the Tomb Kingdoms in their adventures.

#### Amulet of Nullification
*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement), 5,000gp*<br>
While wearing this amulet, all magic items within 5 ft. of you are subjected to the effects of the *antimagic field* spell. This effect also applies to magic items being worn or carried by creatures within 5 ft. of you.

#### Armor of The Ages

*Armor (Any), Very Rare, 20,000 gp*

*Its origins lost to the sands of time, predating even the first great pyramids, this ancient bronze armor has clad many warriors who fought on despite fatal wounds.*

While wearing this armor, if you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you can choose to not fall Unconscious. If you do, you do not make death saving throws at the start of your turn, but taking damage causes death saving throw failures as normal, and three failures still result in death.

#### Blessed Blade of The Sun God

*Weapon (Glaive), Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Paladin), 40,000 gp*

*Blessed by the Sun God, and wielded by the greatest pharaoh to ever live, this glaive’s edge glows with the heat of the ancient desert, delivering divine judgment to those who oppose its wielder.*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Additionally, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your paladin spells.

When you use your Divine Smite feature on a creature hit by this weapon, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to your paladin spell save DC). On a failed save, the creature is Blinded until the end of its next turn.

#### Bow of The Hawk

*Weapon (Longbow), Rare, 2,500 gp*

*Crafted for the elite archers of the Pharaoh's legions, these bows are blessed by the hawk god to bypass any obstacle, ensuring lethal precision when the marksmen strikes true.*

Attack made with this weapon ignore half and three-quarters cover. 

You also deal a extra 1d8 damage on hit if you didn't have a hostile creature within 5 feet of you when you made the attack.

#### Cloak of The Dunes

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement), 2,500 gp*

*Woven by the god of desert winds during his time in the mortal realms, this cloak is all that remains of his ascension to the divine. Those who don this mantle can transform into a gust of stinging sand, lashing at any they pass through.*

As an action, you can transform into a cloud of sand and fly up to 30 feet in a straight line. During this movement, you and any equipment you are wearing or carrying can move through spaces as narrow as 1 inch without squeezing, pass through the space of other creatures, and do not provoke opportunity attacks. You cannot be Grappled or Restrained during this movement. If you end this movement in a space too small for your normal form, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space you can occupy and take Force damage equal to twice the number of feet moved.

When you move through the space of a creature or unattended object during this movement, it takes 2d6 Slashing damage. A creature or object can take this damage only once per turn.

#### Collar of The Exalted
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare, 6,000gp*<br>
*This collar was worn by only the most worthy of leaders who gladly threw away their followers' lives to save their own.*

When you take damage while wearing this collar, you can use your reaction to choose a willing creature within 10 feet to take the damage instead. The damage that the creature takes can't be negated or resisted in any way.

#### Crook and Flail of Radiance

*Weapon (Club), Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 8,000 gp*

*These gleaming golden weapons, symbols of supreme authority in ancient dynasties, radiate an overwhelming aura of majesty that humbles all who stand before their wielder.*

You must attune to both clubs as a single item, occupying one attunement slot. While wielding these clubs, you can use your Charisma modifier instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls for melee attacks made with them.

As an action while holding both clubs, you can make one melee attack with each against a single creature. If both attacks hit, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or fall Prone and become Frightened of you until the end of your next turn or until you are Incapacitated. While Frightened in this way, the target cannot stand up.

#### Crook of Souls

*Wondrous Item (Holy Symbol), Very Rare, 12,800 gp*

*Fashioned from bronze to emulate bone, this ancient staff allows its holder to call souls from the underworld and guide them to ravage the lands of the living.*

While holding this holy symbol, you can cast *skull storm* (save DC 17). The crook cannot cast this spell again until the next dawn.

While you are within the area of a skull storm spell you cast with this crook, you take no damage from it. At the start of your turn, if you are in the spell’s area, you can change the direction it moves.

#### Crown of Kings

*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 6,000 gp*

*Passed down through the most powerful bloodline of pharaohs, this crown embodies mortal and divine <br> rulership, amplifying the wearer’s prodigious majesty.*

While wearing this crown, your Charisma <br> score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.

\columnbreak



#### Death Mask

*Wondrous Item, Rare, 3,000 gp*

*Commissioned by a tomb pharaoh who could not bear the sight of his withered form, this golden mask was fused to his face as searing gold consumed his husk, binding his soul to the expressionless visage. Those who wear it project the terror of death itself.*

Creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against being Frightened by you.

#### Destroyer of Eternities

*Weapon (Greatsword), Very Rare, 32,000 gp*

*Perhaps the deadliest weapon forged by the ancient dynasties, this greatsword was devised by a pharaoh to ensure no rival would challenge his rule. It obliterates armor, flesh, bone, and soul alike, denying its victims the golden paradise of the afterlife—a fate feared above all by the tomb pharaohs.*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it deals Force damage instead of Slashing damage.

If a creature has 25 hit points or fewer after taking damage from this weapon, or if you roll a 20 on an attack roll with it, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be destroyed. A creature destroyed this way can only be restored to life by a *true resurrection* or *wish* spell.

As an action, you can make a melee attack with this weapon against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.

#### Flail of Skulls

*Weapon (Flail), Rare (Requires Attunement), 3,000 gp*

*Hanging from the chains of this flail are gilded skulls, trophies taken from vanquished foes. When swung, the skulls gnash with golden teeth, and upon a critical strike, they shatter in an explosion of splintered bone.*

Attacks from this flail deal 1d6 Piercing damage per skull attached (to a maximum of 3d6 Piercing damage) instead of the flail’s normal damage. Additionally, the number required to score a critical hit with this weapon is reduced by 1 for each skull attached (to a minimum of 17). When you score a critical hit, one skull shatters after damage is dealt, reducing the number of skulls by one.

As an action, while attuned and holding the flail, you can attach the skull of a Small or Medium creature to the flail by spending 10 gp worth of gold to gild it. The flail can hold a maximum of three skulls at a time.

#### Gilded Dagger of The Damned

*Weapon (Dagger), Rare (Requires Attunement by a Rogue), 3,750 gp*

*Used by a ruthless prince to massacre his family in a bid for the throne, this blade still runs with the blood of its victims from that grisly night. In the hands of a skilled murderer, it exacts terrible carnage on those condemned by its wielder.*

As an action, you can place a curse on a creature you can see within 30 feet. The curse lasts until you curse another creature or until the next dawn. When you make a sneak attack against a creature cursed this way, you add 3d6 to the sneak attack damage. Once you place a curse, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.

#### Golden Ankh

*Wondrous Item (Holy Symbol), Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Cleric or Paladin), 64,000 gp*

*A symbol of eternal life among the desert peoples, this sacred golden ankh, said to be handed down by the gods themselves, infuses its bearer’s allies with divine vitality.*

While holding this holy symbol, whenever you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores hit points to a creature, that creature is Quickened* until the end of its next turn.

**New Condition Described At End of Magic Item Section*

#### Hieratic Jar 
*Wondrous Item, Varies*<br>

*These canopic jars were used by the tomb priests of the Tomb Kingdoms to store the remains of their deceased peers, from which they could draw upon magic the dead spellcaster knew in life.*

After performing a 10-minute ritual, you can store the remains of a creature within this jar. The jar can only store the remains of one creature at a time. If the creature could cast spells in life, choose one of its spells of 1st level or higher that can be cast as an action or bonus action and does not require components consumed by the spell. 

\columnbreak

<br><br>

While the jar holds these remains, you can cast the chosen spell by using an action to open the lid (which can be done as part of any somatic components the spell may have.) After casting the spell, if the remains belong to a creature that was hostile to you or recognized you as an enemy in life, the creature's lingering animosity forces you to make a DC 13 Charisma saving throw to maintain control of its remains. On a failure, the remains are destroyed by the corrosive resentment of the former creature. 

Once a spell has been cast from the jar, it can't be used in this manner again until the next dawn.

Some rare versions of this jar can contain more potent spells and may have a higher spell saving throw DC and attack bonus. These jars also have higher saving throw DCs to contain the power of a resentful creature's remains.

##### Hieratic Jar Levels
|Max Spell Level  | Save DC for Spells and the Jar| Spell Attack Bonus | Rarity | Cost (gp) |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:| :---------:|  :---------:|

#### Plaque of Incantations

*Wondrous Item, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard of 3rd level or higher), 8,000 gp*

*Inscribed by a high priestess of a mighty mortuary cult, this ancient stone tablet bears incantations to empower the armies of the tomb pharaohs.*

While holding this plaque, you always have the following spells prepared: *cursed blades*, *guiding wind*, *incantation of protection*, and *incantation of zeal*. When you expend a spell slot to cast one of these spells, the spell’s effective level is increased by 1. 

*Descriptions for these spells found at end of document*

#### Sapphire Beetle

*Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement), 50,000 gp*

*This ornate brooch comes alive at its wearer’s command, flying on jeweled wings. Its presence dampens magical incantations, guarding those under its protection from harm.*

As a bonus action, you can command this sapphire beetle to fly in circles around a target creature (including yourself) you can see within 60 feet. It follows the target until you use a bonus action to recall it or direct it to another target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from you or uses an object interation to swat it away, the beetle attempts to return to you and circle you. If it cannot return, it becomes inert.

A creature with the beetle circling it has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. Additionally, if it succeeds on a saving throw against a spell or magical effect that allows a save for half damage, it takes no damage instead.


#### Scarab Brooch

*Wondrous Item, Rare, 8,000 gp*

*Fashioned by tomb priests to protect royal families, this beetle-shaped talisman is imbued with the power of the underworld gods to shield its wearer from harm.*

If an attack hits you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker to reroll the attack roll with disadvantage. If you fail a saving throw, you can use your reaction to reroll it with advantage. You must use the new roll.

#### Scimitar of The Scorpion

*Weapon (Scimitar), Rare (Requires Attunement by a Rogue of 5th level or higher), 1,000 gp*

*Anointed with the venom of three different necroscorpions, this toxic blade has been used by assassins of the tomb priest cult to end those who turned from the faith.*

When you make a sneak attack with this scimitar, you can choose to remove three sneak attack dice before rolling damage to force the target to make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus. On a failed save, the target suffers one of the following effects of your choice, applied immediately after the attack’s damage is dealt:

**Radiant Venom.** The target takes 2d6 Radiant damage and glows until the end of your next turn, shedding dim light in a 10-foot radius. Attack rolls against it have advantage if the attacker can see it, and it cannot benefit from being Invisible.

**Mystifying Venom.** The target takes 2d6 Psychic damage. At the start of its next turn, it moves in a random direction (determined by rolling a d8) until it exhausts its movement, takes damage, or encounters an object or creature, then continues its turn as normal.

**Leaching Venom.** The target takes 3d6 Necrotic damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt, lasting for 1 minute.

\columnbreak

#### Scorpion Armor

*Armor (Half Plate), Rare (Requires Attunement), 5,500 gp*

*This black armor, engraved with intricate designs honoring the scorpion god, is not forged of metal but chitin. Its wearer moves through the dunes with predatory silence and agility.*

You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with Medium Armor, and it has no Strength requirement. Additionally, you do not have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks while wearing it. You also gain a Burrowing speed of 15 feet.

#### Scroll of The Cursing Word
*Scroll, Very Rare, 640 gp* <br>
As a reaction to seeing a spell being cast with a verbal component, you can draw this scroll and read its incantations in an attempt to prevent its casting. The caster must make a Concentration saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the spell's level. On a failure, the spell fails and has no effect as the caster's mouth is filled with biting scarabs, which deal 1d8 piercing damage per level of the spell that was being cast and prevent the caster from speaking until the start of their next turn.

#### Shield of The Sun

*Armor (Shield), Uncommon, 2,000 gp*

*This golden shield traps the rays of the desert sun within its surface, releasing them in a brilliant flash at a word.*

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an attack roll while you are wielding this shield, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before the attacker. A creature immune to the Blinded condition is unaffected.

#### Spear of Siphoning

*Weapon (Spear), Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 32,000 gp*

*Crafted by a tomb noble desperate to extend his life, this spear feasts on the life force of those it wounds, transferring their vitality to its wielder in a rush of vigor.*

Once per turn, when you hit a creature that is not an Undead or Construct with this spear, you can force it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of Fatigue*, and are you Quickened* until the end of your next turn.

**New Condition Described At End of Magic Item Section*


#### Spell Bane Canopic Jar
*Wondrous Item, Varies*<br>
*This canopic jar contains the remains of a high tomb priest who jealously wished to stamp out all magic beyond his own.*

As an action, you can open the lid of the kanopi, causing it to emit a swirling vortex that attempts to absorb any magic in the area. Every creature, object, and magical effect with 30 ft. is subjected to the effects of *dispel magic*. Spells caught in this area that are higher than 3rd level are unaffected. For every 2 effects dispelled this way, you can regain a 1st level spell slot.

Once you use this ability, you can't do so again until dawn of the following day.

Some rarer kanpoi can provide more potent effects, allowing them to dispel more powerful effects and grant their users higher-level spell slots.

##### Spell Bane Canopic Jar Levels
| Level of *Dispel Magic* Effect  | Level of Spell Slots Regained| Rarity | Cost (gp) |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:| :---------:|
|  3  | 1 | Rare | 2,600 |

|  7  | 3 | Very Rare | 27,600 |
|  8  | 4 | Legendary | 54,400 |
|  9  | 4 | Legendary | 105,600 |

#### Staff of Death

*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster), 26,000 gp*

*Once carried by a necromancer so dreadful that his name is forbidden, this staff channels ebon winds of magic to unleash ghastly destruction.*

The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you have resistance to Necrotic damage.

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *spirit leech* (1 charge), *aspect of dread* (2 charges), *crippling pain* (3 charges), *impending doom* (4 charges), or *wind of death* (5 charges).

#### Staff of The Grand Hierophant

*Staff, Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 2,000gp*

*This ancient staff is inscribed with the names of ancient gods, granting its wielder enhanced mastery over magical energies.*

While holding the staff and casting a spell that requires concentration, you can allow a willing creature within 60 feet of you that you can see to also concentrate on that spell. The spell won't end if you lose concentration, provided the other creature maintains its concentration. However, the assisting creature will lose concentration if:

* It moves 60 or more feet away from you
* It loses line of sight with you
* You begin concentrating on a different spell

#### Staff of Venom

*Weapon (Quarterstaff), Rare, 8,375 gp*

*Fashioned in the shape of an asp for the great queen of serpents, this jade staff writhes with a life of its own, striking with venomous stone teeth or spitting bolts of poison. Its hatred for the vampires that destroyed its creator’s kingdom allows its wielder to deliver venomous death to such unholy creatures.*

This Quarterstaff deals an extra 2d6 Poison damage on a hit (or 2d8 Poison damage if wielded with two hands). While holding it with both hands, you can make a ranged spell attack using your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus, with a range of 150 feet, ignoring half and three-quarters cover. On a hit, the attack deals 2d6 + your Dexterity modifier Poison damage.

While holding the staff, any Poison damage you deal ignores resistance and immunity to Poison damage from Undead, and your spells and abilities ignore any immunity to the Poisoned condition of Undead.

#### Tomb Blade

*Weapon (Longsword), Very Rare, 4,200 gp*

*Imbued with potent necromancy, this blade calls to the souls of its victims, abducting and binding them within its bronze forever.*

The blade has 5 charges and regains 1d4 + 1 charges daily at dawn. You gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls made with this weapon, and a creature hit by it takes an extra 1d8 Necrotic damage.

You can expend 1 charge when you hit a creature to force it to make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the target’s soul is extracted and trapped in the blade, leaving its body unconscious in a state of suspended animation for 1 minute, after which the body dies. The effect ends early if you die, become Incapacitated, take 30 or more damage in a single turn, or extract another soul into the blade. A *dispel evil and good* spell cast on the target returns its soul to its body. At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.

> ##### New Condition: Fatigue
> The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> 
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> 
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
>
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.
> 
> **Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.
> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue. 
>


> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A Quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the Quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the Quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

#### Vambraces of The Sun
*Wondrous Item, Uncommon, 1,000gp*<br>
*This pair of bracers are blessed by an ancient sun god, and each is marked with a jeweled sun emblem capable of releasing a ray of blinding light.*

You may cast *Warding Light.* Each bracer can be use to cast this spell once (allowing you two uses in total) and can't do so again until dawn of the next day.
