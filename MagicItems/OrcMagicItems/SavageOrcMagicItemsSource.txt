## Savage Orc Magic Items
If orcish craftsmanship is considered crude by the standards of other races, the savage orcs' crafting abilities are simply barbaric. Their items are carved from wood and bone or ripped straight from the natural world. However, they carry a primal power the civilized races could never hope to harness. Through shamanistic rituals and raw belief in their power, the orcs are able to infuse these crude items with savage power beyond the comprehension of a logical mind.

All of the magic weapons listed here have the "chopper" trait, which is described on the last page of the document.

#### Baleful Mask
*Wondrous item, very rare, (requires attunement by a druid, bard, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard), 16,000gp*

*This rough wooden visage, saturated with ancient power, once belonged to an orc prophet whose deeds have been lost to time. Those who don this mask become infused with psionic energy, their eyes glowing green through its rough-hewn sockets. With a mere glance, the wearer can unleash bolts of disintegrating magic or crush the minds of their foes.*

This mask has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

While wearing it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it without any Verbal components, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: *brain burster* (1 charge), *brutal glare* (2 charges) or *psychic headbutt* (4 charges).

When you cast a spell with the mask, you can spend 1 additional charge to change the casting time to a Bonus Action for this casting.

#### Bonewood Staff
*Staff (arcane or druidic focus), very rare <br> (requires attunement by a spellcaster),  6,000 gp*

*Etched with a myriad of Orcish glyphs of war, this staff not only shields its wielder but also enables them to unleash devastating magic while delivering bone-crushing blows with its hefty form*

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +1 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.

In addition, whenever you cast a first or higher-level spell while wielding this staff, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.

#### Frost Basher
*Weapon (greatclub chopper), uncommon (requires attunement), 1,000 gp*

*This translucent club of rough-hewn ice was chiseled from a massive glacier by the savage orcish tribe that dwells in its shadow. Those struck by this weapon feel their blood begin to freeze within their veins.*

The weapon deals cold damage instead of bludgeoning damage. When you make your first attack with this weapon on your turn and hit a creature, it has disadvantage on the next weapon attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn. A creature immune to cold damage can't gain disadvantage this way.

#### Orcish War Paint
*Wondrous item (tattoo), rare (requires attunement)  2,000 gp*

*Inks are crafted by the most devoted orcish shamans, who believe that colors hold innate power and can enhance an orc when applied to the body. So certain are these mystics of this truth that the tattoos they etch manifest real power.*

**Tattoo Attunement.** To attune to this item, you hold the needle to your skin where you want the tattoo to appear, pressing the needle there throughout the attunement process. When the attunement is complete, the needle turns into the ink that becomes the tattoo, which appears on the skin.

If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the tattoo vanishes, and the needle reappears in your space.

##### Black War Paint

*Symbol of resilience (orcs believe wearing black makes you harder to kill).*

Your Constitution score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Constitution is already 19 or higher. Additionally, whenever you regain hit points, treat any rolled dice as having rolled their maximum value.

##### Blue War Paint

*Symbol of cunning and luck (orcs believe blue is the color of protection).*

Your Intelligence score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher. Additionally, you gain a +1 bonus to ability checks, saving throws, and AC.

##### Purple War Paint

*Symbol of stealth and invisibility (orcs claim that no one has ever seen a purple orc).*

Your Dexterity score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Dexterity is already 19 or higher. Additionally, as an action, you can turn invisible until the end of your next turn or until you attack, deal damage, or force a creature to make a saving throw.

> ##### New Condition: Quickened
> A quickened creature gains an additional action on each of its turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack or unarmed strike only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. The *haste* spell applies the quickened condition among its other effects, and a creature cannot benefit from the quickened condition from multiple sources at once.

<br>

##### Red War Paint

*Symbol of speed and brutality (orcs believe that anything red moves faster).*

Your Strength score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Strength is already 19 or higher. Additionally, you have advantage on initiative rolls, and when you roll initiative, you are quickened (condition described at end of document) until the end of your next turn.

##### White War Paint

*Symbol of death and fearlessness (orcs associate white with the intent to kill).*

Your Wisdom score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Wisdom is already 19 or higher. Additionally, your weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 18-20. If you score a critical hit on a creature that has 30 hit points or fewer after taking the damage, it drops to 0 hit points.

##### Yellow War Paint

*Symbol of wealth and power (orcs also believe yellow things make better explosions).*

Your Charisma score becomes 19 while you wear this tattoo. It has no effect if your Charisma is already 19 or higher. Additionally, when you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that can be upcast to deal additional damage dice (such as *fireball* or *inflict wounds*), you can increase the spell’s effective level by 1.

#### Pike of the Beast
*Weapon (pike chopper), very rare (requires attunement), 3,000 gp*

*This pike has been wielded in countless great hunts throughout the ages, felling myriad deadly beasts. Its staff is adorned with numerous trophies—teeth, claws, and hides—claimed from each conquest. The shaft constantly shifts with primitive pictographs, revealing crude depictions of these battles. Those who grasp this weapon become suffused with the spiritual might of the fallen creatures.*

At dawn each day, roll on the Beast Spirit table. The weapon gains the corresponding effect until the next dawn.

##### Beast Spirit
| d6  | Spirit |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | ***Boar.*** When you hit a creature with your first weapon attack on your turn using this weapon, the target is knocked prone if it is Large or smaller. |
|  2  | ***Triceratops.*** When you hit a creature with your first weapon attack on your turn, the target becomes disrupted until the end of your next turn. While disrupted, it can't gain the benefits of the Disengage or Dodge action, and if it is within 10 feet of you, it has disadvantage on all attack rolls. |
|  3  | ***Rhino.*** When you hit a creature with your first melee weapon attack on your turn using this weapon, the target is impaled. An impaled target is grappled (escape DC 15). While impaling a creature, the weapon can't be used to attack other targets. If you release the weapon, the grapple ends.|
|  4  | ***Mammoth.*** When you make your first weapon attack on your turn using this weapon, hit or miss, the target and each creature of your choice within 5 feet of it takes 5 thunder damage.
|  6  | ***Tyrannosaurus.*** When you hit a creature with your first weapon attack on your turn using this weapon, you inflict two wounds on the creature. |
|  2  | ***Wolf.*** When you hit a creature with your first weapon attack on your turn, the target becomes exposed until the end of your next turn. While exposed, your allies have advantage on attack rolls against it if you are within 10 feet of you.

#### Spike Spitter
*Weapon (longbow chopper), very rare (requires attunement), 2,000 gp*

*This heavy bow, fashioned from the horn of a titanic rhino, channels the beast's raw power. If the wielder fires an arrow while running, it will strike with the force of a charging behemoth.*

When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, if you moved at least 20 feet straight toward the target immediately before making the attack, the attack deals an extra 2d8 damage on a hit.

#### Zapper Wand
*Wand,  very rare (requires attunement by a Spellcaster),  1000 gp*

*This clunky, battered flint spike has been passed down for generations from one savage shaman to the next. Those who wield this weathered wand find that their incantations gain a powerful kickback.*

When you make a spell attack for the first time each turn while holding this wand, you gain a -1 bonus on the attack roll, and it deals an extra 2d4 damage on a hit of the damage type dealt by the spell (if there are multiple damage types, you choose which).

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
> 
>  * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
>  * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
>  * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.

## Choppers

Choppers are crude and hefty weapons favored by many orcish clans. An orc's strength allows them to wield these weapons with brutal efficiency, whereas many other species would struggle to even lift them. Although they can deliver devastating blows, their bulky nature makes them cumbersome to wield. Orcs refer to any weapon with these traits as a chopper, whether a massive war maul or a mighty longbow requiring tremendous strength to draw.

### Chopper Weapon Trait
Any weapon can have the Chopper trait added to it, which grants it the following features:

* If it has the Finesse or Thrown properties, it loses them.

* When a creature makes an attack for the first time on its turn with a Chopper weapon, it gets a -1 penalty on that attack roll and deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

* The weapon gains the Heavy trait, if it doesn't already have it and, the weapon's weight is doubled.

* Attacks made with the weapon suffer disadvantage due to its hefty nature unless the creature wielding it has a Strength score of 13 or higher.

### New Feat: Chopper Master
*Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher*<br>
You've mastered the savage art of wielding choppers and their weight now helps rather than hinders you. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you make an attack for the first time on your turn with a Chopper weapon, you get a +1 bonus to the attack instead of a -1 penalty.
