## Orcish Magic Items
While orcs aren't known for their master craftsmanship, they still find a way of getting their hands on magic items that reflect their brutal nature. These are generally items blessed by their most powerful shamans, cobbled together from the artifacts of other races, or simply infused with psychic emanations of their aggression. 

All of the magic weapons listed here have the "chopper" trait, which is described on the last page of the document.

#### Axe of the Last War
*Weapon (greataxe chopper), rare (requires attunement), 6,000gp*

*A sacred object to orcs and a subject of prophecy. Any who bring this axe into battle will find that the weapon becomes more difficult to control as the conflict rages on. It is said that one day, the mightiest orc warrior to have ever lived will take up the weapon and begin a rampage that will cascade into a war that ends the world.*

Instead of dealing an extra 1d4 damage on a hit when you make your first attack each turn, this chopper deals an extra 1d8 damage.

When you roll initiative, you can choose to have the weapon gain a level of power whenever you take the attack action on your turn until combat ends. The weapon can gain a maximum of 3 levels of power. For each level of power, the weapon has, it gains a -1 penalty to attack rolls and deals an additional 1d8 damage on hit.

While the weapon has any levels of power, you cannot be disarmed of the weapon or drop it.

#### Big Kicking Boots
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement), 1,000gp*

*These boots once belonged to a ferocious orc warlord known for knocking down any foe that crossed his path. He eventually met his match when he attempted to kick an ancient dragon that blocked his way. After a blast of fire, only his boots were left when the smoke cleared. It is said that his might and stench still cling to them to this day.*

When you make an attack for the first time on your turn, if it is an unarmed strike, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll, and it deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit. If the attack is a shove, you gain a +1 bonus to your Strength (Athletics) check, and if you win, you can push the creature back 5 feet and knock it prone.

#### The Big Smasher
*Weapon (maul chopper), rare (requires attunement), 4,000 gp*

*Originally stolen from a dwarven stronghold by orc marauders, this weapon has since been modified by its new owners. The weapon is now spoken of with disdain and fear among dwarven kind, and many orc warriors wielding this weapon have broken through entire regiments of dwarf soldiers.*

While wielding this weapon, you can use your action to make a melee attack against each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you, with a separate attack roll for each target. Each attack made this way suffers the chopper’s -1 penalty to attack rolls and deals an additional 1d4 damage on a hit.

#### Gut Slasher
*Weapon (greataxe chopper), very rare (requires attunement), 16,000 gp*

*This black metal axe is dotted with permanent splatters of crimson and crude orcish talismans chained and bolted to its haft. All of these have been acquired over a long, violent existence. One who bears this weapon is filled with an urge for violence that propels them into battle faster than most opponents can mount a proper defense.*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Additionally, during the first round of combat, you can choose to take your turn on initiative count 22 instead of your normal initiative (losing ties). If you do, you can only use your action to take the Attack action, making attacks with this weapon on that turn, and you can't cast spells during that turn.

#### Iron Gnashers
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement), 1,000gp*

*Whenever this large metal jaw plate is donned, the wearer is overcome with excessive bloodlust.*

While wearing this jaw plate, you can use a bonus action to make a melee weapon attack with it. It counts as a simple melee weapon with the chopper rule for you, and you add your Strength modifier to the attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. It deals 1d8 piercing damage on a hit, and the attack scores a critical hit on a roll of 18-20.

#### Seeking Chopper
*Weapon (greataxe chopper), rare (requires attunement), 4,000gp*

*This crudely made axe seems to bear its own murderous cunning, able to nudge itself just enough to turn what would be a failed strike into a bloody success.*

When you make the first attack on your turn, if you miss and the attack was made with this weapon, you can reroll it. You must use this new roll and you may only make attacks with this weapon for the rest of the turn.

#### Spiteful Shield
*Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement), 1,000gp*

*This round shield has a sharp snaggletooth mouth stretched across it in an unpleasant frown; any foes that fumble their attacks too close will regret their misstep*

While you wield this shield, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you rolls a 1 on an attack roll, you can have the shield deal 4d8 piercing damage to that creature.


#### Staff of Wild Weirding 
*Staff, very rare (requires attunement by a sorcerer), 2,400 gp*

*Created by an unorthodox and ambitious orc shaman obsessed with channeling destructive levels of primal magic through himself, this battered, misshapen staff was his final exploit. Those who use the staff to tap into the raw winds of magic can only hope to be more fortunate than its creator.*

While attuned to this staff, you can channel its power to gather the winds of magic.  This can be done as a bonus action or whenever you roll for initiative.  When you do so, the staff gains 1d6 charges, which last for 1 minute or until you expend them.  

\columnbreak

If you roll a 1, you gain no charges and must roll on the Miscast Table below to determine what kind of magical backlash you suffer. 

You can't roll for charges again until you spend a 10-minute ritual with the staff, which you can do during a short or long rest.

While the staff has charges, you can expend charges as though they were sorcery points, except they can't be converted into spell slots.


 ##### Miscast Table
| 1d6 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  | Miscast Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  1  |   You surge with unstable power that can't be contained. You and each creature in a 15-foot-wide, 120-foot-long line originating from you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 6d6 force damage and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. You have disadvantage on the saving throw.|
|  2  | Sudden pulses of energy cause you to move spastically and expel fountains of raw destruction. For the next minute, you are incapacitated, and on each of your turns, you use your movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8. After moving, you spew energy in a 30-foot cone in a direction of your choice. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 3d12 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.|
|  3  |   	Your consciousness seeks to anchor itself to another. You and another willing creature you can see within 60 feet are under the effects of the *warding bond* spell for the next hour. While under this effect, you can speak telepathically to each other. If the effect ends early or there are no willing creatures within range, you take 6d8 psychic damage.|
|  4  |  Your mind begins to split, unleashing agonizing thoughts that tear apart all they touch. At the start of each of your turns, you and another creature of your choice that you are aware of within 30 feet of you must make DC 15 Intelligence saving throws, taking 3d6 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At the end of each of your turns, roll a d6; on a 1 or 2, the effect ends.|
|  5  |    	Your mind is ravaged by chaotic magic, leading you into a frenzied rampage. For the next 10 minutes, you are berserk (condition described on the next page). Your Strength score becomes 20, and your staff deals an extra 3d6 force damage to any target you hit with it.|
| 6   | The staff becomes overloaded, and you gain 7 charges. The staff can't regain charges until the next dawn.|

#### Sword of Screaming Insults
*Weapon (greatsword chopper), rare (requires attunement), 4,000 gp*

*The sword bears a peculiar enchantment that causes the user's voice to become as sharp as the blade, able to cut down foes just as well.*

While wielding this sword, you can use an action to cast the *vicious mockery* spell with it. The spell save DC is equal to 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Charisma modifier.

Moreover, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn, you can cast a cantrip in place of one of your attacks made with this weapon.

#### Orc-Blessed Armour
*Armor (plate), rare, 4,000 gp*

*This plate armor was made from sheets of metal hacked off from various suits of enchanted armor that were taken from a myriad of slain foes and welded together by orcish magic. As burdensome as the armor is, it grants the wear the aggression and tenacity of the mightiest orc.*

While wearing this armor, you can use your bonus action to gain 5 temporary hit points, and you may move up to your speed toward an enemy of your choice that you can see or hear. You must end this movement closer to the enemy than when you started.



#### Warclan's Horn 
*Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement), 4,000gp*

*Many orc bosses of the past owe their decisive victories not to their cunning strategy or leadership but to a well-timed blow of this horn that can rally even the most wary allies and unsettle even the most emboldened foes.*

You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and blow the horn, which emits a sound audible up to 600 feet away. When you do so, you can designate any number of creatures within 100 feet of you. Each chosen creature can end any conditions that are frightening them. Each other creature within 100 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for the next minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
The horn can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

## Choppers

Choppers are crude and hefty weapons favored by many orcish clans. An orc's strength allows them to wield these weapons with brutal efficiency, whereas many other species would struggle to even lift them. Although they can deliver devastating blows, their bulky nature makes them cumbersome to wield. Orcs refer to any weapon with these traits as a chopper, whether a massive war maul or a mighty longbow requiring tremendous strength to draw. 


### Chopper Weapon Trait
Any weapon can have the Chopper trait added to it, which grants it the following features:

* If it has the Finesse or Thrown properties, it loses them.

* When a creature makes an attack for the first time on its turn with a Chopper weapon, it gets a -1 penalty on that attack roll and deals an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.

* The weapon gains the Heavy trait, if it doesn't already have it and, the weapon's weight is doubled.

* Attacks made with the weapon suffer disadvantage due to its hefty nature unless the creature wielding it has a Strength score of 13 or higher.

### New Feat: Chopper Master
*Prerequisite: Strength 13 or higher*<br>
You've mastered the savage art of wielding choppers and their weight now helps rather than hinders you. You gain the following benefits:

* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.

* When you make an attack for the first time on your turn with a Chopper weapon, you get a +1 bonus to the attack instead of a -1 penalty.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Berserk
> Berserk creatures gain the following effects unless an ability states otherwise:
> * The creature can only use its movement to move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can only use its action, bonus action, and reaction to make melee attacks or move closer to an enemy it can see or hear.
> * The creature can't maintain concentration on spells or other effects.
> * The creature can't be frightened or charmed.
