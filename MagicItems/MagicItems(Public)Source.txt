# New Magic Items



#### Crystal Slippers
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This footwear is made from an enchanted crystalline material with a glassy finish.  When you take the disengage action while wearing both slippers, you may also dash as a bonus action.

You can retain your attunement to the slippers even if you lose one, but both slippers are required for the initial attunement. 

A creature holding the lost slipper knows your location as if they cast the *locate creature* spell on you.






















#### Lucky Charm
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small charm can be attached to any piece of jewelry or clothing.  While wearing it, whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may roll an additional d20.  You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.  You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

If multiple creatures use a lucky charm or luck point granted by the Lucky feat on the same roll, they cancel out, resulting in no additional dice.

Once you use this feature, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn, and a creature that has used a lucky charm can't use another until it takes a long rest.


#### Magic Hand Guards (+1/+2/+3)
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare(+3)*
These items are worn around one's hands and can take the form of straps of cloth or leather, boxing gloves, or even brass knuckles.  While wearing them, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes.  The bonus is determined by the item's rarity.




#### Mox
*Wonderous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This gem contains power associated with a specific school of magic and can empower spells from that school.  When you cast a spell from the school of magic associated with the gem, you may use the gem to empower the spell, causing it to be cast at one level higher.  The gem can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The mox's material determines what school of magic it is associated with.

**Amber** - Conjuration

**Jet** - Necromancy

**Ruby** - Evocation

**Pearl** - Abjuration 

**Chrome** - Transmutation

**Opal** - Divination

**Emerald** - Enchantment

**Sapphire** - Illusion

#### Rod of Magic Detection
*Rod, uncommon, 100g*

While holding this rod, you may use an action to touch a creature or object with it.  If the target bears any magic, the rod will glow with a color that varies depending on the school of magic it detects from the target.
