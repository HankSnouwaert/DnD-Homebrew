## Beastman Magic Items
Most beastmen don't take part in crafting anything beyond the crudest weaponry as they are more inclined towards destruction than creation. However, they often acquire powerful magical items by twisting the creations of others or finding dark sources of power in the wild that can be formed into imposing weapons. The following magic items reflect some of the creations that can be found in their possession.


### Axe of Man-Slaying 
*Weapon (Greataxe), Uncommon (Requires Attunement), 1,000 gp*  

*The Axe of Man-Slaying earned its name for its ability to cleave even the largest warrior in twain as easily as a hot knife cuts through butter. This fearsome weapon slices with terrifying ease, its effortless carving through the strongest foes a stupefying—and horrifying—sight that emboldens allies while breaking enemies.*

When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 20 slashing damage. If a creature has 20 Hit Points or fewer after taking this damage, it is cut in half and dies. If a creature dies this way, each enemy in a 60-foot emanation from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of you for the next minute. A frightened creature takes the Dash action and moves away from you by the safest route on each of its turns unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a space where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, it makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the effect ends on that creature. Additionally, each ally in the emanation may end any frightened condition affecting them.


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


### The Black Star

*Weapon (Morningstar), Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 16,000 gp*

*The cudgel was forged from the remnants of a meteorite that crashed down from the heavens, unleashing a wave of madness upon impact. Those who take up this hulking weapon find its spirit granting them visions of mayhem and slaughter—causing the wielder’s mind to drown in insanity.*

When you roll Initiative while holding this weapon, you can choose to have the weapon gain up to three charges until the end of combat. The weapon gets +1 to attack rolls and deals an additional 1d8 dice of damage for each charge it has. Additionally, at the start of each of your turns, even if you are not holding the weapon, you roll a number of d6s on the Madness Effects Table (found at the end of the document) equal to the number of charges on the weapon to determine your actions during the turn.


### Horn of the First Beast

*Wonderous Item (Instrument), Rare (Requires Attunement), 12,800 gp*

*This fossilized horn belonged to the first beast birthed from the twisting power of Chaos, when its corruption first took hold in the mortal realm. When blown, it releases an ancient roar that fills those who hear it with primeval fury.*

As an action, you can blow this horn, causing each ally within 60 feet to become Emboldened*. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until the next dawn. When the horn is sounded, it can be heard clearly up to a mile away.

**New condition described at the end of the document*

### Horn of the Great Hunt

*Wonderous Item (Instrument), Very Rare <Br> (Requires Attunement), 60,000 gp*

*Said to have been fashioned from the tusk of a dead boar god, this horn has been used by beastmen for generations in their foul conquests. When sounded, the entire warband surges forward with predatory fervor.*

When you roll Initiative and are not incapacitated or surprised while holding the horn, you may blow it. If you do, any number of allies within 120 feet of you that can hear the horn, and are not surprised or incapacitated, also roll Initiative and gain a +5 bonus to their roll. Their speed then increases by 20 feet for their first turn in combat. When the horn is sounded, it can be heard clearly up to a mile away.


### Hunting Spear

*Weapon (Spear), Rare (Requires Attunement), 4,800 gp*

*This thick-shafted hunting spear was crafted to fell the mighty beasts of the frozen wastes. The enchantments infused within it surge with power when the weapon is hurled, increasing its velocity and impact force.*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, attacking at long range with this weapon doesn’t impose disadvantage on the attack rolls, and the weapon deals an extra 2d6 piercing damage on hit if the attack was made at long range.


### Mind Mangler

*Weapon (Scimitar), Rare (Requires Attunement), 4,000 gp*

*Said to have once been a sentient weapon, its mind was shattered when its master attempted to use it to slay the hideous jabbersnarl brood mother of the ancient wood. The broken remnants of the blade’s consciousness—and twisted reflections of the revolting abomination—are still woven into its metal. Any struck by it have their minds assaulted by demented thoughts and maddening visions.*

At the end of your turn, you may choose one creature you hit with this weapon on this turn and force it to make a DC 15 *Intelligence Saving Throw*. <Br> *Failure:* The creature can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn and rolls a number of d4s on the Madness Effects Table below equal to the number of times it was hit with the weapon this turn.

### Primeval Club

*Weapon (Club), Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 18,000 gp*

*This simple branch, wrapped in crude skins, is said to be a weapon fashioned in the distant past by the first tribes of humans who inhabited the deepest woods—long before villages and cities dotted the landscape. Those of truly feral nature are able to wield this club, delivering savage blows with primal force.*

While you aren’t wearing heavy armor or wielding a shield, you gain a +3 bonus to attack rolls made with this magic weapon, and when you hit with an attack using this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d4 bludgeoning damage. In addition, you can use your Wisdom instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using this weapon.

### Ram Horn Helm
*Wonderous Item, Rare (requires attunement), 4,000 gp*

*The helm was fashioned from a pair of thick, coiling horns taken from a particularly dreadful beastlord, slain by a rival who wished to add the impressive horns to his own regalia. The wearer of this mantle is able to charge into enemy lines with bone-cracking force.*

While wearing this helm, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Additionally, once per turn, if you move 20+ feet straight toward a target before hitting it with a melee weapon attack, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Rod of the Chattering Skull

*Rod, Uncommon (Requires Attunement),  1,000 gp*

*Once, a mighty bray-speaker tenaciously sought to master the dark arts to a degree no other disciple of Chaos ever had. So merciless was his pursuit of this twisted desire that he spiraled into lunacy. Ultimately, the shaman became so unhinged that his own tribe was forced to decapitate him. Now, the bray-speaker’s bleached skull is fastened to a crude rod, its jaws chattering as it imparts the maddening knowledge it gathered in life.*

The rod has 6 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 of its expended charges daily at dawn.

When you or a willing creature you can see within 60 feet of you that can see and hear you fails a saving throw while you're holding the rod, you can use your reaction to expend a charge to roll up to 3d6 and add the number rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success. On the creature's next turn, the creature performs the action on the Madness Effects Table (found at the end of the document) equal to the number added to the saving throw.

### Sacrificial Dagger

*Weapon (Dagger, Holy Symbol, Arcane Focus, Druidic Focus), Rare (requires attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 10,000 gp*

*A rough-hewn blade, stained with the blood of thousands of sacrifices. Any who add to the countless lives it has claimed will be greatly rewarded.*

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Additionally, when you deal damage to a creature with a CR or class level of 1 or higher with this weapon, if it has 15 Hit Points or fewer after taking the damage, it dies and the blade gains a charge. The dagger can hold up to 5 charges.

While holding the dagger, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *aspect of dread* (2 charges), *crippling pain* (4 charges), *wind of death* (5 charges).

**Spell descriptions found at the end of the document*

### Shredder Claws

*Weapon (Sickle), Rare (Requires Attunement), 5,000 gp*

*Many elegant elven swords were shattered to create this set of vicious claws, each blade pilfered from the mangled corpse of a mighty elven warrior and transmuted into one of the wicked fingers of this deadly apparatus. The claws can tear through anything they are set against, limited only by the fury of their wielder.*

The weapon comes in a pair, which the creature must have both of to attune to and counts as one attunement.

When you roll the weapon’s damage dice for an attack you make with either weapon, for each 4 you roll, the weapons deal an additional 1d8 damage on any further attacks you make this turn with either one. Additionally, when you score a critical hit with either weapon, instead of rolling all of your damage dice twice and adding them together, you treat the d4 roll as a 4.

### Staff of Swarming Insects (Revised)

*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 16,000 gp*

*The staff teems with all manner of invertebrates that endlessly scuttle up and down its surface, waiting to be unleashed at the command of its bearer.*

This staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn.

**Spells.** While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *fog cloud* (1 charge, the cloud appears as a swarm of insects), *vile tide** (2 charges), *giant insect* (4 charges), or *insect plague* (5 charges).

- **Classes:**  Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard 
___

You envelop a creature you can see within range in a terrifying aura. Every other creature within 10 feet of the target must make a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the target for the duration.
A creature frightened in this way can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the radius of the aura increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 2nd.

#### Crippling Pain

- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (A broken bone)
- **Duration:**  1 round
- **Classes:**  Cleric Warlock, Wizard

You afflict a creature within range with an agonizing curse, causing its body to wither as it's wracked with necrotic energy. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it takes 6d6 necrotic damage and is wracked with pain until the end of your next turn.

On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage and is not affected by the pain.

While wracked with pain, every time the creature takes a move, an action, a bonus action, or a reaction, it takes an additional 3d6 necrotic damage.

***At Higher Levels.***   When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the initial damage is increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 3rd.

\columnbreak

#### Vile Tide

- **Duration:**   Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Classes:**  Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer
___

You cause a swarm of insects to erupt from the ground within a 10-foot square area at a point you choose within range. Each creature standing in this area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d4 piercing damage, and insects burrow into the creature, remaining there for the spell's duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half the initial damage, and the insects do not burrow into it. 

While the insects are burrowed in a creature, the creature has disadvantage on checks, cannot regain hit points, and takes 2d4 piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. 

Any creature within reach can use an action to perform a Wisdom (Medicine) check against your spell save DC to try to remove the insects from a creature. This check must be done using a weapon or object that deals fire, piercing, or slashing damage, and it causes 1d4 damage of its damage type to the target. On a successful check, all the insects are destroyed, and the spell ends for that creature. The creature making the check can choose to gain advantage by more aggressively trying to remove the insects, but if it does, the target takes 3d4 damage instead. 

Alternatively, a creature can expend a use of a Healer's Kit or use the *lesser restoration* spell to purge the insects without needing to make a check.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 2d4 for each slot level above 2nd.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, either the cold or the necrotic damage (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.
