# Treasure Trove: Magic Items (2021-2022)

## Item Notes
### Magic Nets
Unless stated otherwise, a net loses its magical properties once a creature it has entangled is freed from it.

#### Anti-Magic Net
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), legendary (DC 19)*

A creature hit by this net must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on any ongoing spells and be unable to cast spells until the start of its next turn. At the start of each turn that it is restrained by the net, the creature must succeed on the same saving throw or be subjected to the effects again until the start of its next turn. The DC of this Concentration save is determined by the rarity of the net.


#### Armour of Wrath
*Armor (heavy), very rare, 6,000gp*<br>

Forged in demonic flames and cooled in the blood of slain warriors, this crimson armor poses little hindrance to those whose hearts burn with rage.

You gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. 

Additionally, if you have at least three levels in the barbarian class, you are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with heavy armor, and you retain the full benefits of your Rage and Fast Movement barbarian class features while wearing this armor.

#### Battle Anchor 
*Harpoon spear, rare*

Only the mightiest of nautical warriors can wield this massive anchor. This weapon has the heavy and two handed properties, its attacks deal 2d6 piercing damage, and creatures wielding it must have a Strength of 14 or higher to make attacks with it without disadvantage. 

When you strike a creature with the anchor, you can choose not to tether it and instead deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing. If a creature dealt bludgeoning damage this way is Huge or smaller, it is knocked back 10 feet. 

Additionally, a Huge or smaller creature tethered by the anchor moves at half its speed. 

#### Beguiling Gem
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This entrancing gemstone can be incorporated into any piece of jewelry and glows with a pinkish hue that beguiles anyone who comes near it. While you are wearing this gem, any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you. While charmed this way, it is incapacitated. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if you are not within 5 feet of the creature at the end of any turn, if it takes any damage, or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor. Once the creature breaks free of the charm, it is immune to this item's effects for 1 hour.

#### Blade of Fate
*Weapon (any sword), rare, 2,000gp*<br>

Visions of future victories dance across this blade's reflective surface.  None know if it predicts fate or twists it.

At dawn each day, roll two d20s.  If you roll a 20 on either die, reroll it until you roll a different number.  Record the final results of each die.

When you make an attack roll with this weapon and roll one of the numbers you noted, you may treat the roll as if it were a 20.  You can only use each of the noted numbers once this way.  At dawn each day, you lose the numbers from the previous day.


#### Blood Blade
*Weapon(greatsword), rare, 1,500gp*<br>

This massive sword was forged with bloodthirsty instincts.  If a strike from this blade lands correctly, it will drink deep of its victim's life force.  

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.   

Additionally, when you roll the damage dice for an attack you make with the weapon, if at least two of the damage dice roll the same result, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage.  If both of these damage dice roll the same result, repeat this process until both dice don't roll the same result.



#### Carnage Axe
*Weapon (any axe), very rare, 9,000gp*<br>
This unholy axe has been forged from bloodsoaked brass fused with demonic souls.  Ever eager for combat, the souls are roused when they sense multiple enemies nearby.

You have advantage on attack rolls made with this weapon as long as there are two or more hostile creatures within 5 feet of you that aren't incapacitated.


#### Collar of Scorn
*Wondrous item, legendary, 50,000gp*<br>
This brass collar is inscribed with powerful runes that ward off all magic that would target the wearer, as well as any magic the wearer would attempt to utilize.

While wearing this collar, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, spell attacks have disadvantage against you, and you have resistance to damage from spells.

***Curse.*** Once you don this collar, you can't doff it unless it is targeted by the *remove curse* spell or similar magic. While wearing the collar, you can't cast or concentrate on spells. You are also not affected by spells unless they would damage you, force you to make a saving throw, reduce your movement speed, or inflict other negative effects.

\pagebreakNum

#### Chromatic Tome
*Wonderous item, very rare, 12,000gp (requires attunement)*

This tome serves as a prison for a sorcerous demon and offers great power to those willing to assume terrible risks.

While attuned to this book, you can read from its pages to gather the winds of magic.  This can be done as a bonus action or whenever you roll for initiative.  When you do so, the book gains 2d6 charges which last for 1 minute or until you expend them.  If you roll a 2, you gain no charges and must roll on the Miscast Table below to determine what kind of magical backlash you suffer. 

You can't roll for charges again until you spend 10 minutes studying its pages, which can do during a short or long rest.

While the book has charges, you can expend 3 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17,  attack bonus of +9), using it as your spellcasting focus: *chromatic orb* (3 charges), *scorching ray* (4 charges), *shatter* (4 charges), *lightning bolt* (6 charges) *hunger of hadar* (6 charges), *wall of fire* (7 charges).


 ##### Miscast Table
| 2d6 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  | Miscast Effect  |
|:---:|:---------:|
|  2  |    Fiendish limbs tear through reality and pull you into a demonic realm of torment.  Your body is destroyed, and your soul and physical belongings are transported to a layer of the Abyss in possession of a demon lord of the DM's choosing.  |
|  3-4  |  You violently discharge arcane energy, dealing 10d6 force damage to you and each creature within 15 feet of you.|
|  5-6  |   The treacherous demon trapped within the book gives its aid elsewhere.  For the next minute, a creature of the DM's choosing within 100 feet of you gains the ability to cast spells as though it were holding the tome with 12 charges available.|
|  7  |  You take 4d6 necrotic damage and can't cast spells until the start of your next turn.|
|  8-9 |    A massive vortex drains all the magic in the area.  You take 8d6 force damage, and all spells with 100 feet of you are dispelled as though targeted by *dispel magic* cast at 9th level.|
|  10-11  | Your mind is ravaged by demons, causing you to be under the effects of the *feeblemind* spell for the next 10 minutes.|
| 12  | The book becomes overloaded,  gaining 12 charges.  Until it loses these charges, spell attack rolls made as part of casting spells from the book are made with advantage, and all creatures have disadvantage on the next saving throw they make against a spell cast from the book.  The book can't regain charges for the next 1d4 days.|

#### Combat Angler's Fishing Rod
*Harpoon spear, rare*

This weapon takes the form of an enchanted fishing pole. As an action, you can add rope to the pole, which then automatically creates a fishing hook at the end.

This weapon functions like a normal harpoon spear with the following exceptions:

* Ranged attacks made with this weapon are made by throwing the fishing hook out at targets rather than throwing the weapon itself, though it can still only tether one target at a time and can't be used to make attacks while it is tethering a target.
* The distances for ranged attacks made with this weapon increase to 60/200. 
* Melee attacks made with this weapon deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing and cannot tether targets.  
* Whenever a creature you can see makes a bite attack, you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it with this weapon. If this attack hits, the creature has disadvantage on the bite attack. You cannot make this attack if you already have a creature tethered with the pole.

#### Crystal Slippers
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This footwear is made from an enchanted crystalline material with a glassy finish.  When you take the disengage action while wearing both slippers, you may also dash as a bonus action.

You can retain your attunement to the slippers even if you lose one, but both slippers are required for the initial attunement. 

A creature holding the lost slipper knows your location as if they cast the *locate creature* spell on you.

#### Electro-Harpoon
*Harpoon spear, very rare (requires attunement)*

This harpoon contains a magical apparatus capable of electrifying it and its tether. As an action, you can electrify the tether between yourself and a harpooned target. Each creature directly between you and the harpoon must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity save or take 4d6 lightning damage. The harpooned target automatically fails this save.

#### Electro-Net
*Net, common (1d6), uncommon (3d6), rare(5d6), very rare(8d6), legendary (12d6)*

Creatures restrained by this net take lighting damage at the start of each of their turns and can't take reactions. The amount of lighting damage they take is determined by the rarity of the net.



\pagebreakNum

#### Enrapturing Instrument
*Wonderous item, very rare*<br>
This enchanted item can take the form of any instrument but always requires two hands to use.  You can use an action to play it, and when you do so, every creature within 300 ft. of you that can hear its song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the song ends.  You can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to continue playing and can stop at any time.  The song also ends if you are incapacitated.

#### Fetid Shroud 
*Wondrous item, very rare, 6,000gp (requires attunement)* <br>

The shroud feels and smells as though it's been soaked in a fever sweat. The air around it is thick and chokes any who linger too close.

While wearing this shroud, any creature which starts its turn within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the effects of this shroud for 1 hour.

#### Flail of Pestilence
*Weapon (flail), very rare, 24,000gp (requires attunement)*

Said to be crafted from the growths and encrusted puss spewed out by a demon of decay, this flail inflicts those it strikes with demonic rot. 

Once during your turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you may force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, the creature takes an additional 3d8 necrotic damage.  After failing three of these saving throws within one minute, it is afflicted with one of the diseases described by the *contagion* spell (your choice) for one minute.



#### Flesh Peeling Bell
*Wondrous item, very rare, 26,000gp (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

The cursed ringing of this bell accelerates decay, allowing necrotic magic to inflict wounds that quickly rot away their victim. It can be held in one hand and used as a spell casting focus.

Once per turn, while you are holding the bell, when you hit a creature with a spell attack that deals necrotic damage, or a creature fails its saving throw against a spell you cast that deals necrotic damage, you can inflict it with a wound. At the start of each of the wounded creature's turns, it takes 1d4 necrotic damage for each time you've wounded it, and it can then make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, ending the effect of all such wounds on itself on a success. 

Alternatively, the wounded creature, or a creature within 5 feet of it, can use an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, ending the effect of all such wounds on it on a success.

#### Ghost Net
*Net, rare*

This net can restrain incorporeal creatures normally immune to the restrained condition. Creatures restrained by the net cannot planeshift to the Ethereal Plane.

\pagebreakNum

#### Goose Ribbon
*Wonderous item, uncommon*

This enchanted ribbon is a popular gift among the fey.  While wearing it, you are transformed into a **mischievous goose** as though under the effects of a *polymorph* spell.  You can use the ribbon to remain transformed this way for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter sessions, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration.

#### Helm of the Blighter
*Wondrous item, very rare, 7,000gp (requires attunement by a druid)*

This foul helm was crafted from decaying animal bones held together by blighted moss.  While wearing this helm, any beast that a druid shapeshifts into becomes a rotting mockery of its natural form.

If you transform using your Wild Shape feature while wearing this helm, you may choose to take necrotic damage equal to 5 x the CR of the creature you are transforming into.  This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way, and your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken.  If this reduction reduces your hit point maximum to 0 or less, you die.  This reduction lasts until you finish a long rest. 

If you choose to take this damage while transforming using Wild Shape, your animal form has the following alterations:

* Your creature type changes to undead.
* You are immune to necrotic and poison damage and the poisoned condition.
* Whenever you deal damage with an attack in this form, you can change the damage type to necrotic or poison.
* Your form's hit points are increased by the amount equal to the necrotic damage you took from the helm when you transformed.

#### Instrument of Maddening Inspiration
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*<br>
This item can take the form of any instrument but always requires two hands to use.  You can use your action to play it and draw mad inspiration from the demonic realms of chaos.  When you do so, you must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw.  You get +2 to the result for each form of long-term madness you are suffering from.  On a success, you regain one use of your Bardic Inspiration feature.  On a failure, you gain one random form of long-term madness, which lasts for the next hour.  Each time you regain a use of Bardic Inspiration using this item, the save DC of subsequent uses increases by 2.  The save DC resets to 10 at the next dawn.

#### Lash of Despair
*Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunment)*<br>
This wicked whip unleashes waves of soul-rending torment with each crack.  Once per turn, when you hit a creature with this whip, you can choose to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage to it and all creatures within 5 feet of it.

\columnbreak

#### Lucky Charm
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small charm can be attached to any piece of jewelry or clothing.  While wearing it, whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may roll an additional d20.  You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.  You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

If multiple creatures use a lucky charm or luck point granted by the Lucky feat on the same roll, they cancel out, resulting in no additional dice.

Once you use this feature, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn, and a creature that has used a lucky charm can't use another until it takes a long rest.


#### Magic Hand Guards (+1/+2/+3)
*Wondrous Item, uncommon (+1), rare (+2), very rare(+3)*
These items are worn around one's hands and can take the form of straps of cloth or leather, boxing gloves, or even brass knuckles.  While wearing them, you gain a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with unarmed strikes.  The bonus is determined by the item's rarity.


#### Mask of the Destroyer
*Wondrous item, very rare, 9,000gp*<br>

This fearsome mask of brass aids its wearer in bloody murder, but those who fail to appease its bloodlust are punished harshly.

When you take the attack action, you may choose to activate the mask's powers.  If you do, until the end of your turn, when you make a melee weapon attack and miss, you can reroll the attack.  You must use the new result. 

At the end of a turn in which you activated the mask, if you have not killed or reduced a creature to 0 hit points this turn with a weapon attack, you take 6d6 necrotic damage. This damage can't be reduced or prevented in any way.


#### Masque of Subversion
*Wonderous item, legendary (requires attunement)*<br>
This hauntingly beautiful mask beguiles and bewitches those who would cause its wearer harm.  While wearing this mask, if a creature you can see within 120 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the attacker must target another creature within range of the attack other than you.  

If multiple creatures are within range, the attacker chooses which one to target.  If no other creatures are within range of the attack, the attack is wasted.

\pagebreakNum

#### Mega Net 
*Net, rare*

When you throw this net, you target a point within its range. As it lands, the net magically expands either 5 or 10 feet (your choice) outwards in all directions from that point. Make an attack roll with the net against each creature completely within that area. On a hit, that creature is restrained by the net. 

Huge creatures can be restrained by the net, but Gargantuan creatures are immune.

If one of the creatures restrained by the net is moved, all other creatures in the net are moved with it. However, no effect can move a creature within the net unless it can move all the creatures in the net.

Each creature must cut or break its way free of the net individually. The net doesn't lose its magical properties until each creature it has restrained is freed from it.


#### Mox
*Wonderous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This gem contains power associated with a specific school of magic and can empower spells from that school.  When you cast a spell from the school of magic associated with the gem, you may use the gem to empower the spell, causing it to be cast at one level higher.  The gem can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The mox's material determines what school of magic it is associated with.

**Amber** - Conjuration

**Jet** - Necromancy

**Ruby** - Evocation

**Pearl** - Abjuration 

**Chrome** - Transmutation

**Opal** - Divination

**Emerald** - Enchantment

**Sapphire** - Illusion


#### Paradoxical Armor
*Armor (any), very rare, 20,000gp*<br>

This armor flickers in and out of existence, appearing solid at one moment and incorporeal at the next.  Attackers have an almost equal chance of hitting the armor's wearer no matter their positioning or tactics.

While wearing this armor, no attack roll can gain advantage or disadvantage against you.


#### Rapier of Ecstatic Conquest
*Weapon (rapier), rare*<br> 
This thin, elegant blade is engraved with thousands of whispering, red-lipped mouths, and it can bestow crippling bliss with the slightest scratch.  Attacks with this rapier score a critical hit on an attack roll of 19 or 20.  Additionally, creatures struck by a critical hit from this weapon suffer the effects of the *slow* spell until the end of their next turn.

#### Rod of Magic Detection
*Rod, uncommon, 100g*

While holding this rod, you may use an action to touch a creature or object with it.  If the target bears any magic, the rod will glow with a color that varies depending on the school of magic it detects from the target.

\columnbreak

#### Rot Blade
*Weapon (any sword or axe), uncommon, 1,000gp (requires attunement)*<br>
This rusty blade is encrusted with the entrails of plague victims, and those it cuts are quickly infected with lethal diseases.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, you can force it to make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw.  On a failed save, it is infected with the blade's disease.  At the start of each of the infected creature's turns, it takes 1d6 necrotic damage and then makes a DC 14 Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success.  Once a creature becomes infected by the blade, it can't be infected again for the next 24 hours.



#### Self-Reeling Harpoon Gun
*Harpoon gun, uncommon (+1, +2, or +3 Str Mod), rare (+4 Str Mod), or very rare (+5 Str Mod)*

The harpoon gun contains a magical pully system that reels in tethered targets at the wielder's command. When you make an opposed Strength check against a creature tethered with this weapon to pull it or avoid being pulled by it, you can apply the weapon's modifier rather than your Strength modifier to the check. The value of the weapon's modifier depends on its rarity.

#### Shadow Net
*Net, rare*

Creatures restrained by this net are blinded unless they have the ability to see through magical darkness as cloying shadows cover their eyes.

#### Shield of Growths
*Armor (shield), rare, 3,000gp*

The rusted frame of this shield is reinforced with living blubber and grime, which feeds off the open wounds of its wielder.

While holding this shield, whenever you take damage from an attack, the shield grants an additional +1 bonus to AC until the start of your next turn.  It can increase its AC up to 4 times this way within a turn.

\pagebreakNum

#### Staff of Change
*Staff, very rare, 15,000gp (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*<br>

This staff infuses spells with the raw powers of chaos, inflicting random mutations on its victims.

While holding this staff, the save DC of all your spells increases by +1.

Additionally, when one or more creatures fail a saving throw against a spell you cast of 3rd level or higher while wielding this staff, you can choose one of those creatures and cause it to suffer a random mutation determined by the Mutation Table below.  At the end of each of the target's turns, it makes a Charisma saving throw against the spell's save DC, ending all mutations affecting it on a success.  A creature can't suffer from two instances of the same mutation at once.

##### Mutation Table
| d6  | Mutation | Creature Effect |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  |  Wild Spasms | The target can't take reactions, and on each of its turns it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.
|  2  | Degeneration  | The target's form becomes unstable.  The first time it takes damage each turn, it takes an extra 1d10 force damage.|
|  3  | Twisted Arms |  The target can no longer wield weapons or cast spells with somatic components.|
|  4  | Inverted Eyes | The target is blinded and has blindsight with a radius of 5 feet.|
|  5  | Gelatinous Legs | The target falls prone as its legs can no longer support its weight.   At the start of each of its turns, its legs give out again, causing it to fall prone again.|
|  6  | Regeneration | The target regains 10 hit points at the start of its turn.  The target only dies if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate any hit points.|



#### Staff of Decay
*Staff, very rare, 26,000gp (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*<br>
This blighted staff was carved from the rotting wood of a dying treant and holds power over the processes of death and decay.

You have resistance to necrotic damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *inflict wounds* (1 charge), *stream of corruption* (2 charges), *blight* (4 charges), or *circle of death* (6 charges).

The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff melts into brackish water and is destroyed.

### New Spell

#### Stream of Corruption
*2nd-level evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot cone) or 100 feet
- **Components:** S, M (a vial of meltwater)
- **Duration:**   Instantaneous
- **Classes:**  Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard
___

Bile spews forth from you in a 30-foot cone.  Each creature in that area must make a Constitution saving throw.  A creature takes 3d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

When you cast this spell, you may instead choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and force it to make a Constitution saving throw.  On failed save, it takes 3d8 necrotic damage, and you may cause the cone of bile described above to spew forth from the creature in the direction you choose.  On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and does not spew bile.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, increase the necrotic damage dealt to targeted creatures and creatures in the area of the cone of bile by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.



#### Threading Needle
*Harpoon spear, rare*

This giant magical sewing needle is said to have been crafted by eccentric fey lords. When you tether a creature with this weapon, the needle pierces through the target, and if you have a free hand, you may have it automatically fly back to that hand while keeping the target tethered with magical thread. 

Maintaining the tether still occupies one of your hands. However, you can tether additional creatures with this needle, and each tether made with the needle can be maintained with the same hand. The needle deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage per creature it is tethering. 

Each tethered creature must still stay within 60 feet of you to maintain the tether. If a tethered creature succeeds on a check to pull you by the tether, rather than pull you or snap the tether, it magically moves through the thread and frees itself. 

If the tether is cut, each tethered creature is freed. You may use an action to reapply a rope to the needle, which turns the rope into more magical thread.


#### Toxic Net
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), or legendary (DC 19)*

These nets are woven with vines that release poisonous aerosols when destroyed. If the net is snapped or destroyed with slashing damage, each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Consitution saving throw, with the DC determined by the net's rarity. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. 

A creature poisoned this way can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

The net doesn't lose its magical properties until it is destroyed this way.

\pagebreakNum

#### Underworld Skewers
*Harpoon spear, rare (requires attunement)*

These ghastly harpoons are said to be forged in the underworld and made for hunting wayward spirits. The harpoons come in a set of 10 that are all bound to a quiver. To attune to them, you must be in possession of the quiver, and while attuned, you can use an action to cause all the harpoons to reappear in their quiver.

These harpoons can tether incorporeal creatures normally immune to the grappled condition, and the tethers attached to these harpoons take on a ghostly quality and cannot be cut, though they can still be snapped through Strength checks. 

While one or more of these harpoons are impaled in any creatures within 60 feet of you, you may use an action to call all the harpoons back, causing them to rip themselves free and deal their weapon damage to the creatures they were impaling before flying back to their quiver. The harpoons phase through all obstacles to reach their quiver.



#### Unfathomable Tome
*Wonderous item, very rare, 8,000gp (requires attunement by a wizard)*

This demonic text offers wizards a seemingly endless amount of arcane knowledge, though plumbing its depths risks one's sanity.

This book can be used as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells, and while you are carrying it, you can speak and write in Abyssal.  The book functions as a spellbook for you, and the gold and time you must spend to copy spells into it is halved.  Spells from this book cannot be copied into other spellbooks.

Additionally, you may spend an hour studying the book to uncover its secrets.  When you do so, name three different spells from the wizard spell list that are all the same spell level.  These must be spells you have previously seen cast or read in texts such as spellbooks or spell scrolls.  Label these spells 1 through 3.  Roll a d4 and add the spell whose number matches the result to your spellbook.  On a roll of 4, you must make a Wisdom saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the chosen spells.  On a failure, you gain a random long-term madness effect for the number of days equal to the level of the chosen spells.  The book can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

When this book becomes unattuned to a creature, all the spells it contains are lost.



####  Wand of Whimsy
*Wand, very rare, 24,000gp (requires attunement by a spellcaster)* <br> 

This wand was carved from demonic bones and is capable of reducing its victims into writhing beasts of chaotic flesh.

While holding this wand, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls.

When you attack a small or larger creature with a spell attack and roll a 20 on the attack roll while holding this wand, that target must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw.  On a failure, the creature dies and its body turns into a **blue horror of change** under your control.  An additional **blue horror of change** is created for each size category above medium the creature was.  

Any **blue horror of change** and any **brimstone horrors of change** they spawn share your initiative count.   They take their turns immediately after yours in any order, and they obey your verbal commands (no action required by you).  If you don't issue any commands, the horrors spend their turns pursuing and attacking the nearest non-demons to the best of their abilities.  Any horrors made this way melt into goo after 1 minute.  

A creature killed this way can only be revived by a *true resurrection* or *wish* spell.

#### Warp Stone Token
*Wonderous item, rare, 200g*

While in possession of one or more warp stone tokens, you can use an action to eat any number of tokens to regain one expended spell slot of your choice. If the expended slot level is higher than the number of tokens eaten, the new slot level is equal to the number of tokens eaten. You must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking an amount of necrotic damage based on the number of tokens eaten on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This damage and hit point maximum reduction can't be reduced or prevented in any way except by succeeding on the saving throw, and it lasts until you finish a long rest.

The amount of necrotic damage taken and DC of the saving throw depend on the number of tokens eaten, as shown in the Warp Stone Token Table below.

##### Warp Stone Token Table 
| Number of Tokens  | Save DC |  Damage  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  | 13 | 2d6|
|  2  | 14 | 4d6|
|  3  | 16 | 6d6|
|  4  | 17 | 7d6|
|  5  | 19 | 9d6|
|  6  | 22 | 12d6|
|  7  | 23 | 13d6|
|  8  | 24 | 14d6|
|  9  | 27 | 17d6|




#### Wit Stealer Sword
*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This sword slashes through mind and body.  Its attacks deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage.  At the end of each of your turns, all creatures who have been struck at least twice by this sword since the start of your turn must make DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of the *confusion* spell until the end of their next turn.  A creature that has suffered this effect from the sword is immune to it for the next hour.
