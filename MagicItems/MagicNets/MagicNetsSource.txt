## Magic Nets

#### Anti-Magic Net
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), legendary (DC 19)*

A creature hit by this net must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on any ongoing spells and be unable to cast spells until the start of its next turn. At the start of each turn that it is restrained by the net, the creature must succeed on the same saving throw or be subjected to the effects again until the start of its next turn. The DC of this Concentration save is determined by the rarity of the net.


#### Electro-Net
*Net, common (1d6), uncommon (3d6), rare(5d6), very rare(8d6), legendary (12d6)*

Creatures restrained by this net take lighting damage at the start of each of their turns and can't take reactions. The amount of lighting damage they take is determined by the rarity of the net.

#### Ghost Net
*Net, rare*

This net can restrain incorporeal creatures normally immune to the restrained condition. Creatures restrained by the net cannot planeshift to the Ethereal Plane.

#### Shadow Net
*Net, rare*

Creatures restrained by this net are enveloped in darkness, causing them to be blinded as well as restrained.

#### Toxic Net
*Net, common, uncommon, rare, very rare, or legendary*

These nets are woven with vines that release poisonous aerosols when destroyed. If the net is snapped or destroyed with slashing damage, each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Consitution saving throw, with the DC determined by the net's rarity. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. 

A creature poisoned this way can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

#### Mega Net
*Net, rare*

This net can restrain Huge creatures. When you throw this net, it magically extends itself outwards, and you can make an attack roll with it against each creature in a 10-foot area within range. Each creature you hit is restrained by the net, and if one of those creatures is moved, all other netted creatures are moved with it.
