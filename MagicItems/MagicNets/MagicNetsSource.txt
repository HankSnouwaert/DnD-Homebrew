## Magic Nets
Unless stated otherwise, a net loses its magical properties once a creature it has entangled is freed from it.

#### Anti-Magic Net
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), legendary (DC 19)*

A creature hit by this net must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on any ongoing spells and be unable to cast spells until the start of its next turn. At the start of each turn that it is restrained by the net, the creature must succeed on the same saving throw or be subjected to the effects again until the start of its next turn. The DC of this Concentration save is determined by the rarity of the net.


#### Electro-Net
*Net, common (1d6), uncommon (3d6), rare(5d6), very rare(8d6), legendary (12d6)*

Creatures restrained by this net take lighting damage at the start of each of their turns and can't take reactions. The amount of lighting damage they take is determined by the rarity of the net.

#### Ghost Net
*Net, rare*

This net can restrain incorporeal creatures normally immune to the restrained condition. Creatures restrained by the net cannot planeshift to the Ethereal Plane or benefit from invisibility. 

#### Shadow Net
*Net, rare*

Creatures restrained by this net are blinded unless they have the ability to see through magical darkness as cloying shadows cover their eyes.

#### Toxic Net
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), or legendary (DC 19)*

These nets are woven with vines that release poisonous aerosols when destroyed. If the net is snapped or destroyed with slashing damage, each creature within 5 feet of it must make a Consitution saving throw, with the DC determined by the net's rarity. On a failure, the creature is poisoned for 1 minute. 

A creature poisoned this way can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

The net doesn't lose its magical properties until it is destroyed this way.

#### Mega Net
*Net, rare*

When you throw this net, you target a point within its range. As it lands, the net magically expands either 5 or 10 feet (your choice) outwards in all directions from that point. Make an attack roll with the net against each creature completely within that area. On a hit, that creature is restrained by the net. 

Huge creatures can be restrained by the net, but Gargantuan creatures are immune.

If one of the creatures restrained by the net is moved, all other creatures in the net are moved with it. However, no effect can move a creature within the net unless it can move all the creatures in the net.

Each creature must cut or break its way free of the net individually. The net doesn't lose its magical properties until each creature it has restrained is freed from it.
