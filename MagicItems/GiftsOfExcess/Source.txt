## Gifts of Excess
Powerful demons or cults of excess and decadence will sometimes craft magical items which channel their perverse powers.  They may wield these items themselves or gift them to worthy followers.  The following magic items can be used to represent these gifts of excess in your campaign.

#### Beguiling Gem
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This entrancing gemstone can be incorporated into any piece of jewelry and glows with a pinkish hue that beguiles anyone who comes near it. While you are wearing this gem, any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or become Obsessed* with you until the start of its next turn. If the creature succeeds, it is immune to this item's effects for 1 hour.

**New condition described at end of document*

#### Enrapturing Instrument
*Wonderous item, very rare*<br>
This enchanted item can take the form of any instrument but always requires two hands to use.  You can use an action to play it, and when you do so, every creature within 300 ft. of you that can hear its song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be Charmed by you until the song ends.

You can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to continue playing and can stop at any time.  The song also ends if you are Incapacitated.

Creatures Charmed by you this way are Incapacitated.  If a Charmed creature is more than 5 ft. away from you, it must move on its turn toward you by the most direct route available.  The creature doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into dangerous terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than you, it can repeat the saving throw.  The creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.  If a creaure's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the effects of this instrument's song for 24 hours.

#### Instrument of Maddening Inspiration 
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*<br>
This item can take the form of any instrument but always requires two hands to use. You can use your action to play it and draw mad inspiration from the demonic realms of chaos. 

When you do so, you must make a *Charisma Saving Throw:* DC 10. 

*Success:* you regain one use of your Bardic Inspiration feature. 

*Failure:* You gain one random Madness of Excess from the table below. If you roll a madness that you already have, reroll until you gain a new one. The madness lasts until you finish a long rest.

Each time you regain a use of Bardic Inspiration using this item, the save DC of subsequent uses increases by 2. The save DC resets to 10 at the next dawn.  

If you have every madness effect from the Madness of Excess Effects table, you can't use this item until at least one of them has cleared.

##### Madness of Excess Effects
| 1d6  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------|
| 1  | **Avarice.** You cannot willingly let go of any objects. If an item is taken from you, you take 1 Psychic damage. |
| 2  | **Carnality.** You are Charmed by all other creatures. If any creature harms you, you are no longer Charmed by that creature.  |
| 3  | **Gluttony.** You must eat a day’s worth of rations every 3 hours or suffer one level of exhaustion. |
| 4  | **Indolence.** You require 3 hours for a short rest and 24 hours for a long rest. |
| 5  | **Paramountcy.** You have disadvantage on all Wisdom ability checks. |
| 6  | **Vainglory.** Whenever you roll a natural 20 on a d20 test, treat it as if you rolled a 1. |

#### Lash of Despair
*Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunment)*<br>
This wicked whip unleashes waves of soul-rending torment with each crack.  Once per turn, when you hit a creature with this whip, you can choose to deal an additional 2d6 Psychic damage to it and all creatures within 5 feet of it.

#### Masque of Subversion
*Wonderous item, legendary (requires attunement)*<br>
This hauntingly beautiful mask beguiles and bewitches those who would cause its wearer harm.  While wearing this mask, if a creature you can see within 120 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the attacker must target another creature within range of the attack other than you.  

If multiple creatures are within range, the attacker chooses which one to target.  If no other creatures are within range of the attack, the attack is wasted.

#### Rapier of Ecstatic Conquest
*Weapon (rapier), rare*<br> 
This thin, elegant blade is engraved with thousands of whispering, red-lipped mouths, and it can bestow crippling bliss with the slightest scratch.  Attacks with this rapier score a critical hit on an attack roll of 19 or 20.  Additionally, creatures struck by a critical hit from this weapon are Drowsy* until the end of your next turn.

#### Wit Stealer Sword
*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This blade inflames the minds of creatures gripped by emotion, leaving them dazed and overwhelmed by chaotic thoughts. 

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, and attacks made with it deal an additional 1d6 Psychic damage. If you hit a creature with this weapon that is Charmed, Drowsy*, Frightened, or Obsessed*, it is Dazed* until the end of its next turn.

### Gifts of Excess: New Conditions

#### Dazed 
A Dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

#### Drowsy 
This condition brings a creature to the brink of falling asleep. Creatures immune to effects that would put them to sleep are immune to this condition. While a creature is drowsy, it is under the following effects:<br>
* It moves at half speed.<br>
* It has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and Dexterity saves.<br>
*  It can't concentrate. <br>
* Attacks against it have advantage. <br>
* The only spells it can cast are cantrips. <br>

\columnbreak

<br><br>

#### Obsessed 
The creature becomes fixated on a creature or object, which becomes a source of its obsession. Being Obsessed has the following effects on a creature:
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't target any creature or object with an attack, spell, or ability except for a source of its obsession.
* While the creature can see a source of its obsession, it can't cast spells or use abilities that target an area (such as the *fireball* spell) unless a source of its obsession is in that area. 
*  The creature can't willingly move away from a source of its obsession.
