# Gifts of Excess
Powerful demons or cults of excess and decadence will sometimes craft magical items which channel their perverse powers.  They may wield these items themselves or gift them to worthy followers.  The following magic items can be used to represent these gifts of excess in your campaign.

#### Beguiling Gem 
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This entrancing gemstone can be incorporated into any piece of jewelry and glows with a pinkish hue that beguiles anyone who comes near it. While you are wearing this gem, any non-demon creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of you must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you. While charmed this way, it is incapacitated. The creature may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. The effect also ends if you are not within 5 feet of the creature at the end of any turn, if it takes any damage, or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor. Once the creature breaks free of the charm, it is immune to this item's effects for 1 hour.

#### Enrapturing Instrument
*Wonderous item, very rare*<br>
This enchanted item can take the form of any instrument but always requires two hands to use.  You can use an action to play it, and when you do so, every creature within 300 ft. of you that can hear its song must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the song ends.  You can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to continue playing and can stop at any time.  The song also ends if you are incapacitated.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Creatures charmed by you this way are incapacitated.  If a charmed creature is more than 5 ft. away from you, it must move on its turn toward you by the most direct route available.  The creature doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into dangerous terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than you, it can repeat the saving throw.  The creature can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.  If a creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to the effects of this instrument's song for 24 hours.

#### Instrument of Maddening Inspiration 
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement by a bard)*<br>
This item can take the form of any instrument but always requires two hands to use.  You can use your action to play it and draw mad inspiration from the demonic realms of chaos.  When you do so, you must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw.  You get +2 to the result for each form of long-term madness you are suffering from.  On a success, you regain one use of your Bardic Inspiration feature.  On a failure, you gain one random form of long-term madness, which lasts for the next hour.  Each time you regain a use of Bardic Inspiration using this item, the save DC of subsequent uses increases by 2.  The save DC resets to 10 at the next dawn.

#### Lash of Despair
*Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunment)*<br>
This wicked whip unleashes waves of soul-rending torment with each crack.  Once per turn, when you hit a creature with this whip, you can choose to deal an additional 2d6 psychic damage to it and all creatures within 5 feet of it.

#### Masque of Subversion
*Wonderous item, legendary (requires attunement)*<br>
This hauntingly beautiful mask beguiles and bewitches those who would cause its wearer harm.  While wearing this mask, if a creature you can see within 120 feet of you makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to force the attacker must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw.  On a failed save, the attacker must target another creature within range of the attack other than you.  

If multiple creatures are within range, the attacker chooses which one to target.  If no other creatures are within range of the attack, the attack is wasted.

#### Rapier of Ecstatic Conquest
*Weapon (rapier), rare*<br> 
This thin, elegant blade is engraved with thousands of whispering, red-lipped mouths, and it can bestow crippling bliss with the slightest scratch.  Attacks with this rapier score a critical hit on an attack roll of 19 or 20.  Additionally, creatures struck by a critical hit from this weapon suffer the effects of the *slow* spell until the end of their next turn.

#### Wit Stealer Sword
*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)*<br>
This sword slashes through mind and body.  Its attacks deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage.  At the end of each of your turns, all creatures who have been struck at least twice by this sword since the start of your turn must make DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer the effects of the *confusion* spell until the end of their next turn.  A creature that has suffered this effect from the sword is immune to it for the next hour.
