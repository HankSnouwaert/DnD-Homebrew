## Ninja-Themed Magic Items


#### Armor of Trepidation
*Armor (light, medium, and heavy), rare* (2,500gp)<br>
This armor holds the natural trepidation of the ratfolk that forged it.

You have a +3 bonus to AC while wearing this armor and are frightened. While wearing this armor and frightened, you may willingly move closer to the source of your fear as well.

#### Cloak of Shadows
*Wonderous item, very rare* (20,000gp)<br>
This cloak was woven from the hair of murder victims and spider silk and allows its wearer to become undetectable in darkness.

While in darkness while wearing this cloak, you are invisible to any creature that relies on darkvision to see you in that darkness, are hidden from divination magic, and can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.

#### Tenebrous Pedant 
*Wonderous item, rare (requires attunement)* (2,000gp)<br>
This pendant was crafted from the skull of a ratfolk shadow master and emits dark, smokey incense that can be used to cloak its wearer in inky darkness. 

The pendant has 10 charges. While wearing it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word and expend 1 or more of its charges. When you do so, shadows begin pouring out from it for a number of minutes equal to the charges you expended or until you use another bonus action to command it to stop. While the shadows are pouring out, dim light within 10 feet of you turns into darkness, and bright light in the same area is turned into dim light. 

\columnbreak

If an area being dimed by the pendant overlaps with an area being illuminated by a spell of 1st level or higher, the pendent shuts off early.

The pendant regains 1d6 + 4 expended charges daily at dusk.

#### Triad Stars
*Weapon (throwing star), rare (requires attunement)* (1,500gp)<br>
These three magical throwing stars were carved from the bones of a master assassin. You must possess all three to attune to them. While attuned to them, you can use an action to cause all three to teleport into your hand. 

Each star has a +1 to attack and damage rolls it deals an extra 1d4 poison damage to any target it hits. When you strike a target with a star, it takes an additional 2d4 poison damage if it has been hit by one of the other stars within the last minute. If it has been hit by both of the stars within the last minute, it instead takes 3d4 additional poison damage.

#### Weeping Blade 
*Weapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)* (6,000gp)<br>

This blade constantly drips with a black acid that can eat through armor.

Once per turn, when you hit a creature with this weapon, you can choose to deal an additional 2d6 acid damage and cover it in acid. The creature remains covered in acid until it or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off. At the end of a creature’s turn, if it is covered in acid this way, it takes 2d6 acid damage, and any armor it is wearing takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 is destroyed.

### New Weapon: Throwing Star
These small, sharpened metal stars can be thrown or used as a stabbing weapon to deal small amounts of damage and potentially deliver poisoned attacks.  Their small size and unassuming nature make them ideal concealed weapons.


#### Throwing Star
*ranged weapon (simple)*
___
- **Damage:** 1
- **Damage Type:** Piercing
- **Properties:** Finesse, light, thrown(20/60), special
- **Cost:** 5 sp
- **Weight:** 1/10 lb
___

***Throwing Star.*** You can use two-weapon fighting to make off-hand attacks with throwing stars as though they are melee weapons, and you can use throwing stars to make melee weapon attacks as though they are light melee weapons. However, you still have disadvantage on these attack rolls if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and isn't incapacitated. 



### New Feat: Throwing Star Master
You mastered the art of using the normally unassuming throwing star to disrupt your foes and set up brutal follow-on attacks, granting you the following benefits:  

* Increase your Dexterity score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with throwing stars.

* You can draw a throwing star as part of the attack you make with it.

* Once per turn, when you hit a creature with an attack using a throwing star that did not suffer from disadvantage, you can gain advantage on the next melee weapon attack or unarmed strike you make against that creature this turn.
