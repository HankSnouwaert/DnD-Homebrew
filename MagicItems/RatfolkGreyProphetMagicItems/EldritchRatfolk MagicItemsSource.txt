## Eldritch Ratfolk Magic Items
These magic items have been crafted using the mystic powers of the grey prophets, and many are specifically designed to aid spellcasters. These items often offer great power, but at a dreadful cost.

#### Eye of the Vermin God
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 6,000 gp*

*This smooth orb continuously glints with a faint red light, as if reflecting an unseen source, regardless of surrounding illumination. It grants the holder the ability to call upon the children of the Vermin God to act as their eyes.*

While attuned to this item, you ignore the one-familiar limitation of the *Find Familiar* spell and can have up to three familiars, provided all are **Rats**. If you attempt to summon a familiar that is not a **Rat**, all existing familiars disappear.

#### Hex-Stone Amulet
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 36,000 gp*

*This pendant, crafted from rough-cut stones, emits a sickly green light. When grasped tightly in dire moments, it fills the user with unholy resilience for a fleeting moment before exacting a terrible toll.*

Whenever you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it, but you must use the new result. You then gain one level of Fatigue*.

#### Hex Stone Token 
*Wonderous Item, Rare, 200g*

*These palm-size wafers of magical minerals can be consumed to boost one's magical abilities. However, their hazardous nature means most non-ratfolk creatures aren't willing to take such a reckless risk for the extra power.*

While in possession of one or more hex stone tokens, you can use an Action to eat any number of tokens to regain one expended spell slot of your choice. If the expended slot level is higher than the number of tokens eaten, the new slot level is equal to the number of tokens eaten. You must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking an amount of Necrotic damage based on the number of tokens eaten on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This damage and hit point maximum reduction can't be reduced or prevented in any way except by succeeding on the saving throw, and it lasts until you finish a long rest. 

The amount of Necrotic damage taken and DC of the saving throw depend on the number of tokens eaten, as shown in the Hex Stone Token Table below.

##### Hex Stone Token Table 
| Number of Tokens  | Save DC |  Damage  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  | 13 | 2d6|
|  2  | 14 | 4d6|
|  3  | 16 | 6d6|
|  4  | 17 | 7d6|
|  5  | 19 | 9d6|
|  6  | 22 | 12d6|
|  7  | 23 | 13d6|
|  8  | 24 | 14d6|
|  9  | 27 | 17d6|

#### Gnawfang
*Weapon (Dagger), Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 2,000 gp*

*Carved from a sliver of the Rat God's fang, this alabaster dagger sheds small white fragments when it pierces flesh. These fragments voraciously burrow deeper into the victim’s body, consuming everything in their path.*

Whenever you hit a creature with this dagger, fragments burrow into the target’s flesh, Infesting it. While Infested, the target takes 2d4 Piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature within reach can use an action to attempt a Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC equals your spell save DC) to remove the shards using a weapon or object that deals Piercing or Slashing damage. On a success, the target takes 1d4 damage of the same type, and the effect ends. A creature can make this check with advantage, but the target takes 3d4 damage instead.

#### Grovelmusk Robes
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 12,000 gp*

*These robes are soaked in the essence of terror, exuding fumes that dampen the fear response of those who inhale their bizarre scent.*

You radiate an aura in a 10-foot emanation originating from you. The aura is inactive while you are Incapacitated. You and your allies within the aura have advantage on saving throws against effects that would impose the Frightened condition. You do not suffer additional effects from being Frightened beyond the base condition, such as the forced movement from the *Fear* spell or the action restrictions from the ratfolk’s scurry away feature.

#### Paranoia Stone
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 6,000 gp*

*Anyone who peers into the depths of this smoke-filled crystal ball sees the hostile intent of those around them. However, the animus it reveals is wildly exaggerated, and its fulsome warnings can lead those who fully heed them to turn on even their closest comrades.*

At the start of your turn while you are holding the item, you can choose to become Frightened of all creatures. While Frightened in this way, attacks against you have disadvantage, you have advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks. However, you consider no creatures your allies and cannot willingly accept items, spells, or abilities from other creatures.

#### Staff of Rightful Dominance
*Staff, Very Rare (requires attunement by an Artificer, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 20,000 gp*

*This arcane rod allows its wielder to unleash near-endless waves of suppressive magic that choke and stifle the incantations of inferior practitioners.*

Whenever you cast *Dispel Magic* to end a spell, if the spell slot you used was of a higher level than the spell ended, you regain one expended spell slot. The regained slot must be of a level lower than the slot used to cast *Dispel Magic* and no higher than 4th level.

#### Staff of Ruin
*Staff, Very Rare (requires attunement by a Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 32,000 gp*

*Gripped by many ratfolk prophets throughout the ages, each treacherously slain by another who hungered for its power, this staff can call down the loathsome might of the great Rat God.*

The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with a spell attack while holding the staff, it deals an extra 1d4 damage per ally the target has within 5 feet of it who isn’t Incapacitated (up to three allies).

***Spells.*** While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. (Spell descriptions found at the end of the document.)

| Spell  | Charge Cost |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  *Death Frenzy*  | 1 |
|  *Flensing Ruin*  | 3|
|  *Dreadful Scorch*  | 4 |
|  *Galvanic Bolts*  | 5 |



#### Stone of Flickering Foresight
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 30,000 gp*

*In ratfolk culture, the gallstones of purple worms, when polished with hexed oils, are said to reveal the future on their surface mere moments before events occur. However, such predictions are not always accurate.*

The Stone of Flickering Foresight begins with one false vision. When you make a d20 test (attack roll, ability check, or saving throw), you can peer into the stone and roll a d6. If the d6 result is higher than the number of false visions the stone currently has, you automatically succeed on the d20 test, and the stone gains one false vision. If the d6 result is equal to or lower than the number of false visions, you fail the d20 test.

The stone loses all but one of its false visions at dawn each day.

Hit or miss, invigorating lightning arcs from you and each target in a 5-foot radius. You, each target, and any creature within one or more of these 5-foot emanations must make a Constitution saving throw (creatures may choose to fail). 

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 Lightning damage and becomes Quickened* until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not Quickened.

While Burning, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, it becomes Frightened of you until the start of its next turn and must use its movement to flee from you by the safest available route. If there is nowhere to move, it drops Prone and uses its action to try to extinguish the flames.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You create one additional ray for each spell slot level above 3.

> ##### New Condition: Burning
> The creature has been set ablaze by something that continues to damage it each round until it is extinguished. The default source described here is fire, but other sources could deal different types of damage, such as acid.
> * **Default Damage:** A burning creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the end of each of its turns unless the source that inflicted the condition states otherwise.
> * **Ending the Condition:** As an action, the burning creature can extinguish the fire by dropping prone and rolling on the ground. The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated. For example, another creature could use an action to put out the flames with their cloak or by pouring water on them.
> * **Multiple Sources of Burning:** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.


<br>

> ##### Notes on 2024 Burning Rules
> If you're using the rules for burning described in the 2024 edition of D&D, these are the changes that were made in this document:
> * **Sources of Burning Don't Stack.** If a burning creature would gain this condition again from another source, the new burning effect only replaces the old if it deals more damage each round. Otherwise, it is ignored.
> * **Damage At End of Turn.** Burning damage occurs at the end of a creature's turn rather than the beginning. This gives the creature the chance to try to end the condition before taking the damage, thus giving players more agency when they start burning.

\columnbreak


> ##### New Condition: Fatigue
> The creature experiences debilitating weariness that can accumulate in levels. Each time a creature gains the Fatigue condition, its Fatigue Level increases by 1. If the level reaches 6, the creature dies. Fatigue Levels have the following effects on a creature:
> * **d20 Rolls:** When a creature makes a d20 Test, subtract its Fatigue Level from the d20 roll.
> * **Spell Save DCs:** Subtract a creature's Fatigue Level from the Spell Save DC of any spell it casts.
> * **Speed** A creature's speed is reduced by a number of feet equal to 5 x its Fatigue level. This can't lower its speed below 5 feet.
> 
> **Ending the Condition:** Completing a Long Rest reduces a creature's Fatigue Level by 1.
> 
> **Fatigue vs. Exhaustion:** Fatigue is an alternative mechanic to the Exhaustion condition, and any ability that removes levels of Exhaustion or grants immunity to it does the same for Fatigue. 

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Wounds
> While most creatures are wounded in combat, in this context, the wound is a special form of injury that causes severe bleeding over a short period of time and only specialized attacks and effects can cause wounds. A creature can suffer from multiple wounds at once and at the end of its turn, a wounded creature takes 2 (1d4) necrotic damage for every wound it has sustained. Only creatures with blood (or something equivalent to blood) can suffer wounds. Wounds can be removed in the following ways:
> 
> * When a creature is healed, one wound is removed for every 5 hit points of healing it receives. 
> * A creature can expend one use of a healer's kit to remove two wounds from itself or another creature. 
> * A wounded creature, or another creature within 5 feet of it, can make a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action to remove one wound on a success. For every 5 points by which the check exceeds the DC, an additional wound is removed.
