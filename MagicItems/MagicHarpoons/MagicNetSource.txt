## Magic Nets

#### Anti-Magic Net
*Net, common (DC 13), uncommon (DC 15), rare (DC 17), very rare (DC 18), legendary (DC 19)*

A creature hit by this net must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or lose concentration on any ongoing spells and be unable to cast spells until the start of its next turn. At the start of each turn that it is restrained by the net, the creature must succeed on the same saving throw or be subjected to the effects again until the start of its next turn. The DC of this Concentration save is determined by the rarity of the net.
