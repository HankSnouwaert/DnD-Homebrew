## Magic Harpoons




### Magic Harpoon Spears

#### Battle Anchor 
*Harpoon spear, rare*

Only the mightiest of nautical warriors can wield this massive anchor. This weapon has the heavy and two handed properties, its attacks deal 2d6 piercing damage, and creatures wielding it must have a Strength of 14 or higher to make attacks with it without disadvantage. 

When you strike a creature with the anchor, you can choose not to tether it and instead deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing. If a creature dealt bludgeoning damage this way is Huge or smaller, it is knocked back 10 feet. 

Additionally, a Huge or smaller creature tethered by the anchor moves at half its speed. 

#### Combat Angler's Fishing Rod
*Harpoon spear, rare*

This weapon takes the form of an enchanted fishing pole. As an action, you can add rope to the pole, which then automatically creates a fishing hook at the end.

This weapon functions like a normal harpoon spear with the following exceptions:
* Ranged attacks made with this weapon are made by throwing the fishing hook out at targets rather than throwing the weapon itself, though it can still only tether one target at a time and can't be used to make attacks while it is tethering a target.

* The distances for ranged attacks made with this weapon increase to 60/200. 
* Melee attacks made with this weapon deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing and cannot tether targets.  
* Whenever a creature you can see makes a bite attack, you may use your reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against it with this weapon. If this attack hits, the creature has disadvantage on the bite attack. You cannot make this attack if you already have a creature tethered with the pole.

#### Electro-Harpoon
*Harpoon spear, very rare (requires attunement)*

This harpoon contains a magical apparatus capable of electrifying it and its tether. As an action, you can electrify the tether between yourself and a harpooned target. Each creature directly between you and the harpoon must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity save or take 4d6 lightning damage. The harpooned target automatically fails this save.

#### Threading Needle
*Harpoon spear, rare*

This giant magical sewing needle is said to have been crafted by eccentric fey lords. When you tether a creature with this weapon, the needle pierces through the target, and if you have a free hand, you may have it automatically fly back to that hand while keeping a hold of the tethering thread. 

Holding the tether still occupies one of your hands. However, you can tether additional creatures with this needle, and each tether made with the needle can be maintained with the same hand. The needle deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage per creature it is tethering. 

Each tethered creature must still stay within 60 feet of you to maintain the tether. If a tethered creature succeeds on a tug-of-war check to pull you by the tether, rather than pull you or snap the tether, it magically moves through the thread and frees itself. 

If the tether is cut, each tethered creature is freed. You may use an action to reapply a rope to the needle, which turns the rope into more magical thread.

#### Underworld Skewers
*Harpoon spear, rare (requires attunement)*

These ghastly harpoons are said to be forged in the underworld and made for hunting wayward spirits. The harpoons come in a set of 10 that are all bound to a quiver. To attune to them, you must be in possession of the quiver, and while attuned, you can use an action to cause all the harpoons to reappear in their quiver.

These harpoons can tether incorporeal creatures normally immune to the grappled condition, and the tethers attached to these harpoons take on a ghostly quality and cannot be cut, though they can still be snapped through Strength checks. 

While one or more of these harpoons are impaled in any creatures within 60 feet of you, you may use an action to call all the harpoons back, causing them to rip themselves free and deal their weapon damage to the creatures they were impaling before flying back to their quiver. The harpoons phase through all obstacles to reach their quiver.


### Magic Harpoon Guns

#### Self-Reeling Harpoon Gun
*Harpoon gun, uncommon (+1, +2, or +3 Str Mod), rare (+4 Str Mod), or very rare (+5 Str Mod)*

The harpoon gun contains a magical pully system that reels in tethered targets at the wielder's command. When you make an opposed Strength check against a creature tethered with this weapon to pull it or avoid being pulled by it, you can apply the weapon's modifier rather than your Strength modifier to the check. The value of the weapon's modifier depends on its rarity.
