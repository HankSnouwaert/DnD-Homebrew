## Ratfolk Magic <br> Items of Blight
These items are sacred relics tended to by blight priests of the ratfolk. When not in use, they are often kept at sites sacred to the Church of Decay, where they can be venerated. Most are weapons and scepters endowed with unnatural toxins and contagions that can unleash virulent diseases or toxic death clouds upon their victims. Only those deemed worthy by the Church are normally allowed to wield them, but sometimes, these items can fall into the hands of outsiders bold or deranged enough to try to use them.

#### Blade of Nurgskritch
*Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement), 1,500 gp*

*Forged by the ratfolk ages ago in blighted swamps and cooled in the befouled blood of fallen celestials, this weapon drips with infection. For generations, it has been wielded by the leaders of the Church of Decay, spreading pestilence in their wake.*

While holding this weapon, you can cast the *plague** spell with it (DC 15). The sword can’t cast this spell again until the next dawn.

While holding this weapon and concentrating on a *plague* spell, your concentration can't be broken due to taking damage.

If you hit a creature with this weapon on your turn while a *plague* spell you cast is active, it becomes infected by that spell.

#### Book of Blight  
*Wondrous item (holy symbol, arcane focus, druidic focus), very rare (requires attunement), 19,200 gp*  

*To the malignant followers of the Church of Decay, no text is more sacred than the Book of Blight. Bound in mottled leather and inked with putrid bile, its foul pages contain the darkest secrets of pestilence, written by the vilest of Blight Bishops, malignant entities of rot, and even the great and cruel Vermin God himself. So corrupted is this tome that merely reading its loathsome passages can cause diseases to manifest from nothing, infecting any unfortunate soul within earshot of the sermon.*

Whenever you cast a spell of 1st level or higher that deals necrotic damage and forces one or more creatures to make a Constitution saving throw, you may roll on the **Plague Symptom** table of the *plague* spell (described at the end of the document). Each creature that failed its save creature has disadvantage on d20 tests using the ability you rolled on the table until the end of your next turn. If the creature fails the save by 10 or more, it also suffers the Severe Symptom associated with the ability until the end of your next turn.

#### Bubonic Scepter  
*Wondrous item (holy symbol, arcane focus, druidic Focus), rare (requires attunement), 4,000 gp* 

*At first glance, the strange scepter appears to be carved from green stone. But upon closer inspection, its surface glistens and pulses with a sickly sheen. This implement of decay brims with accumulated illnesses harvested from the deepest, darkest jungles. Those who wield it can unleash these vile afflictions upon unsuspecting foes.*  

While holding this scepter, you can cast the *plague** spell at 3rd level (DC 15). The scepter can’t cast this spell again until the next dawn. While holding the scepter, you may infect creatures with your *plague* spell even if they were already infected by the spell.  

Whenever you cast a spell that deals necrotic damage and forces one or more creatures to make a Constitution saving throw, if a creature fails the save on the first turn the spell was cast, you may choose for it to become infected by an active *plague* spell you have cast. 

**New spell described at end of document*

#### Censer of the Madding Blight  
*Weapon (blight censer), very rare (requires attunement), 6,000 gp*  
*This grim iron censer is fashioned in the visage of a demonic vermin, its twisted metallic mouth spewing noxious fumes. The bearer of this unholy relic can instill a rabid fervor in those who inhale its sickening vapors.*  

Once during your turn, when you deal necrotic damage to another creature with the blight censer, you may allow the creature to use its reaction to make a single melee weapon attack against a target within reach.  

#### Flail of Pestilence  
*Weapon (flail), very rare (requires attunement) 16,000 gp*

*Said to be crafted from the growths and encrusted pus spewed out by a demon of decay, this flail inflicts those it strikes with demonic rot.*  

When you hit a creature with an attack using this weapon, it gains a level of Pestilence for the next minute or until you attack another creature with this weapon. If it gains five or more levels of Pestilence, it loses all levels and must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw.  

On a failed save, roll on the **Plague Symptom** table of the *plague* spell (described at the end of the document). The creature becomes infected and has disadvantage on d20 tests using the ability you rolled on the table for the next minute. If it fails the saving throw by 5 or more, it also suffers the associated Severe Symptom from the table while infected.  

#### Living Cyst  
*Wondrous item, rare*  
*(requires attunement by a spellcaster), 1,000 gp*  

*This vile pustule possesses a malignant intellect and can transfer between hosts, afflicting its carrier with maddening ravings that drive them into a frenzy.*

To attune to this cyst, you must hold it against your skin for the entire attunement period, whereupon it painfully embeds itself into you.  

While attuned, a creature bonded to the cyst may choose to transfer it to another willing creature within 5 feet at the end of its turn. At the start of its turn, the host can choose to enter a fevered frenzy, taking 3d6 psychic damage, which cannot be reduced in any way, and gaining advantage on all attack rolls until the end of the turn.  

***Symbiotic Nature.*** Every full minute that passes while you remain attuned to the cyst and it is more then 100 feet away form you, you take 3d6 psychic damage, which cannot be reduced in any way. You cannot voluntarily end your attunement to it unless the cyst allows it. If you are targeted by a spell that ends a curse, your attunement to the cyst ends, and it detaches from your body.  

***Sentience.*** The cyst is a sentient, chaotic evil entity with the following attributes:  
- **Intelligence** 8  
- **Wisdom** 8  
- **Charisma** 12  
- It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 30 feet.  
- It understands Common and Undercommon, and can communicate telepathically with the creature it is attached to.  

***Personality.*** The cyst rants with zeal, as if preaching to a congregation, endlessly raving about the world's inevitable end through ravaging plagues. It urges its hosts to bring ruin and destruction to everything around them.

#### Plague Blade
*Weapon (greatsword), rare (requires attunement), 3,000 gp*  

*Steeped time and again in rotting bile, decayed flesh, and other rancid fluids, this weapon has absorbed countless pathogens into its very core. Those who wield it can summon forth numerous plagues.*  

At dawn each day, roll three times on the **Plague Symptom** table from the *plague* spell (described at the end of the document) and record the abilities you rolled.  

When you hit a creature with the blade, you may choose to expend one of the recorded abilities, forcing it to make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw.  

On a failed save, the creature becomes infected for one minute or until you attempt to infect another creature with the weapon. While infected, it has disadvantage on all d20 tests related to that ability and suffers from the Severe Symptom associated with it. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.  

On a successful save, the creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes using the chosen ability before the end of your next turn.  

At dawn each day, you lose the abilities you rolled from the previous day and must roll again.

\pagebreakNum



#### Rod of Corruption  
*Weapon (blight censer), very rare (requires attunement), 10,000 gp*  
 
*The staff’s gnarled length ends in a dark metal cap, from which a trio of spike-covered censers dangle on ornate chains. As it swings, fumes of pure rot spill forth, blackening flesh and reducing the unfortunate to mulch. Only the most resilient plague worshipers can wield this weapon without succumbing to its blighted power.*

When you release putrid incense from this blight censer, you may have it deal 3d8 necrotic damage in a 15-foot emanation rather than 2d4 in a 10-foot emanation.

Necrotic damage dealt by the censer ignores resistance to necrotic damage and treats immunity to necrotic damage as though it was resistance.

### New Spell

#### Plague  
*1st-level necromancy*  
**Casting Time:** 1 bonus action  
**Range:** Self  
**Components:** S, M (a bit of rodent fur)  
**Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute  
**Classes:** Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard  

You become surrounded by pestilence for the duration of the spell.  

At the end of each of your turns, you may choose to infect a creature that you can see within 5 feet of you or within 5 feet of a creature already infected by this spell with disease. Then, each diseased creature makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 necrotic damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and is no longer infected by the disease and can't become infected by the spell again. All diseases disappear when the spell ends.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3.

- If you use a **3rd-level or higher** spell slot, choose an ability from the **Plague Symptom** table.  Creatures infected by this spell have Disadvantage on D20 Tests not triggered by this spell.
- If you use a **6th-level or higher** spell slot, the diseased creatures have the Severe Symptom associated with the ability as well.



##### Plague Symptom  
| d6  |Ability  | Severe Symptom |
|:---:|:-----------|:-----------|
|  1  | **Wisdom.** | The creature can use its action, bonus action, and reaction to only take actions that allow it to make one or more attacks. |
|  2  | **Charisma.** |  Any attack that hits the creature scores a critical hit on a roll of 15-20 |
|  3  | **Constitution.** | The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and checks|
|  4  | **Intelligence.** | The creature is dazed. (New condition described below) |
|  5  | **Strength.** | The creature deals only half damage with attacks. |
|  6  | **Dexterity.** | The creature cannot benefit from the Dash, Disengage, or Dodge actions. Additionally, if the creature chooses to move more than 5 feet on its turn, it uses its movement to travel in a random direction, determined by rolling a d8.

<br>

> ##### New Condition: Dazed 
> A dazed creature can’t take reactions and on its turn, it must choose whether it gets a move, an action, or a bonus action; it gets only one of the three.

### New Item: Blight Censers

These insidious weapons have the appearance of a ceremonial censer used for burning incense, but they are shaped into the form of a flail.  Each day, a plague censor can be filled with toxic incense, and as the censor is swung in combat, it unleashes necrotic fumes deadly to all in the vicinity, including the wielder.    


#### Blight Censer
*melee weapon (martial, flail)*
___
- **Damage:** 1d8
- **Damage Type:** Bludgeoning
- **Properties:** Heavy, two-handed, reach, special
- **Cost:** 50 gp
- **Weight:** 3 lb
___

***Blight Censor.*** When you make an attack with a blight censer, it releases its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.  Each creature in that area takes 1d6 necrotic damage, including the wielder.  Once a blight censer releases its putrid incense, it can't do so again until the next round.

The blight censer must be filled every 24 hours with 10gp worth of putrid incense to maintain this trait.

#### Feat: Blight Censer Fanatic
You've learned how to develop a supernatural bond with a plague censor, drawing perverse fortitude from it even as you are withered by its toxic fumes, and you can use this bond as a focus for your magical abilities.   You gain the following benefits:
* Increase your Strength or Constitution score by 1, to a maximum of 20, or gain proficiency with blight censers.

*  As long as you are wielding a blight censer containing putrid incense, you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your spells, and you can perform the somatic components of spells even when it is occupying both your hands.

* When you cast a spell that has somatic components using your blight censer as your spellcasting focus, you may have it release its putrid incense everywhere within 10 feet of you.

* When you release putrid incense from a blight censer you are wielding, you may have it deal 1d8 necrotic damage rather than 1d6.

* When you take necrotic damage from a blight censer you are wielding, you get +2 to your AC until the start of your next turn or until you stop wielding the plague censor in both hands.
