# Magic Items (Internal Use)



## B

#### Bank of Abundance 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon, 1,000g*

This item looks like a small clay animal with a slit on the top that is two inches wide. You may put any copper, silver, electrum, gold, or platinum coins into the bank using its slit. Any other type of object that is inserted is immediately spat back out. The bank can hold up to 500 pounds worth of coins. The bank weighs 2 pounds, regardless of its contents. 

You may use an action to retrieve coins from the back by holding it upside down and speaking the amount and type of coins you wish for, at which point the requested coins spill out of the bank, assuming they are contained within. The bank cannot release more than 50 coins at one time in this way.

If the bank is overloaded, pierced, or smashed, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane.



#### Blade of Insight 0.0.0
*Weapon (any sword or axe), uncommon (requires attunement)*

This weapon's blade is made of ethereal, psychic energy. This weapon deals psychic damage instead of its normal damage type. Whenever you hit a creature with this weapon, you may learn your choice of the creature's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. You also learn if the creature is proficient with saving throws for the chosen attribute.



#### Bracers of the Last Stand 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon*

These rugged bracers give off a subtle heat you can feel in your soul. If the end draws near, they will fill you with determination, preventing you from falling.  

If damage would reduce you to 0 hit points while wearing these bracers, you can make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the damage taken.  On a success, you instead drop to 1 hit point.  Once you use this feature, you cannot do so again until the next dawn.

Additionally, if you are wearing these bracers while at 1 hit point, your hands burn and glow, shedding bright light out 15 feet and dim light an additional 15 feet.  While your hands are glowing this way, your unarmed strikes deal an additional 1d6 fire damage.

## C



#### Cloak of Daggers 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This cloak is capable of transforming shadows into deadly blades. While you are wearing this cloak in dim light or darkness, you may use a bonus action to draw a dagger from within the shadows of the cape. This dagger is a magic weapon that deals psychic damage rather than piercing. If you drop the dagger, it dissipates. If you use the dagger to make a thrown weapon attack, the dagger dissipates after the attack is resolved. You can only have two daggers drawn from this cloak at a time.

#### Club of Savagery 0.0.0
*Weapon (club), uncommon*

This club has a Savagery Count, which determines the damage die it uses. Whenever you hit a creature with this club, the Savagery Count increases by 1. At the start of each of your turns, if it has been over a minute since you've hit a creature with this weapon, its Savagery Count is reset to 0. The table below determines the damage die used for the club based on its Savagery Count.

| Savagery Count  |  Damage Die      | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|  0          | 1d4 |
|  1          | 1d6      |

|  4          | 1d12   |


#### Crystal Slippers 1.0.0
*Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

This footwear is made from an enchanted crystalline material with a glassy finish.  When you take the disengage action while wearing both slippers, you may also dash as a bonus action.

You can retain your attunement to the slippers even if you lose one, but both slippers are required for the initial attunement. 

A creature holding the lost slipper knows your location as if they cast the *locate creature* spell on you.

#### Dualist's Standard 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon*

If you cast *compelled duel*, you may plant this standard into the ground as part of casting the spell.

## E


#### Enchanted Artisan's Tools 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, uncommon, 500gp*

This item can come in the form of any one of the artisan's tools described in the Player's Handbook. You gain a +1 to any checks made with these tools.  You must have proficiency in the given artisan's tool to gain this benefit.    

#### Echanted Carriage 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, rare, 5,000gp*

This item appears to be an ordinary pumpkin. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the pumpkin to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, it turns into a full-sized carriage. If the space where the carriage would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn't enough space for the carriage, the pumpkin fails to transform. 

When this pumpkin becomes a carriage, you may turn two willing creatures within 60 feet of it into riding horses as though under the effects of the *polymorph* spell. They remain transformed this way until the carriage returns to its pumpkin form.

The item remains as a carriage for 3 hours, after which it reverts to its pumpkin form. It reverts to a pumpkin early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. Once the carriage becomes a pumpkin again, this property can't be used again until midnight.

## G


#### Ghostfire Blade 0.0.0
*Weapon (scimitar), uncommon*

This clear scimitar is made from a glassy material rather than metal, and you may use a free action to cause it to ignite with translucent flames and turn invisible. The only indication of the blade's presence while invisible is a shimmering outline in the form of the scimitar. The weapon still has a physical form and can be picked up and held like any other scimitar. However, it takes a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check for those not attuned to the blade to notice its presence while it is invisible.  

The sword deals fire damage instead of slashing, ignoring resistances and immunities. You may use a free object interaction to turn the weapon visible again. The scimitar will turn visible if it is not being carried or held by you for more than an hour. 

#### Glass Casket 0.0.0
*Wondrous item, rare*

This item is an 8-foot-long coffin made of glass with an AC of 10 and 100hp.

If the coffin is closed and contains a corpse of a medium-sized creature or smaller, the corpse is preserved as though under the effects of the *gentle repose* spell.

Additionally, if the casket is closed and contains a living, unconscious creature, that creature cannot awaken so long as it remains within the closed casket and is under the effects of the *feign death* spell. While in this state, the creature no longer ages.

The casket's traits cease to function while it contains more than one corpse or creature.

## L



#### Light of Restoration 0.0.0
*Wonderous item, legendary, 75,000gp*

This small glass bead contains a glimmering, multicolored light.

You may use your action to speak the bead's command word, releasing the light within. Doing so grants you the benefits of a long rest and neutralizes any poisons, diseases, or curses afflicting you. Once the light has been released, this item becomes an ordinary glass bead.

#### Lucky Charm 1.0.0
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small charm can be attached to any piece of jewelry or clothing.  While wearing it, whenever you make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may roll an additional d20.  You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.  You choose which of the d20s is used for the attack roll, ability check, or saving throw.

If multiple creatures use a lucky charm or luck point granted by the Lucky feat on the same roll, they cancel out, resulting in no additional dice.

Once you use this feature, it can't be used this way again until the next dawn, and a creature that has used a lucky charm can't use another until it takes a long rest.

#### Mantle of Tides 0.0.0
*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This clasp of pearls can absorb up to three gallons of any water it is submerged in. As the clasp absorbs more water, it grows out a long flowing cape of water.

Using the water contained by the clasp, you gain the following options:
