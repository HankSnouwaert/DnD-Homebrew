# Ratfolk Creature Guide
This document contains a collection of resources to help you run adventures heavily featuring ratfolk. Ratfolk forces come in many shapes and sizes, but this guide will focus on what is common to most ratfolk, with a focus on ratfolk soldiers and grey seers. These resources are divided into Encounter Guides, Loot Guides, and Example Encounters. Encounter Guides will help you understand the mindset, motivations, and tactics of the creatures, so you have a better idea of how to play them. Loot Guides provide alternate ways to provide treasure found after defeating these enemies. Example Encounters will provide encounter scenarios involving these creatures and instructions on how to run them.

## Encounter Guides
These guides explore the motivations and tactics of specific creatures to help provide richer roleplaying experiences when using them. Motivations determine the priorities the creature has and what goals it is likely to form based on them. Tactics determine the means through which the creature is most likely to achieve those goals. Motivations and tactics apply when roleplaying wild beasts looking for their next meal, as well as major characters serving as antagonists for an entire campaign.

### Motivations

Understanding a creature's motivations will help you give it goals that may put it into direct conflict with the players. If players can decern that a creature has goals that aren't just "be an enemy for the players to defeat," it will breathe more life into the world and give the players a chance to make more informed decisions as to how to deal with the creature. 

This section of the guide will provide examples of common motivations for these types of creatures in general and specialized motivations for more unique creatures.


### Tactics

Understanding a creature's preferred tactics will help you form a strategy for how the creature will attempt to achieve its goals and guide you in making the most of the creature's abilities. Players who can recognize a creature's tactics will then have a chance to make note of them and attempt to adjust their own tactics accordingly.

This section of the guide will provide examples of how the creatures prefer to initiate combat, what tactics they use during combat, and what they will do if they are losing.

## Loot Guides

The DMG contains Individual Treasure tables listing the number of coins that can be dropped by creatures of different CRs. However, many creatures have no reason to carry coins or even have them within their vicinity. Other creatures may carry wealth in the form of items whose value isn't apparent at first glance. 


And sometimes, items are hidden away in nearby areas that are difficult to spot. How different CRs are split among the tables also results in creatures of wildly different power levels dropping the same amounts of wealth.

You can use these loot guides if you wish to provide your players with alternate sources of wealth when they slay monsters that don't carry money, let players use their skills to collect wealth, or just provide treasure that scales more closely with creature CR.

The guides provide rules for allowing players to loot valuable goods from their foes' corpses or the surrounding area after an encounter. This looting can be done using a skill check made by one of the players, with the type of check required dependent on the type of item the player wishes to collect and how the item is being collected. The more successful the check, the more goods the player is able to collect. 

> ##### What’s Alternate Loot Good For?
>Treasure other than coins, gems, and art objects can be used to provide forms of wealth that better fit the context of the current environment. Players with the right skill sets might also be able to use valuables they find this way to craft useful items. These could be handy mundane items or even magic items. Hide and bone could be crafted into weapons and armor, while potent plants or liquids could form the base for a potion.

## Ratfolk Encounter Guide

The nature of ratfolk and the names they go by varies from setting to setting. However, adventures that pit players against evil ratfolk usually feature them as unscrupulous and underhanded adversaries who utilize stealth and overwhelming numbers to compensate for other shortcomings. Ratfolk often dwell in formerly abandoned towns or the sewers of cities occupied by other humanoids. They may also construct their own hidden settlements underground or within deadly swamps. From these dwellings, they can launch raids into the territory of other races to take whatever they need to survive.  

Players may come into conflict with ratfolk who are launching an attack on other humanoids, or they might stumble across ratfolk lairs in the wild or while exploring urban ruins. The most common types of ratfolk players are likely to encounter are foot soldiers, who range from lowly slaves to mighty warlords leading entire clans. Some ratfolk forces may also include a grey seer who serves as a powerful mystic and spiritual leader for the clan.


### Ratfolk Motivations
Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. Many carry an everpresent sense of fear and inferiority and thus grab at power as a means of mitigating these insecurities. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk with specialized skills will seek mastery in that skill as a means of elevating themselves while also seeking to sabotage any rivals. Lowly ratfolk slaves will leap at any chance to bully another creature, and ratfolk warlords seek to expand the size of their territory and clan. All ratfolk take particular glee in seeing the works of rival races reduced to ruin and will bring about such ruin for its own sake as it facilitates a sense of superiority amongs their kind.

Ratfolk with more mystical inclinations, such as grey seers, may appear to give up this selfish drive in service of their divine calling, but they, too, seek power. Their service is merely a means of gaining access to eldritch powers, which they can use to elevate themselves amongst their clan, and they often walk the fine line between doing what their divine masters require of them and utilizing their gifts to achieve their selfish ends.





#### General Ratfolk Motivations
* Securing resources or territory for a clan
* Bringing ruin upon a feared enemy
* Acquiring items that enhance the ratfolk’s power or can serve as a status symbol
* Increasing status among the clan
* Avoiding the wrath of higher-ranking clan members


#### Grey Seer Motivations
* Serving the will of an otherworldly master
* Securing eldritch lore or powerful magic items
* Gaining influence over other clans

### Ratfolk Tactics
Ratfolk rarely have the advantage over their foes in terms of individual power and must instead rely upon cunning and numbers. Grand strategic goals are pursued using deception, betrayal, and securing large numbers of allies. Ratfolk are opportunistic schemers by nature and can flip from cowering hesitation to brutal aggression the moment they see an opening to pursue their goals. Though ratfolk are quick to backstab one another to pursue their ends, they naturally unite into overwhelming verminous mobs when faced with an outside threat. These tactics carry over into how ratfolk engage the players in combat.

#### Engagement
Ratfolk rarely engage enemies on anything approaching even footing. They don’t start a fight unless they’ve caught the players off-guard, have overwhelming numbers, or have a terrain advantage. If they’re able, ratfolk will surround the players before making their presence known using their natural stealthiness. They will also try to engage in dark and claustrophobic environments where their darkvision and crevice crawler abilities allow them to sneak up from unexpected directions.

#### Combat

So long as they believe they have the upper hand, ratfolk are vicious combatants to the point of recklessness. They will dogpile an isolated or otherwise vulnerable opponent and utilize their Overwhelming Mass feature to rack up brutal amounts of damage. If the players manage to regroup to support whoever is being ganged up on, the ratfolk will scatter using their Scurry Away feature before rallying to reattempt the same tactic. Fighting in an environment with tight spaces the players can’t easily move through helps facilitate this fighting style.


#### Retreat
Ninja ratfolk quickly flee if they find themselves on the back foot, and many of their strategies involve retreating from surprise attacks the moment the players have had the chance to gain their bearings. They will leave the players wounded with their resources drained and wait to strike again when their guard is down to slowly sap the players of their fighting capability. If the players manage to deal severe damage to the ratfolk ninja force and successful counterattacks seem unlikely, they will flee the area entirely. 

Though ninja ratfolk are quick to flee, those who have ascended beyond the rank of night runner rarely due so with the blind panic of ordinary ratfolk. Their disciplined training allows them to maintain a level head, and their retreats are made in a much more tactical manner. 


#### Tactics: Ratfolk Slaves
These wretches are generally used as cannon fodder by other ratfolk. They often spend as much time fleeing the players as they do fighting them. This “strategy” does give them a better shot at using their Cornered Rat ability before they are slain. Ratfolk slaves are also considered so expendable by other ratfolk that seeing them fleeing or slain isn’t a bother, and other ratfolk are unlikely to break and flee as a result.

\pagebreak

#### Tactics: Council Guards
These are the most elite ratfolk soldiers and most atypical of their kind in terms of their combat behavior. Their primary goal is to safeguard their commander, and their Scurry Towards feature lets them intercept players trying to chase down said commander. Council guards will also never flee a fight if doing so would put the commander in jeopardy.

#### Tactics: Grey Seer
Like most spellcasters, grey seers will try to stay out of reach of the players and use minions as a meat shield. Fissure is an excellent spell for creating terrain that impedes the players, and Vermintide can be used to drop tides of rats on players who’ve fallen into the fissure or are trying to attack the grey seer. If players do manage to close into melee range, the warp staff attacks do high damage and prevent reactions, giving the grey seer an opening to retreat.

## Ratfolk Loot Guide
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying what goods are truly valuable items, not just trinkets they were trying to pretend were impressive status symbols.

### Lootable Ratfolk Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Werewolf Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Grey Seer Items |  Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Religion |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. As ratfolk are quick to horde anything they might see as valuable, the difficulty in looting ratfolk often stems from sorting out actual valuables from items that have simply been made to appear valuable. 

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, a Monstrous Bone may be worth 10gp, but a Pristine Monstrous Bone would be worth 20gp, and a Cracked Monstrous Bone would be worth 5gp. Gems may be flawed, hide might be tattered, and metal corroded, cutting their value in half, and any item in pristine condition can be worth twice as much. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort.


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Bone | Gem | Hide | Metal |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1gp |  Rat Bone |  Green Quartz  | Leather Scraps | Blade Fragment |
|  10gp| Monstrous Bone |  Warp Stone  | Armored Leather | Intact Blade |
|  100gp| Trophy Bone |  Warp Gem  | Trophy Hide | Warp-Steel Fragment |
|  1,000gp| Eldritch Horn |  Warp Jewel  | Warp Leather| Warp-Steel Blade |

### Loot Tables
