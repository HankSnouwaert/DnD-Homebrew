# Ninja Ratfolk Creature Guide
This document contains a collection of resources to help you run adventures heavily featuring ratfolk. Ratfolk forces come in many shapes and sizes, but this guide will focus on ratfolk who utilize ninja-like abilities. These resources are divided into Encounter Guides, Loot Guides, and Example Encounters. Encounter Guides will help you understand the mindset, motivations, and tactics of the creatures, so you have a better idea of how to play them. Loot Guides provide alternate ways to provide treasure found after defeating these enemies. Example Encounters will provide encounter scenarios involving these creatures and instructions on how to run them.

## Encounter Guides
These guides explore the motivations and tactics of specific creatures to help provide richer roleplaying experiences when using them. Motivations determine the priorities the creature has and what goals it is likely to form based on them. Tactics determine the means through which the creature is most likely to achieve those goals. Motivations and tactics apply when roleplaying wild beasts looking for their next meal, as well as major characters serving as antagonists for an entire campaign.

### Motivations

Understanding a creature's motivations will help you give it goals that may put it into direct conflict with the players. If players can decern that a creature has goals that aren't just "be an enemy for the players to defeat," it will breathe more life into the world and give the players a chance to make more informed decisions as to how to deal with the creature. 

This section of the guide will provide examples of common motivations for these types of creatures in general and specialized motivations for more unique creatures.


### Tactics

Understanding a creature's preferred tactics will help you form a strategy for how the creature will attempt to achieve its goals and guide you in making the most of the creature's abilities. Players who can recognize a creature's tactics will then have a chance to make note of them and attempt to adjust their own tactics accordingly.

This section of the guide will provide examples of how the creatures prefer to initiate combat, what tactics they use during combat, and what they will do if they are losing.

## Loot Guides

The DMG contains Individual Treasure tables listing the number of coins that can be dropped by creatures of different CRs. However, many creatures have no reason to carry coins or even have them within their vicinity. Other creatures may carry wealth in the form of items whose value isn't apparent at first glance. 


And sometimes, items are hidden away in nearby areas that are difficult to spot. How different CRs are split among the tables also results in creatures of wildly different power levels dropping the same amounts of wealth.

You can use these loot guides if you wish to provide your players with alternate sources of wealth when they slay monsters that don't carry money, let players use their skills to collect wealth, or just provide treasure that scales more closely with creature CR.

The guides provide rules for allowing players to loot valuable goods from their foes' corpses or the surrounding area after an encounter. This looting can be done using a skill check made by one of the players, with the type of check required dependent on the type of item the player wishes to collect and how the item is being collected. The more successful the check, the more goods the player is able to collect. 

> ##### What’s Alternate Loot Good For?
>Treasure other than coins, gems, and art objects can be used to provide forms of wealth that better fit the context of the current environment. Players with the right skill sets might also be able to use valuables they find this way to craft useful items. These could be handy mundane items or even magic items. Hide and bone could be crafted into weapons and armor, while potent plants or liquids could form the base for a potion.

## Ninja Ratfolk Encounter Guide

The nature of ratfolk and the names they go by varies from setting to setting. However, adventures that pit players against evil ratfolk with ninja-like capabilities usually feature them as unscrupulous and underhanded adversaries who utilize speed, stealth, and agility to catch players off-guard and exploit their weaknesses. These ninja ratfolk dwell within secret lairs or hidden dispersed amongst larger populations where they can better remain hidden. 

Players may come into conflict with ninja ratfolk who are launching raids on other humanoids or performing sinister covert operations. Players may be called upon to foil a ninja clan’s attempts at assassination, theft, espionage, or sabotage. They may also be sent to hunt down ninja ratfolk or discover the whereabouts of their masters or the location of their clan’s lair.


### Ninja Ratfolk Motivations


Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk of the ninja clans see obtaining mastery of their deadly arts as the most reliable means of obtaining power and elevating their status. Mastery and status are obtained by carrying out missions on behalf of their clan or whoever is paying for their services. As such, most of their motivations will be tied to carrying out whatever task has been assigned to them. Individuals within the clan may have their own personal agendas, but should they be caught crossing the clan, they will be quickly eliminated.

#### Ninja Ratfolk Motivations
* Carrying out missions on behalf of their clan
* Seeking esoteric knowledge, training, or items to help further the mastery of their art
* Ascending through the ranks of their clan
* Finding formidable challenges to overcome, so as to prove their worth
* Acquiring secrets that can be leveraged for power

### Ninja Ratfolk Tactics
Ninja ratfolk utilize cunning, stealth, and ruthless opportunism to achieve their goals. These tactics apply to both grand strategic goals and moment-to-moment combat maneuvers. They are never obvious about their intentions or how they plan to achieve their ends, and these ratfolk almost always have a trick up their sleeve or some contingency plan to fall back on should they face challenging resistance.

#### Engagement

Ninja ratfolk never engage enemies on fair terms and will always look to strike when and where they are least expected. They usually avoid fights where they can’t dictate how the battle is started and almost always attempt to begin engagements with an ambush. Attacking players under cover of darkness is their preferred method. Still, they may also hide their agents amongst other ratfolk forces and only reveal themselves once the players have left one of their more vulnerable party members open to a sneak attack. 

\columnbreak


Ratfolk ninjas also enjoy attacking players who are engaged with other foes, making it much easier to sneak up on unsuspecting party members. If the players manage to catch them on the back foot, most ratfolk ninjas will attempt to retreat and regroup for a surprise counterattack when the players are more vulnerable.


#### Combat

Ratfolk ninjas all make heavy use of hit-and-run tactics. They rarely stand toe-to-toe with formidable opponents and prefer to focus their attacks on players who are easy to hit and quick to bring down. Their high mobility and ability to disengage from fights make it hard for players to pin them down and easy for them to reach fragile players. 

Beyond these skirmishing strategies, ratfolk ninjas still make use of their standard racial abilities. They attack in groups whenever possible, enabling both their sneak attacks and their Overwhelming Mass ability. Scurry Away and Crevice Crawler also make retreat into tight spaces where players cannot follow all the easier.


#### Retreat
Ninja ratfolk quickly flee if they find themselves on the back foot, and many of their strategies involve retreating from surprise attacks the moment the players have had the chance to gain their bearings. The fact that they can use their Cunning Action feature while frightened as a result of their Scurry Away feature helps facilitate this. 

They will leave the players wounded with their resources drained and wait to strike again when their guard is down to slowly sap the players of their fighting capability. If the players manage to deal severe damage to the ratfolk ninja force and successful counterattacks seem unlikely, they will flee the area entirely. 

Though ninja ratfolk are quick to flee, those who have ascended beyond the rank of night runner rarely due so with the blind panic of ordinary ratfolk. Their disciplined training allows them to maintain a level head, and their retreats are made in a much more tactical manner. 

#### Tactics: Night Runner

Night runners are the least trained and most expendable members of their clans. Though they prefer surprise attacks, they may also attack the players head-on if they see an opportunity, relying on speed and numbers rather than ambushes. They utilize most of the tactics common to other ninja ratfolk but are less sophisticated in their execution of these tactics and are more likely to lose their cool if the battle starts to go awry.

#### Tactics: Triads of Duplicity
Invoke Duplicity can be used in several ways. It can be kept close to the triad, boosting the triad’s combat power, or moved around the battlefield to set up more elaborate ploys. These could include initiating combat with illusions to trick players into wasting spells on fake enemies while the real triads launch an ambush, using the illusions to facilitate a retreat, or using illusions to trick the players into thinking they’re outnumbered.

\pagebreakNum

#### Tactics: Ninja Assassins and Master Assassins
These ratfolk are one-hit wonders. Most of their damage output depends on them comboing a Sneak Attack with Assassinate on the first round of combat. After that, they aren’t much better than death runners. If they aren’t winning the fight after the first round of combat, most assassins will retreat unless they have been charged with leading larger attack forces.


#### Tactics: Deathmaster
The deathmaster is the most powerful ninja ratfolk and a boss enemy with a unique attack style. Like most ninja ratfolk, it is relatively fragile and won't do well standing toe-to-toe with players. Instead, it will make heavy use of its Slink ability to retreat into hiding before making its next attack. Its Slip and Shank legendary actions even allow it to do this multiple times in a round. And its Slip Away bonus action should keep it from ever getting pinned down for more than a round.

The deathmaster shouldn't make attacks that leave it out in the open and within melee range of the players. It will bide its time in hiding while it waits for an opening, moving from location to location and taking the Dodge and Hide actions. Its high Intelligence and Wisdom allow it to size up the strengths and weaknesses of the players as though it can read the stats off their character sheets. Fragile spell casters and characters with high Perception will be the highest priority targets. 

If the deathmaster can secure Sneak Attacks using its throwing stars, it can keep its distance from the players while still racking up heavy damage. Though, an alternate strategy could involve attacking many different players with weeping blades to coat them all in acid, thereby forcing them to use up their actions cleaning off the acid or accept damage and armor degradation each turn. The Whirl of Weeping blades legendary action is also effective at applying acid to many players at once, though it should generally be reserved for situations where the deathmaster has been surrounded and doesn't have a clear method of escape. 

\columnbreak

### Ninja Ratfolk Quick Tips

* Cunning Actions can be used while frightened.

#### Gutter Runners & Death Runners

* If you can sneak attack with your throwing star, you don’t have much reason to move into melee

* If you can’t sneak attack with your throwing star, you can use it to set up a sneak attack with your sword if you have no other way of  getting a sneak attack off

#### Death Runners

* Nimble Reflexes is easy to forget. Don’t let your players shoot down these enemies that easily!

#### Death Runners of Renown

* Don’t be shy about using Scurry and Dodge. It will keep these rats alive.

#### Triads

* Hitting multiple players with weeping blades can force more of them to use up their actions scraping off the acid.
 
#### Triads of Duplicity

* Mark which illusion is paired with each triad to make tracking them in combat easier.
* Whenever possible, have the triad and its illusion attack the same target at the same time to make it harder for players to tell which one is real.

#### Ninja Assassins and Master Assassins

* Your top priority is landing a Sneak Attack with your Assassinate feature in the first round of combat.

#### The Deathmaster
* Slink and Shank are your bread-and-butter moves for slipping in and out of combat
* Get your Sneak Attack in every round. If you don’t have allies, do this by hiding, turning invisible, or setting it up with a Toxic Star attack.
* Spend as much time hidden between attacks as possible.

## Ratfolk Loot Guide
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying what goods are truly valuable items, not just trinkets they were trying to pretend were impressive status symbols.

### Lootable Ratfolk Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Ninja Ratfolk Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Ninja Sorcerer Items |  Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Religion |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. As ratfolk are quick to horde anything they might see as valuable, the difficulty in looting ratfolk often stems from sorting out actual valuables from items that have simply been made to appear valuable. 

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, a Monstrous Bone may be worth 10gp, but a Pristine Monstrous Bone would be worth 20gp, and a Cracked Monstrous Bone would be worth 5gp. Gems may be flawed, hide might be tattered, and metal corroded, cutting their value in half, and any item in pristine condition can be worth twice as much. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort.


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Bone | Gem | Hide | Metal |Liquid |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1gp |  Rat Bone |  Green Quartz  | Leather Scraps | Blade Fragment | Vial of Toxins |
|  10gp| Trophy Skull |  Warp Stone  | Armored Leather | Intact Blade | Vial of Poisons |
|  100gp| Etched Skull |  Warp Gem  | Runed Leather | Warp-Steel Fragment | Vial of Warp-Venom |
|  1,000gp| Warlord's Skull |  Warp Jewel  | Warp Leather | Warp-Steel Blade | Vial of Daemon-Venom |

\columnbreak

### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

# Example Ninja Ratfolk Encounters

##### Encounter Map: Storage Depot

## The Night Watch <br> (Player Levels: 7-9)
In this encounter, the players have been tasked with protecting a supply depot housing dangerously magical minerals until they can be picked up for transport in the morning. However, a group of ninja ratfolk attempts to use the powers of illusion and misdirection to outmaneuver the players and take the minerals for themselves.


### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have accepted the task of guarding the supply depot for the night. How much they know about what's in the depot or how they came about this job is up to you. The less knowledge they have of the ninja ratfolk and their tactics before hand, the more likely they are to fall for their ruses.




<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

##### Map Legend
* **White T:** Real Triad in Hiding
* **Teal T:** Illusionary Triad Whose Number Corresponds to the Matching Real Triad
* **Red T:** Real Triad Drawing Players' Attention
* **R:** Ratfolk Gutter Runner (Optional)

<br>

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** It is pitch black outside. The players may light torches wherever they see fit within the depot or on its exterior during their watch. <br>
* **The Depot.** The building is a 10-foot tall wooden structure with boarded-up windows along all its sides. Every part of the structure has an AC 14, and if 25 points of damage are dealt to a single location, a hole large enough for 1 Small creature will be created. 
* **Warp Stone.** This unnatural mineral contains immense magical power and is toxic to touch if handled improperly. A creature with thick leather or metal gloves can use an action to pick up and stow a hand full of stones. A creature without such protection immediately takes 2d6 radiant damage and takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns while carrying the stones without protection.
* **Cover Areas.** The bushes and rocks on the map can be used as half-cover.

### Running the Encounter
The encounter involves 5 ratfolk triads of duplicity. The triads approach from different directions, as shown on the map. One group is a distraction team and consists of two real triads and three of the illusions the triads can create using their Invoke Duplicity feature. One of the real triads of the distraction team will pretend to stealthily approach the depot but make noise so as to draw the attention of the players. 

Players who notice the noisy triad can tell it is deliberately trying to be noticed if they have a passive Insight of 14 or higher. The other triads will attempt to remain hidden with stealth checks but may be spotted by players with a high enough Passive Perception and are close enough to their hiding locations to see or hear them.

If the players engage the distraction team, those triads and their illusions will fight defensively to try to keep the players occupied while the other triads sneak up to the depot at the Attack Points listed on the map and use their weeping blades to cut through the walls. The walls can be covered in acid and will take damage each round, as described in the description for the triad’s Weeping Blade attack. If there is a player within 30 feet of a triad attempting to cut through a wall, it must make a Sleight of Hand check contested by that player’s Passive Perception to attack the wall without being noticed.

Triads who make it into the depot will start grabbing handfuls of warp stone before retreating. You can use your judgment as to how much warp stone any given triad tries to grab, but it generally won’t try to grab more if it risks getting attacked by a player soon.

If the players don’t immediately engage the triad distraction team, that team may make a retreat in an attempt to draw the players into a chase. If the players don’t give chase, all the triads may regroup and attempt a more direct attack on the depot.

If the players spot the triads breaking into the depot, things will escalate into a full-blown fight. You can use the guidance in the Ninja Ratfolk Encounter guide, but there are a few additional tactics to consider:

* Because the acid from the weeping blade damages the walls over time, the triads should leave wall sections eroding before engaging players
* If the ratfolk have already secured some warp stone, illusions can be used to distract players while they make their escape
* Triads can pick up satchels of warp stone dropped by other slain triads


### Aftermath
Any ratfolk that manage to escape with warp stone will attempt to curry it back to their hideout. Players may be able to give chase to retreating ratfolk, and you can use the chase rules described in the DMG to resolve such an encounter. If the ratfolk fail to steal any warp stone and suffer heavy casualties, they are unlikely to make further attempts that night.

\columnbreak

#### Loot
The players can loot the bodies of any ratfolk they slay, but the majority of their treasure will come from the reward they earn for guarding the depot. If the players prevent any warp stone from being stolen, they will be paid 1,000gp. For every handful of warp stone taken, reduce the payment by 200gp. If they successfully protect all the warp stone and slay all the would-be thieves, their clients may give them an extra token of appreciation, such as gems or a few consumable magic items.


#### XP Award: 6,000xp
The degree of success the players have in protecting the warp stone can affect their XP reward. If the players slay all the ratfolk, you can increase the XP to 8,000. For every handful of warp stone they lose, reduce the awarded XP by 1,000xp, to a minimum of 1,000xp.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Remove either triad T4 or T5 from the encounter. Change the baseline XP to 5,000xp.

**Harder Encounter.** Include a pair of **ratfolk gutter runners**, who appear as a backup to the triads sneaking from the back of the depot. They will either ambush players fighting those triads, or attempt to grab and run off with warp stone if the opportunity presents itself. Change the baseline XP to 10,000xp, and increase the XP reduction increments from 1,000xp to 2,000xp.



### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | This attack was one of many to occur on the same night, and most of the other attacks were not successfully repelled. The players are tasked with recovering the stolen warp stone. |
|  2  | The warp stone is deemed too dangerous to exist, and the players are tasked with finding a way to safely destroy it or neutralize its properties. |
|  3  | The players are asked to guard the warp stone as it is being transported to a more secure location. The ratfolk attempt to intercept the warp stone using more direct means. |
|  4  | The players unknowingly serve another rival ratfolk clan using the warp stone to power their insidious inventions. |




\pagebreakNum



## The Shadowy Hideout <br> (Player Levels: 9-11)
In this encounter, the players are sneaking into a secret ninja ratfolk clan base hidden deep in the sewers. There they will face off against a ratfolk ninja sorcerer leading his deadly disciples. 


### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players are aware of the ratfolk hideout in the sewers and have made it their mission to eliminate the ratfolk and their leader. This may be the final encounter of a dungeon crawl through the sewers to find the base, or it may be a one-off side quest. 

### Lead Up
If the players manage to sneak up on the ratfolk, they will be in the locations shown on the map and not have any time to prepare. If the ratfolk hear the players coming, the sorcerer will cast *toxic coating* on one of the gutter runner's weapons, and they will all go into hiding so they can lie and wait for the players. 


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The only light in the room is provided by the candles on the raised platform near the top of the map. The candles keep the platform brightly lit out to 5 feet and shed dim light an additional 5 feet.
* **Elevated Areas.**  The areas of the map highlighted in green are at a higher elevation than the ground floor of the hideout’s entrance. The height difference is described in the map. The ceiling is 15 feet above the wooden floor.
* **Secret Door.** There is a secret door built into the wall of the hideout (marked in red on the encounter map) that the players can find with a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Opening the door without alerting the ratfolk in the hideout requires a successful DC 14 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The doorway is just large enough for a Medium creature to move through it by squeezing.
* **Trap Doors.** The trap doors hidden throughout the base allow the ratfolk to access the crawlspace under the floor. They can be spotted by players with a successful DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check. Once the players have spotted one door, checks made to spot others are made with advantage.
* **Pillars.** There are four pillars in the middle of the hideout that can provide total cover to Medium or smaller creatures directly behind them.

### Encounter Tactics
If the ratfolk manage to ambush the players, they will press their advantage to the fullest and attempt to severely wound fragile characters while they have the players on the back foot. After this point, their attacks will be directed by the sorcerer, and they will do what they can to protect him and take advantage of the spells he casts.

##### Map Legend
* **S:** Ratfolk Ninja Sorcerer 
* **G:** Ratfolk Gutter Runner
* **T:** Ratfolk Triad
* **D:** Trap Door




#### Ratfolk Triads
The triads should generally focus on keeping as many players coated in acid as possible, weaving in and out of combat using their Cunning Action. They will only stop to dogpile vulnerable or isolated players.

#### Ratfolk Gutter Runners
The gutter runners will make the most use of the trap door system and use them to pop up and sneak attack soft targets, players whose AC has been eroded by acid, or players under the effects of the *brittle bones* spell.  

If they can start their turn hidden, they will make throwing star attacks, and if they can get a sneak attack this way, they will not bother with attempting to move into melee range. Gutter runners will generally keep their distance from players if they can help it, using their Cunning Action to stay out of reach. Moving in to use their short sword is usually only optimal if the gutter runner needs to do so to secure a sneak attack.

#### The Ratfolk Ninja Sorcerer
This sneaky spell caster primarily uses his spells to support his minions while staying out of reach of the players. What spells he casts will depend on whether he has the chance to prepare and what minions he has at his disposal. Below are tips on how to use his spells:

##### Pre-combat Spells

&emsp;***Haste.*** If you add an especially powerful creature, like an **assassin**, the sorcerer will be inclined to cast this spell on it. To maintain concentration, the sorcerer will take extra care to avoid attacks from the players.

***Pass Without Trace.*** Useful if the sorcerer has 5 or more weaker minions within range and they are going to attempt to sneak up on the players.

***Toxic Coating.*** If the sorcerer's minions are spread out and can't make use of *pass without trace*, he can chose the minion with the highest attack bonus and use this spell on one of its weapons.

##### Combat Spells
&emsp;***Black Whirlwind.*** This is the best opening spell, and the sorcerer will use it whenever he can hit three or more players with the spell at once.

***Brittle Bones.*** Once the sorcerer is no longer maintaining concentration on any spells he cast before combat, he will cast this spell on whichever targetable player has the lowest bonus to Constitution saving throws (the sorcerer is very intelligent and can usually determine which player this will be.)

***Darkness.*** The sorcerer will use this spell to provide its minions with areas to hide if there is nothing available for them on the battlefield. The spell can also be used in place of *smoke shroud* if it has no more uses of that spell left.

***Silence.*** The sorcerer will use this niche spell if there are two or more spell-casting players he can interfere with using it.

***Smoke Shroud.*** The sorcerer will save this spell for the turns during which it's frightened as a result of its Scurry Away feature.

***Spider Climb.*** This is primarily a way for the sorcerer to escape the players by climbing up the walls of his hideout.

### Aftermath 
The players' goal is to slay the sorcerer and his minions, so their mission is complete if they succeed in this. If the ratfolk are losing the fight, they will most likely try to flee, which may result in the players having to hunt them down through the sewers. What any ratfolk escapees do after they flee and the follow-up missions the players receive will depend on whether you want to fit this encounter into a larger campaign.

#### Loot 
If the players search the crawl space beneath the floor, they'll find several chests containing a total of approximately 5,000 sp and 2,300 gp. If they succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check, they'll find a hidden chest containing approximately 100 pp. 

The lair is filled with random supplies, many of which are alchemical in nature. A DC 14 check made using Intelligence (Nature), Intelligence (alchemist's supplies), or Intelligence (poisoner's kit) will reveal approximately 1,000 gp worth of poisons and alchemical ingredients.

At your discretion, you can also have magic items crafted by the sorcerer hidden within the lair.

#### XP Award: 10,000xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the ratfolk can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **150% XP:** All the ratfolk are slain.
* **100% XP:** Most of the ratfolk are slain, but one or two minions escaped.
* **50% XP:** Most of the ratfolk are slain, but the sorcerer or a large number of minions escaped.
* **10% XP:** The players were forced to flee before slaying the sorcerer.


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Replace the gutter runners with night runners. Change the XP award to 6,000xp.

**Harder Encounter.** Replace the gutter runners with death runners. Change the XP award to 15,000xp.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The entire sewer system is riddled with ratfolk hideouts and other monsters, and the players are being paid to "clean up house" beneath the city. |
|  2  | In retaliation for the destruction of their hideout, the ratfolk's clan members carry out a series of brutal assassinations against the leadership of the city above. |
|  3  | The players are sent deep into the wilderness to find the reclusive ratfolk clan master so their leadership can be destroyed from the top. |
|  4  | The ratfolk below the city have been pulling strings to push the populace into a civil war. The ratfolk have been dealt with, but it may be too late to stop what they put into motion.|

## The Assassin's Trap <br> (Player Levels: 11-13)
In this encounter, the players are charged with protecting a dwarven lord during his journey to a dwarven keep. As the players and the dwarf arrive at the keep, a trap is sprung by a ratfolk assassin and his squad or ratfolk death runner minions as they attempt to assassinate the dwarf. 


### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players are escorting a dwarven lord back to his keep. He has somehow become separated from his kin and has accepted the players' aid as he attempts to make it home in one piece. His dwarven companions may have been killed by ratfolk, leaving him well aware that he has been marked for death.

### Lead Up
Before they reach the hold, the dwarf will inform the players that its walls are warded to prevent teleportation magic from breaching their perimeter. However, teleportation can still be used within the confines of any given room. The walls also cannot be affected by magic that shapes stone and prevents creatures from moving through them by magical means. Only spells of 4th level or higher can overcome these wards.

When the dwarf reaches the front gate and sees no guards on duty, he speaks a command word, causing the gate to magically crank itself open. If the players inquire about this, he tells them that the ability to command the gates open is a privilege privy only to dwarven lords.

The players and the dwarf enter the apparently empty antechamber, which is illuminated by torches around the dwarven statues. When the dwarf reaches the center of the room, the gate everyone came through slams shut, the lights go out, and the ratfolk attack.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The entire room is illuminated in bright light when the players enter. But once the ratfolk spring their trap, the magically put out all the lights.
* **Statues.** The  statues stand 20 feet tall and can be climbed with a successful DC 12 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Pillars.** The room's pillars reach up to the ceiling and are too smooth to be climbed by ordinary means.
* **Gates.**  The metal gates at either end of the chamber are closed and prevent the use of teleportation magic through them. The gates have an AC 19 and a damage threshold of 10 (meaning attacks and effects that deal less than 10 damage do nothing to them). Dealing 27 damage to a single section creates a hole large enough for a Small creature to squeeze through. Dealing an additional 27 damage increases the size to allow a Medium creature to squeeze through. 
* **Gate Crank.** The cranks normally obey the commands of the dwarf lord and can be operated manually. However, they have been sabotaged by the ratfolk to magically lock themselves at their command. An Intelligence (Investigation) check of 20 or higher of a crank before the trap is sprung will reveal it has been tampered with.

##### Map Legend

* **D:** Ratfolk Death Runner

<br><br>

Once the trap is sprung, the magic that disabled the cranks is no longer present, and someone within 5 feet of a crank can use an action to make a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to disable the locks. Once the crank is unlocked, a creature can use an action to make a DC 12 Strength check to open the gate 5 feet. The gate crank shown on the map operates the lower gate the players came through. Another gate crank on the other side of the northern gate operates that gate and has been sabotaged the same way. 

The ratfolk do not need to make a check to unlock the cranks and can use them as an action, which they will do in order to flee.

> ##### Preparing Spells In Advance
> As stated in the Lead Up, players cannot use spells lower than 4th level to teleport out of the room, shape the stone of the interior, or move through the walls or gate. It may be helpful for players who prepare their spells at the start of the day to know this well in advance, so they can pick their spells appropriately.

### Encounter Tactics
The top priority of the ratfolk is killing the dwarf and escaping. The top priority of the dwarf is not being killed.

#### The Dwarf Lord
The dwarf has the stats of a veteran. He carries an amulet that grants him a +1 bonus to his AC, along with 100 temporary hit points at the start of each day. He will take the Dodge action each turn unless the players ask him to do otherwise. If he is reduced to 0 hp, he makes death saving throws as a PC would.

#### Ratfolk Ninja Assassin
The assassin will leap out and use his Assassinate and Sneak Attack abilities to attempt to do as much damage to the dwarf as possible within the first round of combat. After one or two rounds of combat, if the dwarf and the players are still high on health and fighting strong, the assassin will call for a retreat. If the dwarf is low on health or making death saving throws, it will try to stick around long enough to finish the job before escaping. If the dwarf is higher on health, but the players aren't fairing well, it may switch tactics to bring down the players to leave the dwarf without defenders. However, if the assassin is being focused on by players and is reduced to 25% health or less, it will flee regardless of how well the fight is going.

#### Ratfolk Death Runners
The pair of death runners exist primarily to support the assassin in killing the dwarf. This may involve helping to deal extra damage to the dwarf if they get an opening. However, given that the players are likely to focus their attention on the assassin, the death runners may also attack and harass the players to interfere with their ability to protect the dwarf. If the assassin is slain or calls for a retreat, the death runners will flee unless it looks like they could feasibly kill the dwarf within one round.

### Aftermath
If the players manage to protect the dwarf, he will undoubtedly be grateful for their aid and likely task them with hunting down the rest of the ratfolk behind this assassination attempt. The reason the dwarf is being targeted could be part of a much larger web of intrigue that spans an entire adventure or campaign, or it could be a simple grudge a particular clan of ratfolk have against this dwarf. 

If the dwarf is slain, his kin may come to the players and ask them to exact vengeance on those responsible for the assassination. 

Within a minute of the attack, dwarf guards of the hold will appear and raise the gates. As it turns out, the guards keeping watch at this gate were quietly slain by the ratfolk, and their bodies were hidden out of sight while the ratfolk laid their trap.

\columnbreak

#### Loot
If the players protect the life of the dwarf lord, he will generously repay them in coin. How much he pays them is at your discretion, though 10,000gp worth of coins and gems would be reasonable. He may offer the players additional rewards if they track down those who arranged his attempted assassination.

#### XP Award: 15,000xp
The degree of success the players have in protecting the dwarf lord can effect their XP award. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.

* **Increase XP by 1/3:** The players slay all the ratfolk, and the dwarf never drops to 0 hit points.
* **Basline XP:** The assassin or both of the death runners escape, OR the dwarf drops to 0 hit points but doesn't die.
* **Decrease XP by 1/3:** The assassin or both of the death runners escape, AND the dwarf drops to 0 hit points but doesn't die.
* **Change XP to 1/3 of Baseline:** The dwarf is killed, but the players slay all the ratfolk.
* **Change XP to 1/10 of Baseline:** The dwarf is killed, and the assassin or both of the death runners escape.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Easier Encounter.** Replace the ratfolk death runners with ratfolk gutter runners, and dwarf's amulet gives him 50 temporary hit points rather than 100. Change the XP award to 9,000xp.

**Harder Encounter.** Replace the ratfolk ninja assassin with a ratfolk master assassin, the death runners with death runners of renown, and dwarf's amulet gives him 150 temporary hit points rather than 100. Change the XP award to 18,000xp.

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:

| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | The dwarf (or his family) puts a bounty on the head of the ratfolk chieftain who ordered the assassination. |
|  2  | The dwarf was on his way to this hold to try to broker a peace treaty between their clans. The assassination attempt has heightened tensions as it remains unclear who orchestrated it. |
|  3  | The assassination attempt was being made as part of a larger invasion being planned against the dwarf hold. |
|  4  | The ratfolk make another assassination attempt against the dwarf, this time with the aid of a demonic vermin lord deceiver. |




\pagebreakNum

> ##### Prisoner Transport Scenario
> If you want to change up the nature of this encounter to add more complicating factors, you can swap out the dwarven lord with an enemy commander or warchief of some kind. This NPC would use stats that are the same or at least of a similar CR, but instead of being an ally, it would be a prisoner of war the players are tasked with transporting to the dwarves alive. This prisoner would still prioritize dodging and surviving during the assassination attempt but may turn on the players if they see an opportunity to escape in the chaos of the assassination attempt.

## The Night Watch <br> (Player Levels: 7-9)
In this encounter, the players come across the body of a wizard recently murdered in his library by the deathmaster and soon become the ratfolk's next targets.



### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have been invited to stay the night at the abode of a notable scholarly wizard who has uncovered vital information stored in documents he wishes to entrust with the players so they can deliver it to the proper authorities. The night before the players are set to leave, the deathmaster infiltrates the wizard's home to assassinate him and destroy the information he has uncovered. Whether the players have been given the documents before this happens is up to you. Still, the deathmaster will consider anyone who has talked to the wizard a security risk and attempt to kill all the players regardless of whether they have the documents.

### Map Description
* **Heights.** The room's ceiling is 15 feet high. The stone statues in the room are 10 feet tall. The rest of the areas on the map highlighted in green extend up to the ceiling. 
* **Lighting.** There are torches throughout the room, but they have all been extinguished, leaving the library in total darkness.


<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>





* **Bookshelves (Yellow).** The bookshelves are 10 feet tall, have an AC 15, and have 30 HP. They can be knocked over using an action to make a DC 16 Strength check. If a bookshelf would be knocked over onto a creature, that creature succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity save or take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and get knocked prone as it is buried under the shelf and piles of heavy tomes. The creature or anyone within 5 feet of it can use an action to make a DC 16 Strength check to free the buried creature.
* **Cabinets (Orange).** The wooden cabinets have the same rules as the bookshelves, except ratfolk and Small creatures can hide inside them. Creatures inside of them have limited vision, and their line of sight extends out of the front in the area of a cone.

### Lead Up
While the players are resting, one of them receives a message from the *sending* spell coming from the wizard saying "in library. . . . . help. . . .". When the players arrive at the library, they will find all the lights out, and the wizard dead. If the deathmaster hears the players coming, he will hide before they arrive and attempt to eavesdrop on their conversation after they find the wizard. He will attack the players if:







<img src='https://i.ibb.co/rsQ9gtL/Library-Deathmaster-Guide.png' style='position:absolute; top:80px; right:40px; width:720px; ' />

\pagebreakNum

* One of them spots him.
* They try to leave the room.
* They start to cast spells.
* They appear to be making any type of combat preparation.
* They start lighting the torches around the room.
* They begin a thorough search of the room. 
* They are foolish enough to split up.
* It is clear they no longer have any more useful information to provide.

### Encounter Tactics
The tactics for the Deathmaster described in the Ninja Ratfolk Encounter Guide apply to this encounter and cover most of what you'd need to know. There are a few other points specific to this encounter you can consider

* The deathmaster can push over bookshelves to try and pin down players with low Strength and Dexterity.
* The bookshelves and cabinets are excellent for hiding and climbing.
* The deathmaster will put out torches the players light around the room whenever it has the chance so it can make better use of its cloak of shadows.
* The deathmaster isn't shy about retreating if it looks like the fight is going badly. It can always try to kill the players at a later time when they least suspect it.

### Aftermath
If the players manage to slay the deathmaster, they will be able to leave the following morning with the information they came here to collect. Though whoever sent the deathmaster may make further attempts to stop them. Depending on the rules you have for resurrection magic in your campaign, the players may even be able to resurrect the wizard.

If the deathmaster retreats, it will make further attempts to stop the players as they are transporting the documents. It may attack with a squad of other ninja ratfolk or try to find a more indirect way to sabotage the players. 

If the players are forced to retreat for their lives and manage to temporarily escape the deathmaster's reach, the deathmaster will dispose of the wizard's body and burn his abode to the ground. The deathmaster will then begin pursuing the players, potentially with other ninja ratfolk.
