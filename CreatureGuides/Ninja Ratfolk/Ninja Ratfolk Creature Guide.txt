# Ninja Ratfolk Creature Guide
This document contains a collection of resources to help you run adventures heavily featuring ratfolk. Ratfolk forces come in many shapes and sizes, but this guide will focus on ratfolk who utilize ninja-like abilities. These resources are divided into Encounter Guides, Loot Guides, and Example Encounters. Encounter Guides will help you understand the mindset, motivations, and tactics of the creatures, so you have a better idea of how to play them. Loot Guides provide alternate ways to provide treasure found after defeating these enemies. Example Encounters will provide encounter scenarios involving these creatures and instructions on how to run them.

## Encounter Guides
These guides explore the motivations and tactics of specific creatures to help provide richer roleplaying experiences when using them. Motivations determine the priorities the creature has and what goals it is likely to form based on them. Tactics determine the means through which the creature is most likely to achieve those goals. Motivations and tactics apply when roleplaying wild beasts looking for their next meal, as well as major characters serving as antagonists for an entire campaign.

### Motivations

Understanding a creature's motivations will help you give it goals that may put it into direct conflict with the players. If players can decern that a creature has goals that aren't just "be an enemy for the players to defeat," it will breathe more life into the world and give the players a chance to make more informed decisions as to how to deal with the creature. 

This section of the guide will provide examples of common motivations for these types of creatures in general and specialized motivations for more unique creatures.


### Tactics

Understanding a creature's preferred tactics will help you form a strategy for how the creature will attempt to achieve its goals and guide you in making the most of the creature's abilities. Players who can recognize a creature's tactics will then have a chance to make note of them and attempt to adjust their own tactics accordingly.

This section of the guide will provide examples of how the creatures prefer to initiate combat, what tactics they use during combat, and what they will do if they are losing.

## Loot Guides

The DMG contains Individual Treasure tables listing the number of coins that can be dropped by creatures of different CRs. However, many creatures have no reason to carry coins or even have them within their vicinity. Other creatures may carry wealth in the form of items whose value isn't apparent at first glance. 


And sometimes, items are hidden away in nearby areas that are difficult to spot. How different CRs are split among the tables also results in creatures of wildly different power levels dropping the same amounts of wealth.

You can use these loot guides if you wish to provide your players with alternate sources of wealth when they slay monsters that don't carry money, let players use their skills to collect wealth, or just provide treasure that scales more closely with creature CR.

The guides provide rules for allowing players to loot valuable goods from their foes' corpses or the surrounding area after an encounter. This looting can be done using a skill check made by one of the players, with the type of check required dependent on the type of item the player wishes to collect and how the item is being collected. The more successful the check, the more goods the player is able to collect. 

> ##### What’s Alternate Loot Good For?
>Treasure other than coins, gems, and art objects can be used to provide forms of wealth that better fit the context of the current environment. Players with the right skill sets might also be able to use valuables they find this way to craft useful items. These could be handy mundane items or even magic items. Hide and bone could be crafted into weapons and armor, while potent plants or liquids could form the base for a potion.

## Ninja Ratfolk Encounter Guide

The nature of ratfolk and the names they go by varies from setting to setting. However, adventures that pit players against evil ratfolk with ninja-like capabilities usually feature them as unscrupulous and underhanded adversaries who utilize speed, stealth, and agility to catch players off-guard and exploit their weaknesses. These ninja ratfolk dwell within secret lairs or hidden dispersed amongst larger populations where they can better remain hidden. 

Players may come into conflict with ninja ratfolk who are launching raids on other humanoids or performing sinister covert operations. Players may be called upon to foil a ninja clan’s attempts at assassination, theft, espionage, or sabotage. They may also be sent to hunt down ninja ratfolk or discover the whereabouts of their masters or the location of their clan’s lair.


### Ninja Ratfolk Motivations


Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk of the ninja clans see obtaining mastery of their deadly arts as the most reliable means of obtaining power and elevating their status. Mastery and status are obtained by carrying out missions on behalf of their clan or whoever is paying for their services. As such, most of their motivations will be tied to carrying out whatever task has been assigned to them. Individuals within the clan may have their own personal agendas, but should they be caught crossing the clan, they will be quickly eliminated.






#### Ninja Ratfolk Motivations
* Carrying out missions on behalf of their clan
* Seeking esoteric knowledge, training, or items to help further the mastery of their art
* Ascending through the ranks of their clan
* Finding formidable challenges to overcome, so as to prove their worth
* Acquiring secrets that can be leveraged for power

### Ninja Ratfolk Tactics
Ninja ratfolk utilize cunning, stealth, and ruthless opportunism to achieve their goals. These tactics apply to both grand strategic goals and moment-to-moment combat maneuvers. They are never obvious about their intentions or how they plan to achieve their ends, and these ratfolk almost always have a trick up their sleeve or some contingency plan to fall back on should they face challenging resistance.


#### Engagement

Ninja ratfolk never engage enemies on fair terms and will always look to strike when and where they are least expected. They usually avoid fights where they can’t dictate how the battle is started and almost always attempt to begin engagements with an ambush. Attacking players under cover of darkness is their preferred method. Still, they may also hide their agents amongst other ratfolk forces and only reveal themselves once the players have left one of their more vulnerable party members open to a sneak attack. 

Ratfolk ninjas also enjoy attacking players who are engaged with other foes, making it much easier to sneak up on unsuspecting party members. If the players manage to catch them on the back foot, most ratfolk ninjas will attempt to retreat and regroup for a surprise counterattack when the players are more vulnerable.


#### Combat

Ratfolk ninjas all make heavy use of hit-and-run tactics. They rarely stand toe-to-toe with formidable opponents and prefer to focus their attacks on players who are easy to hit and quick to bring down. Their high mobility and ability to disengage from fights make it hard for players to pin them down and easy for them to reach fragile players. 

Beyond these skirmishing strategies, ratfolk ninjas still make use of their standard racial abilities. They attack in groups whenever possible, enabling both their sneak attacks and their Overwhelming Mass ability. Scurry Away and Crevice Crawler also make retreat into tight spaces where players cannot follow all the easier.


#### Retreat
Ratfolk aren’t shy about retreating if a fight doesn’t appear to be going well. If ratfolk force as a whole is doing well, individual ratfolk will often fight to the death. However, their morale plummets once they no longer perceive themselves as having the upper hand. This may happen if the ratfolk lose more than half their fighting force or their leader is slain, and their enemies don’t appear to be near defeat. Under these circumstances, most ratfolk will flee if they have lost at least half their health, face a foe they don’t outnumber, or see multiple nearby allies flee.

#### Tactics: Night Runner

Night runners are the least trained and most expendable members of their clans. Though they prefer surprise attacks, they may also attack the players head-on if they see an opportunity, relying on speed and numbers rather than ambushes. They utilize most of the tactics common to other ninja ratfolk but are less sophisticated in their execution of these tactics and are more likely to lose their cool if the battle starts to go awry.

\pagebreak

#### Tactics: Death Runners 
Death runners utilize most of the same tactics as other ninja ratfolk, but due to the nature of their poisoned blades, they are incentivized to focus all their attacks on a single target. Squads of death runners should usually find low AC players and stack as many poisoned attacks against them as possible each round. 


#### Tactics: Triads of Duplicity
Invoke Duplicity can be used in several ways. It can be kept close to the triad, boosting the triad’s combat power, or moved around the battlefield to set up more elaborate ploys. These could include initiating combat with illusions to trick players into wasting spells on fake enemies while the real triads launch an ambush, using the illusions to facilitate a retreat, or using illusions to trick the players into thinking they’re outnumbered.

## Ratfolk Loot Guide
Because ratfolk are humanoids, most of the valuable goods that be looted from them are the remains of the equipment they were using or valuables they were carrying or hiding nearby. Most of the challenge of looting ratfolk is identifying what goods are truly valuable items, not just trinkets they were trying to pretend were impressive status symbols.

### Lootable Ratfolk Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but mystical objects may require different skills to identify, as described in the following table. If the player has proficiency in more than one skill that can be used for gathering the type of item they're looting, you can give them advantage on the check.

##### Ninja Ratfolk Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Coins or Other Obvious Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Ninja Sorcerer Items |  Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Religion |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. As ratfolk are quick to horde anything they might see as valuable, the difficulty in looting ratfolk often stems from sorting out actual valuables from items that have simply been made to appear valuable. 

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, a Monstrous Bone may be worth 10gp, but a Pristine Monstrous Bone would be worth 20gp, and a Cracked Monstrous Bone would be worth 5gp. Gems may be flawed, hide might be tattered, and metal corroded, cutting their value in half, and any item in pristine condition can be worth twice as much. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort.


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Bone | Gem | Hide | Metal |Liquid |
|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|  1gp |  Rat Bone |  Green Quartz  | Leather Scraps | Blade Fragment | Vial of Toxins |
|  10gp| Trophy Skull |  Warp Stone  | Armored Leather | Intact Blade | Vial of Poisons |
|  100gp| Etched Skull |  Warp Gem  | Runed Leather | Warp-Steel Fragment | Vial of Warp-Venom |
