# Demons of Decay Creature Guide
This document contains a collection of resources to help you run adventures featuring demons of rot and pestilence. These resources are divided into Encounter Guides, Loot Guides, and Example Encounters. Encounter Guides will help you understand the mindset, motivations, and tactics of the creatures, so you have a better idea of how to play them. Loot Guides provide alternate ways to provide treasure found after defeating these enemies. Example Encounters will provide encounter scenarios involving these creatures and instructions on how to run them.

## Encounter Guides
These guides explore the motivations and tactics of specific creatures to help provide richer roleplaying experiences when using them. Motivations determine the priorities the creature has and what goals it is likely to form based on them. Tactics determine the means through which the creature is most likely to achieve those goals. Motivations and tactics apply when roleplaying wild beasts looking for their next meal, as well as major characters serving as antagonists for an entire campaign.

### Motivations

Understanding a creature's motivations will help you give it goals that may put it into direct conflict with the players. If players can decern that a creature has goals that aren't just "be an enemy for the players to defeat," it will breathe more life into the world and give the players a chance to make more informed decisions as to how to deal with the creature. 

This section of the guide will provide examples of common motivations for these types of creatures in general and specialized motivations for more unique creatures.

\columnbreak

### Tactics

Understanding a creature's preferred tactics will help you form a strategy for how the creature will attempt to achieve its goals and guide you in making the most of the creature's abilities. Players who can recognize a creature's tactics will then have a chance to make note of them and attempt to adjust their own tactics accordingly.

This section of the guide will provide examples of how the creatures prefer to initiate combat, what tactics they use during combat, and what they will do if they are losing.

## Loot Guides

The DMG contains Individual Treasure tables listing the number of coins that can be dropped by creatures of different CRs. However, many creatures have no reason to carry coins or even have them within their vicinity. Other creatures may carry wealth in the form of items whose value isn't apparent at first glance. 


And sometimes, items are hidden away in nearby areas that are difficult to spot. How different CRs are split among the tables also results in creatures of wildly different power levels dropping the same amounts of wealth.

You can use these loot guides if you wish to provide your players with alternate sources of wealth when they slay monsters that don't carry money, let players use their skills to collect wealth, or just provide treasure that scales more closely with creature CR.

The guides provide rules for allowing players to loot valuable goods from their foes' corpses or the surrounding area after an encounter. This looting can be done using a skill check made by one of the players, with the type of check required dependent on the type of item the player wishes to collect and how the item is being collected. The more successful the check, the more goods the player is able to collect. 

> ##### What’s Alternate Loot Good For?
>Treasure other than coins, gems, and art objects can be used to provide forms of wealth that better fit the context of the current environment. Players with the right skill sets might also be able to use valuables they find this way to craft useful items. These could be handy mundane items or even magic items. Hide and bone could be crafted into weapons and armor, while potent plants or liquids could form the base for a potion.

## Demons of Decay Encounter Guide

These demons represent the existential terror that comes from knowing all things will eventually succumb to entropy and rot away. They are drawn to people and places where that decay is most apparent and revel in the tendency of mortals to neglect themselves and the world they live in, thus allowing disease and entropy to run their course unopposed. Mortals who wish to overcome the hardships of disease and decay may make pacts with these demons, forfeiting their souls for greater physical and mental resilience. 

Players are most likely to encounter these demons when they’ve been summoned by such mortals. But demons of decay may also spawn in locations that have allowed neglect and entropy to run rampant. A moldering town, a neglected sewer, or a disease-ridden city are all places where demons of decay may manifest themselves and begin spreading their plagues.



### Demon of Decay Motivations

In contrast to their grizzly appearance and nihilistic associations, demons of decay have cheery dispositions. They see the inevitable deterioration of all things as something to be celebrated, and they seek to hasten this process wherever they go. Death and decay are natural parts of the cycle of life and rebirth, and they promote this cycle by rotting away mortals and using their corpses to birth foul demons.  

It is equally important to demons of decay that they spread life wherever they go. This life just happens to be in the form of virulent diseases and parasites. To demons of decay, it is an honor to carry such life, and they are eager to impart their “gifts” to as many mortals as possible.

When role-playing demons of decay, you can have them behave in a jovial and benevolent manner. When they spread diseases, they believe they are altruistically promoting life and passing blessings onto the infected. When they inflict rot and decay on objects and creatures, they see themselves as bringing beauty into the world. There is a playfulness to their work, and demons of decay are always ready to celebrate rot and ruin being brought into the world.


#### Common Demon of Decay Motivations
* Bring about ruin through decay
* Spread different types of diseases
* Celebrate with other demons of decay
* Collect components used to brew new plagues
* Eliminate any who specialize in healing or curing diseases
* Persuade mortals to worship demon lords of decay


\columnbreak

### Demon of Decay Tactics
These fiends share many similar characteristics that lead to certain fighting styles. 

***Resilience.*** Demons of decay usually have low AC but high amounts of health. They also often have regenerative abilities that they can pass on to each other. These traits lead to them being accustomed to taking a lot of hits. 

***Melee Oritanted.*** Demons of decay usually have better melee options than ranged options. There are exceptions to this, but it is usually in their best interest close in on foes from all sides and keep players locked up in melee combat.

***Limited Mobility Options.*** Demons of decay have access to multiple steeds, but as far as mounts go, none of them are particularly fast. Demons of decay usually want to find ways to bog players down so they can avoid being out-maneuvered, especially since they do best when they can close into melee range.

***Debuffs & Damage Over Time Effects.*** Demons of decay usually don’t do outrageous amounts of damage all at once. Instead, they prefer to infect players with effects that whittle them down over time. They also leave hazardous terrain across the battlefield, which does damage over time and helps tip maneuverability options in their favor.



#### Engagement

Because of their poor stealth, most demons of decay won’t be able to surprise the players. And their reliance on melee attacks means the fight will often start with them shambling toward the players as quickly as possible and bogging them down in close combat. Demons of decay usually perform better when grouped up, so they will try to converge on their targets into a massed group, coming from multiple angles when possible.


#### Combat

Demons of decay show little concern for their well-being and will risk taking heavy damage if it means they can subject the players to their attacks and abilities. Because they often use abilities that deal damage over time, demons of decay try to “spread the love” to as many players as possible to maximize these abilities. Players that can cure or mitigate the putrid abilities of these demons quickly earn their ire and become the highest priority targets.

#### Retreat
Demons of decay never retreat out of fear for their existence, even when on their home plane where death would be permanent. They see their end as simply part of the natural way of things. They usually only flee a battle to get reinforcements, find more appealing victims, or lure pursuers into a more exposed position for a counterattack.


\pagebreakNum


#### Tactics: Plague Bearers of Decay

The rank-and-file of these demons have straightforward tactics. They simply want to surround players en masse so they will be overwhelmed by their demonic stench and then use their melee attacks to infect as many players as possible. Grouping up is generally to their advantage as it empowers their Fetid Stench ability. 

While staying together in a loose group, plague bearer will distribute their attacks amongst players to attempt to infect as many of them as possible. Plague bearers can sense when a player has been successfully infected, and they focus their attacks on the uninfected. Once all players are infected, they will usually prioritize whichever players have been overcome by their Fetid Stench.

As with all demons of decay, plague bearers will make slaying healers their priority, especially anyone curing diseases.

If a plague bearer has death heads at its disposal, it will hang back and bombard non-infected players from afar until it runs out of ammo and needs to close into melee.

##### Exalted Plague Bearers
These elite demons generally use the same tactics as their lesser kin. Their ranged attacks give them greater flexibility in who they can target, and they may opt to stay out of melee range of players if approaching is difficult or there are players well out of melee reach they want to attempt to infect.

##### Festering Stooges 

These strange demons will attempt to position themselves to subject as many players as possible to the effect of their Gloom of Flies. If the players are all spread out, they will go after the player with the fewest escape options. If a stooge is near death, it will try to position itself in a way that the cloud of flies it leaves behind will be difficult or inconvenient for players to avoid.

##### Plague-Ridden and Heralds of Decay
These demons act as leaders to other demons of decay and will wade into the thick of combat where they can put their locus ability to best use. Using locus traits to their maximum potential means ideally being near several infected players and other demons of decay at the same time. 

They possess several spells they can use to turn the tide of battle in their favor.


***Plague-Ridden Spells.***

***Cloudkill.*** This is a perfect opening spell that can be used to force ranged players out of advantageous positions and closer into melee range. If the plague-ridden can hit two or more players with this spell before they’ve moved into melee range, they will.

***Inflict Rot.*** This spell is ideal when the players are grouped together and tied up in melee combat. The plague-ridden will target the player that appears to have the lowest constitution, avoiding fighters and barbarians. 

***Blight.*** This is usually the last spell the plague-ridden will cast, and it will prioritize players infected with Abyssal Rot or under the effects of the Inflict Rot spell in an attempt to quickly subdue them.

\columnbreak

***Herald of Decay Spells.***

***Circle of Death.*** The herald will cast this spell as soon as it can hit three or more players with it. Since demons of decay are immune to necrotic damage, it doesn’t have to worry about them being within the spell’s area.

***Harm.*** This is a good opening spell when the herald hasn’t yet gotten into melee range. The herald is good at intuiting the saving throw capabilities of players and will target someone it doesn’t think is likely to pass the save.

***Regenerate.*** The herald will usually cast this on itself if it is below half health and supporting multiple minions with its locus ability. If there is another particularly powerful demon it is fighting alongside, it may opt to target that demon to keep it in the fight longer.

#### Tactics: Plague Toads
These fiends are dimwitted predators that rely more on instinct than learned tactics. They have various combat options, but if plague toads aren’t commanded by more intelligent creatures, their default goal will be to gulp down the easiest-to-swallow humanoid in sight and hop away so its new meal can be properly digested. 

Plague toads prefer to hunt in bogs or other toxic environments filled with water and difficult terrain that they can easily navigate through hopping and swimming. They may try to sneak up on prey, but their mobility lets them easily catch up to most quarry in these environments even if they are spotted.

A plague toad has four types of attacks, and will choose the one that best fits its circumstances.

**Bite.** The toad will use this attack if it is in melee range and wants to attempt to grapple and escape with a player in tow. This is not an ideal action since it should try to get a bite in as part of its Leap Attack or Togue action.

**Gore.** The toad will generally only use this as part of its Leap Attack feature. Its Leap Attack is how it prefers to engage players in combat, and it may even provoke opportunity attacks if it means leaping into more favorable terrain or landing a Leap Attack against a more vulnerable player.

**Swallow.** The toad will almost always attempt to swallow a creature it has grappled. Once it’s done so, it will start using Dash actions to flee the battle.

**Tongue.** The toad will use this attack to hit players it can’t quite reach with its other attacks. It may also rely on its tongue to avoid leaping into unfavorable terrain or being surrounded.

##### Plague Toads as Steeds
Plague toads being used as steeds by plague bearers will use more sophisticated tactics, using tongue and bite attacks to grapple and pull players into unfavorable terrain. Separating players in this way also makes it harder for them to free anyone who has been swallowed. 

##### Bog Barons
These toads use mostly the same tactics, except they are more willing to leap into the middle of players to subject multiple targets to their Miasma of Rot ability. They can sense which players are suffering from their Wasting Sickness and will focus their attacks on them.



\pagebreakNum

#### Tactics: Plaguelings
Plaguelings are primarily focused on making mischief. A lone plagueling will never attack the players. Instead, it will most likely stalk them until they make camp. At that point, it will perform acts of mischief such as eating their rations, spreading disease-ridden filth across their belongings, or even biting a sleeping player to infect them with disease.

A plagueling acting in service to another creature can be quite helpful in combat despite having little fighting ability. Plaguelings can use their Noxious Cradle ability to hide within their master and pop out at a moment's notice to use the Help action. They may also attempt to sneak up on players and make a bite attack from hiding to gain advantage on the attack and potentially infect their target.

##### Plagueling Swarms.
Swarms enjoy hiding within other creatures and pop out at a moment's notice to overwhelm players who've been caught off guard. A few seemingly outnumbered plague bringers can suddenly unleash waves of plaguelings to aid them in battle.

Plagueling swarms can also act as surprise mounts. If a plague bringer carrying them needs to close a distance quickly, the swarm can pop out, pick up the plague bringer, and move 75 feet, all in the same turn. Plague bringers can use this to close in on players quickly and potentially even reach squishier players who thought they were a safe distance away. Once the plague bearer reaches its desired target, the plagueling swarm will generally wander off and start harassing players by attacking and attaching to them.

##### Plagueling Tides.
These massive swarms function in much the same way as smaller swarms. The key difference is that they can grapple multiple creatures, so they will be incentivized to grab hold of as many players as possible once they make their entrance.

\columnbreak

#### Tactics: Beast of Decay
Plague beasts behave playfully and don’t even realize they’re in combat. To them, they’re just bounding up and greeting new friends. Most other demons commanding them won’t attempt to curb their nature. As such, plague beasts should be played more randomly and chaotically rather than tactically. They will rush headlong toward the first player they see using their Attention Seeker feature. If they reach their target with extra movement left, they can begin circling the player like an excited dog, leaving a slime trail around their new friend. It will then start making use of its Erratic Attacks.

The beast will hyper-focus on one player at a time and may randomly decide to sprint after another target when its focus shifts. You can represent this by rolling a d4 at the start of each of its turns and, on a result of 4, having the beast direct its attention to the next nearest player.

#### Tactics: Rot Flies

Rot flies exist to inflict pain on mortals. When acting of their own accord, they will prioritize attacking the closest mortal creature they can see unless they are aware of the presence of a creature who has killed them before. In this case, their highest priority will be hunting down that creature.

The rot fly has multiple attack options and will use different attacks under different circumstances.

**Stinger.** This is the rot fly's preferred opening attack. If a player poisoned by the stinger manages to save against it on a later turn, the rot fly will usually try to reapply the poison. It will not waste its time trying to poison creatures that appear to have high Constituion.

**Blade Legs.** The rot fly will use blade leg attacks against creatures it fails to poison with its stinger or gain advantage on attacks against. If the creature it's fighting looks like it has low Strength, it may replace one of its multi-attacks with a shove to knock its victim prone to gain advantage on the second attack.

**Proboscis.** The rot fly will use this against creatures it has advantage on attacks against.
If the rot fly is being ridden by plague bearers, the plague bearers will direct it toward backline players, such as spell casters. The plague bearers will use their actions to help give the rot fly advantage on its attacks against its victim so it can use its proboscis attack to attach to its target. The plague bearer can do this through Help actions and shove attacks to knock creatures prone if they appear to have low Strength.

#### Tactics: Unclean Ones

These monsters act as leaders and elite demons among their kind. They have very high mental stats, making them master tacticians who know exactly which players will be weakest against their diseases and who will be able to cure said diseases and thus need to be slain first.

Though unclean ones have many combat options, their priority will almost always be to get into melee range of players as quickly as possible to begin whittling away their vitality. Mountain of Loathsome flesh is good for closing distance this way. If the unclean one can’t get into melee range, it will start using noxious bile attacks or cast horrid wilting if the players are grouped up. 

Once it is in melee range, the unclean one will hit as many players as possible with its bilesword to create as many infections as it can. It will then start infecting players with *rancid visitations*. The unclean will start with players with the lowest chance of succeeding on Constitution saving throws. If there’s someone actively removing diseases, the unclean one will focus on that player with its bilesword attacks. 

By default, unclean ones will use their Blubber and Bile reaction whenever they take 50 or more damage from a single attack. If they know a player can deal massive radiant or fire damage, such as a paladin with smite attacks, they will usually save Blubber and Bile for these attacks.

Unclean ones have the following spells they can use once per day:

***Cloudkill.*** Use this to block ranged attackers proving problematic. It can also be used against grouped-up players if *horrid wilting* is no longer available. 

***Dispel Magic.*** Use this to remove any spell that is hampering the unclean one’s action economy.

***Finger of Death.*** Use this to finish off any creature outside of melee range and near death. Creatures infected with Abyssal Rot are also perfect targets if the unclean one thinks it can kill them outright.

***Heal.*** Use this to cure the unclean one of the blinded condition, or if it looks like it can defeat the players through a battle of attrition and it needs some extra hit points to make it the rest of the way. Consider using it once the unclean one is missing 90 or more hit points.

&emsp;***Horrid Wilting.*** This spell can be a good opening attack if the unclean one can’t get into melee range and several players are grouped up. Otherwise, it will wait to use it until it can hit two players infected with Abyssal Rot or at least four players altogether. 

***Locate Creature.*** The unclean one will use this to find lovely new specimens outside combat.

##### Exalted Unclean Ones
These greater demons use most of the same tactics as their lesser kind. The primary difference is in the use of their Virulent Contagion and Pestilent Decay legendary actions. Virulent Contagion should be used to accelerate the rate at which the unclean one spreads diseases. Pestilent Decay should be used whenever three or more players are infected with diseases or one player is suffering the full effects of the *contagion* spell. If there’s a player curing diseases, Virulent Contagion can be used to target players far away from the healer, making curing diseases as difficult as possible.

\columnbreak

##### Uncle Cruncle
This strange unclean one varies slightly from other unclean ones in his combat tactics. He tries to move around the battlefield, spreading his Defiling Deluge while infecting as many players with Uncle’s Bloat as possible. Once the majority of players are infected, he will primarily use *spirit leech* to help him outlast the players and focus his attacks on any players limiting his mobility or preventing him from healing.

**Gut Check.** Cruncle will use this legendary action whenever he can potentially push a player through at least two 5-foot squares affected by his Defilling Deluge. He can also use this to position players affected by Uncle’s Bloat next to other players so he can hit more targets with his Spew Poo Party legendary action.

**Spew Poo Party.** This is an ideal legendary action to use on Cruncle whenever he’s in an area unaffected by Defiling Deluge. He can also target players infected with Uncle’s Bloat whenever they’re in unaffected areas.

#### Tactics: The Plaguefather
The Plaguefather’s primary goal is to experiment with his diseases. As such, his priority is to infect as many players at any one time as possible. He isn’t concerned with trying to kill anyone as quickly as possible unless they are destroying his experiments or have a natural resistance to disease, in which case they break through his scientific detachment and drive him to try and slay them as quickly as possible.

The Plaguefather’s tactics are the polar opposite of most unclean ones. Rather than jumping into the fray, he will try to stay as far from the players as possible while keeping them in line of sight. Here, he will bombard them with his necrotic missiles. He will usually be riding a plagueling tide which he uses as a controlled mount. He will stay on this mount whenever possible and have it take Dash and Disengage actions to keep him out of melee reach of his foes. The slime trail he leaves behind as he moves makes pursuit that much more difficult. 

Below are some of his key abilities and how he is most likely to use them.

**Infestation.** He will prioritize using this ability to heal the swarm carrying him. If it doesn’t need to be healed, he will create a new swarm to send after the players to bog them down.

**Swarm Surge.** This ability will be used on his mount to remove him from melee combat. He may also use it on a plagueling tide grappling players to move them into an unfavorable position.

**Summon Plaguelings.** He will use this ability if he is not in immediate danger, and will usually prioritize players who fit the following criteria. 
* The creature is of a race or class with a natural resistance to disease (such as a dwarf or paladin.)
* The creature already has a plagueling swarm or tide in its space.
* The creature is curing diseases.
* The creature is close enough to present a melee threat.

## Demons of Decay Loot Guide
The bodies of most demons dissolve or fade away when they're slain anywhere but their home plane. However, you may have these demons leave behind traces of themselves to be harvested by players. These items could be fragments of the demons that didn’t dissolve or the players managed to prevent from fading away into the aether. 

### Lootable Demon of Decay Items

If you want slain demons to drop fragments of themselves rather than fade away completely, you can roll to determine what was dropped randomly. 

You could also make this an active process where the players attempt to gather items by preventing parts of the demon from dissolving or even attempting to reform them from the residual aether the demon left behind. In this case, have the harvesting player make a skill check. 

If you don’t want the demons to leave anything behind, you can instead have the players search the area where the demons were slain to see if they find any valuables formed the corrupting presence of the fiends.


##### Demon of Decay Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Corrupted Items in the Surrounding Area  | Intelligence (Arcana), or Wisdom (Survival) | 
|  Items Harvested from the Demon’s Fading Form |  Intelligence (Arcana) or Wisdom (Religion) |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. The difficulty in looting may be detecting corrupted items nearby or using otherworldly knowledge to attempt to preserve some physical remains of the demon.

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, Demon Bile may be worth 10gp, but a Thick Demon Bile would be worth 20gp, and a Diluted Demon Bile would be worth 5gp. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort. 

In the case of items dropped by demons of decay, qualities that would normally mark an item it inferior often make it more valuable. For example, if items are especially rotted, that usually signifies that they were infused with even more demonic corruption, making them more valuable rather than less.

\columnbreak 

##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Bone | Fluid | Flesh  | Hide | Plant |
|:---:|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1gp | Bone of Decay | Tainted Water |  Flesh of Decay  |  Skin of Decay | Tainted Plant |
|  10gp| Disease-Infused Bone| Demon Bile |  Disease-Infused Flesh |  Disease-Cured Skin | Diseased-Infused Plant |
|  100gp| Infested Bone | Demon-Bowel Sludge  |  Infested Flesh  |  Infested Hide | Abyssal Fungus |
|  1,000gp| Rot-Blessed Bone |  Demon Lord Offal |  Rot-Blessed Flesh   | Rot-Blessed Hide | Rot-Blessed Fungus |
|  10,000gp| Rotting God Bone |  Divine Excrement |  Decaying God Flesh   | Rotting God Skin | Divine Fungal Growth |
|  100,000gp| Plague- father's Skull |  Plague- father's Brew|  Plague- father's Heart| Plague- father's Cowl| Plague- father's Prize Deathcap|

### Loot Tables
The following tables describe the number of items and value of those items the players are able to loot depending on the result of their check. You can have them make a separate check for each creature they're looting or use one check for multiple creatures at once to save time.

# Example Demons of Decay Encounters

## The Bog Riders <br> (Player Level: 9-11)
In this encounter, the players find themselves traveling through a blighted swamp where they attract the attention of a trio of plague toads, each being ridden by a plague bearer.

### Encounter Context
The encounter assumes the players are traveling through a bog currently home to demons of decay. The players may be aware of the demonic presence in the swamp, or they may be blissfully unaware and simply trying to pass to the other side. 

### Lead Up
This encounter begins with the players making their way through a fetid swamp. They will notice the bog riders just before they hop into the locations shown on the map. Because the bog riders will move in as quickly as possible rather than using stealth, none of the player characters should be surprised. The players should start the encounter roughly in the center of the map.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** This depends on the time of day, but the bog riders will most likely attack at dusk or night when there is low light or total darkness.
* **Bog Rider Starting Areas (TR).** The bog riders should start the encounter at roughly these locations.
* **Water’s Edge (Light Green Border).** These lines represent the threshold between land that can be walked on and water deep enough to require characters to swim.
* **Swamp Debris (Orange Border).** This area is difficult terrain.
* **Reeds (Purple Border).** This area is difficult terrain, and creatures within it are lightly obscured.  The reeds also provide half-cover against ranged attacks.
* **Rotting Trees (Red Border.** These trees provide total cover and can be climbed with a successful DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check.



### The Battle
The plague bearers and plague toad steeds fight using the tactics described in the Demons of Decay Encounter Guide. They will use the swampy terrain to their advantage and attempt to outmaneuver the players, separating and picking them off.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



### Aftermath
The attacking demons have no sense of self-preservation; their only goal is to slay all the players. A toad controlled by a plague bearer will only flee if it has swallowed a player and wants to separate that character from the rest of the group. Otherwise, the plague bearers and the toads under their control will fight to the death. Plague toads that lose their rider will become interested in escaping with the easiest meal possible. If the players flee, the demons will pursue them until they escape the swamp. 

#### Loot
As a stand-alone fight in the wilderness, this encounter doesn't need to yield loot beyond what the players can get by harvesting items using the guidelines in the Demons of Decay Loot Guide. If you wish to provide additional treasure, you can have each toad carry 1d6 x 100 GP in its belly from previously devoured travelers.

#### XP Award: 8,500xp
The degree of success the players have in defeating the demons can affect their XP reward. You can use the following potential outcomes as guidelines to modify how much XP you award your players.
 
* **150% XP:** The players defeat all the demons using excellent tactics that prevent them from wasting resources.
* **100% XP:** The players defeat all the demons, but with some amount of struggle.
* **50% XP:** The players defeat at least half the demons, but then flee.
* **10% XP:** The players flee after defeating less than half the demons.

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.
 
**Easier Encounter (Levels 6-8).** The players are attacked by plague toads without any riders. Change the XP award to 6,000xp.
 
**Harder Encounter (Levels 12-14).** Replace the plague toads with bog barons.  Change the XP award to 10,000xp, and double the gold carried by the toads.

## The Rot Nest <br> (Player Levels: 12-14)

##### Encounter Map: Rot Nest

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


In this encounter, the players venture into a giant underground nest to exterminate the rot flies lurking there.


### Encounter Context
This encounter doesn’t require any setup beyond the players entering the nest. They may have found it in the wild or have been hired as otherworldly exterminators to clear the nest.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** It is pitch black inside the nest. <br>
* **The Nest Walls (Green).** The ceiling of the nest is 25 feet high, and there are several columns stretching from the floor to the ceiling.  The columns and walls can be climbed with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Rot Fly (W).**

### Lead Up
When the players arrive in the nest, they will see a rot fly in each of the starting locations on the map. Each rot fly has a plague bearer atop its back. Due to the sentient nature of the nest, it is impossible to sneak in undetected. Soon as the players enter in from the tunnel, the demons will be alerted to their presence and attack.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>




### The Nest

While there are demons of decay within the nest, it is a quasi-sentient entity hostile to intruders. The nest is aware of all creatures within it and knows their exact locations. 

#### Lair Action
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the nest takes a lair action to cause the following effect:

* Ooze bubbles up from up to 16 5-foot-by-5-foot square surfaces within the nest. Each pool must be contiguous with at least one other pool. Areas covered in the ooze are rough terrain.<br>
On initiative count 20 of the next turn, the ooze pools created on the previous turn explode and disappear. Each creature occupying a space with exploding ooze is covered in slime. While covered in slime, a creature moves at half speed, has disadvantage on Constitution saving throws, and all attack rolls against it have advantage. <bR>
A creature can use its action to attempt to scrape the slime off itself or another creature by making a DC 15 Strength check, removing the slime on a success.



<img src='https://i.ibb.co/pWGDCGp/Wasp-Nest-Guid.png' style='position:absolute; top:132px; right:125px; width:590px; ' />


\pagebreakNum

> ##### Quickly Oozing Up The Map
> In order to lay down the ooze more quickly each turn, it may be best to break it into 4 sections of 4 5-foot squares of ooze that you can place throughout the nest each time.

### The Battle
The rot flies and plague bearers fight using the tactics described in the *Demons of Decay Encounter Guide*. They will use the confined terrain and ooze puddles to their advantage cornering and attacking players covered in slime. The slime is especially useful for the rot flies as it enables their proboscis attacks. 

The nest has limited intelligence and won’t be able to tactically target players less likely to escape the ooze.

### Aftermath
The demons will fight to the death to protect their nest. If the players flee, the remaining demons will stay to guard their nest and recuperate any losses. 

If the players slay all the demons, the nest will cease its lair actions, and the players will have the opportunity to destroy it. Setting it on fire or causing a cave-in are the most efficient ways to destroy it, but the players may come up with novel methods of their own.

#### Loot
There are the corpses of previous adventurers embedded into the walls. If a player makes a Wisdom (Perception) check to spend 10 minutes searching the nest, they will find a number of bodies equal to the result divided by 5 (rounded) up. A maximum of 6 bodies can be found this way. Each body carries 2d12 x 100 gp worth of coins and valuables.

**Easier Encounter (Levels 9-11).** The players are attacked by rot flies without any riders. Change the XP award to 8,500xp, and reduce the gp value of loot found on each body by half.

**Harder Encounter (Levels 15-17).** Replace the plague bearers with exalted plague bearers. Change the XP award to 20,000xp, and double the gp value of the loot found on each body.

|  2  | The bulk of the rot flies isn’t at the nest because they’re currently making their way to the nearest town to wreak havoc.|
|  3  | When the players exit the nest, they find themselves on the demonic home plane of the rot flies. |
|  4  | This was a minor outlying nest. The main nest is much larger and home to the source of the rot flies.|

## Plague Top Carnival <br> (Player Level: 19)
In this encounter, the players find themselves caught in a pestilent circus show where they must contend with a parading stream of demons of decay.

### Encounter Context
The players are in a town where a dilapidated circus tent has mysteriously appeared on a nearby hill. Since its appearance, sickness has spread through the town, crops have withered, and many buildings have rapidly decayed. Many have gone to investigate the tent, but none have returned. 



### Lead Up
The tent is a putrid green color with stripes of sickening yellow. Molds and other fungi cover its surface, and droning carnival music can be heard from within. Any attempt to damage or cut through the tent will fail as it immediately regenerates itself, and all attempts to teleport through it fail. 

There is only one entrance into the tent, and a fat, bloated man in ragged overalls stands before it (use the stat block for a noble if needed). The man refers to himself as “the announcer,” and if he is questioned about the tent or what he is doing here, he will say they are a traveling entertainment troupe. And if he’s questioned about their effect on the town, he will respond that it is merely their way of extending an invitation to join the festivities. He tells the players that if the town’s residents really wish for them to depart, all they have to do is stay through the whole show and request that the traveling troupe leave afterward.

If the players kill the announcer, he will be instantly revived within the tent.

When the players enter the tent, they come through the upper gateway of the encounter map. As they enter the arena, they will see the upper balconies of the tent are filled with hollering and cheering disease-ridden creatures. The announcer will appear in the upper balconies and announce the arrival of the players: “Our ceaseless show lingers on with fresh participants. Let us share with them all the joys this festival can bestow!”


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The arena is dimly lit.
* **The Tent.** The tent is 40 feet high and impossible to damage, as described in the Lead Up.
* **Player Entrance.** The 40-foot-high doorway the players came through is to the top left of the map, but the players cannot pass through it during the encounter.
* **The Arena (Large Red Circle).** Any attempts to move or teleport out of this area fail and the creature attempting to do so takes 3d10 necrotic damage as a result. Attacks and spell effects that extend outside of this area are nullified. 
* **Columns (Small Red Circles).** These columns reach the top of the tent and can be climbed with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check.
* **Encounter Entrances (Yellow).** The foes the players will face will pass through these massive entrances, but the players are unable to cross them.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

### The Show

This encounter consists of three staggered waves of demons that pour into the arena and attack the players. The first wave starts right after the players enter the arena and the announcer makes his opening remarks. After that, each subsequent wave comes 4 rounds (16 seconds) after the previous one entered the arena. 

Lingering effects from previous waves, such as the slime trails of beasts of decay, carry over from one fight to the next. 
The creatures can enter through any of the doorways of your choice.

#### 1st Wave
The announcer shouts the following: <br>
*"Let us set this verdant stage with our first performance: the festering brothers and their adorably dripping companions!"*

##### The creatures:
* 3 Beasts of Decay
* 2 Festering Stooges

#### 2nd Wave
The announcer shouts the following: <br>
*"Though our opening act has passed, this simply primed us for our next spectacle. Please welcome our putrid jugglers and their pungent little lads!"*

##### The creatures:
* 2 Plague Bearer, Festering Stooges
* 1 Plague Bearer, Herald of Decay
* 3 Plagueling Swarms (Each can be inside one of the plague bearers)

\pagebreakNum


#### 3rd Wave

The announcer shouts the following: <br>
*"It seems our mortal guests have not welcomed the joys of our carnival into their hearts. No matter! The final symptoms of our celebration are manifesting in a grand finale. And what greater finale could there be than the great putrid uncle himself!"*

##### The creatures:
* 1 Exalted Unclean One

### Aftermath
Once the unclean one is slain, the entire tent, the audience, and the announcer will all begin decomposing into mulch around the players. 

You can award the players 35,000xp for successfully completing the encounter.

You can also place part of a treasure hoard, including magic items, among the remains of the tent. 1d4 items worth 10,000 gp each found among the mulch would be a good reward, and you can use the example items from the Demons of Decay Loot Guide as inspiration for item descriptions. 

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.
 
**Easier Encounter (Level 17).** <br>
Change the demon waves to the following:
##### 1st Wave:
* 2 Plague Bearer, Festering Stooges
* 2 Beasts of Decay

##### 2nd Wave:
* 2 Plague Bearers
* 1 Plague Bearer, Plague-Ridden
* 3 Plagueling Swarms (Each can be inside one of the plague bearers)

##### 3rd Wave:
* 1 Great Unclean One

**Harder Encounter (Level 20).** Change the demon waves to the following:

##### 1st Wave:
* 3 Plague Bearer, Festering Stooges
* 3 Beasts of Decay

##### 2nd Wave:
* 2 Plague Bearer, Festering Stooges
* 1 Plague Bearer, Herald of Decay
* 3 Plagueling Tides

## The Plaguefather <br> (Player Level: 20)
In this encounter, the players discover the chamber of the legendary Plaguefather, where he is brewing his next batch of virulent plagues to unleash upon the world.

### Encounter Context
This encounter has the potential to be the final battle of an adventure, if not an entire campaign. The Adventure Followups table on the next page has ideas for how to fit it into a larger adventure. However this encounter is brought into your adventures, it shouldn’t be taken lightly, and the players should have some idea of what they’re up against rather than stumbling blindly to their deaths. 

### Lead Up
How the players find this chamber will depend on the context of the encounter. They should know what awaits them inside, though there will be no other way to enter except through the main entrance, at which point, The Plaguefather will be aware of their presence. 


### Map Description
* **Lighting.** The chamber is dimly lit with a sickly greenish light.
* **Walls (Green).** The hallway walls are 30 ft. high, and the main chamber walls are 50 ft. high. They all prevent any form of teleportation into or out of the chamber as though it is under the effects of the *forbiddance* spell.
* **Entrance (Purple).** A 9th-level *alarm* spell is placed at the entrance, alerting the plaguefather to the presence of intruders.
* **Plague Moat (Red).** This area is filled with 50-foot-deep contaminated water, and there is a 5-foot drop from down into the water. A creature that starts its turn in the water or enters it for the first time on a turn must make a DC 22 Consitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 6d8 Necrotic damage. On a success, it takes half as much damage.  
* **Brewing Platform (Light Blue Circle).** This elevated area is reached by its stairs to the south and is 20 feet above the rest of the chamber.
* **Plague Cauldron (Dark Blue Circle).** The cauldron where The Plaguefather works stands 15 feet tall. Any creature that falls within it suffers the same effects as falling into the Plague Moat, except the creature also becomes infected with an experimental disease (see The Plaguefather stat block) on a failed save. 
* **Plagueling Swarm (S).** These plagueling swarms are treated as though they’ve been summoned by the Plaguefather’s Infestation ability. 
* **The Plaguefather (PF).** The Plaguefather sits atop a plagueling tide he uses as a controlled mount.

### The Battle
The Plaguefather fights using most of the tactics described in the Demons of Decay Creature Guide. The long hallway gives him time to bombard players with necrotic missiles as they make their approach. He will use his plagueling swarms to hinder melee players from reaching him, using them in conjunction with his plague moat to make the approach difficult. 

The size of his chamber does mean he won’t be able to move far from players who manage to reach him. However, his size means he can move across the moat without hindrance, which he can do to make pursuit difficult should he need to flee his central platform.

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the plaguefather can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

* The plaguefather chooses two creatures infected with his experimental diseases that he is aware of in his layer. He chooses one that must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it gains all the symptoms of the other creature.

* The plaguefather chooses a creature within his lair that he is aware of in his lair and forces it to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is infected with an experimental disease with a random symptom determined by the Experimental Disease Table on the page after the next.

* The plaguefather chooses one plagueling swarm he is aware of in his lair and causes them to begin bloating and expanding. At the end of the plagueling swarm’s next turn, it explodes and dies. Each creature within 15 feet of the plagueling swarm must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking acid damage equal to the hit points the swarm had when it died on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Aftermath
The Plaguefather will fight to the death to protect his chamber and the cauldron within from the players. If the players flee, he won’t immediately pursue them if doing so would leave his cauldron unguarded. He will either summon minions to pursue the players or guard his cauldron while he pursues them. \
If the players manage to slay him, they will have time to investigate his chamber for valuables. Considering the difficulty of the fight and that it’s worthy of being a climactic final battle, including one or even two treasure hoards of Challenge 17+ would be appropriate. The hoard can include the wealth left behind by The Plaguefather’s victims and rare alchemical ingredients he has collected over the eons. You can also use the example items from the Demons of Decay Loot Guide as inspiration for item descriptions.

You can award the players 62,000xp for successfully completing the encounter.

\columnbreak

### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players at max level. If you have a larger group of players, or you wish to make this an especially deadly encounter designed to be the final fight of an entire campaign, you can double The Plaguefather’s hit points, bringing the total up to 868, and give him the following trait: 

<br>

>***Perfected Plague (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** If the plaguefather is reduced to half his hit points (434) or less, he may end any spells affecting him. Additionally, he chooses one symptom from the Experimental Disease Table. Any time a creature becomes infected by an experimental disease by him or from his lair actions, it gains the chosen symptom in addition to other symptoms the disease would inflict. 
>
> This ability lasts until the plaguefather completes a short or long rest.

<br>

### Adventure Follow Ups
If you wish to connect this encounter to a larger adventure, the following hooks can help provide some inspiration:
 
| d4  | Adventure Hook |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1  | This lair was the final chamber of a sprawling dungeon on the plaguefather’s home plane, and slaying him here ended his threat once and for all.|
|  2  |This lair was his seat of power in the Material Plane, and slaying him here banished him back to the realm of demons. It is now up to the players to follow him there and finish the job. |
|  3  | Soon after the players slay the plaguefather, they find the lair under siege by other unclean ones looking to claim his power and take his place. |
|  4  | This fight is part of a larger mission in which the players must slay the mightiest minion of each demon god to stop their world-ending crusade.|

#### Locus of Rot Abilities
The plague bearers who serve as commanders draw power from the infections of those around them and pass that power onto the demons they lead. Every plague-ridden and herald of decay has one of the following abilities.

***Locus of Fecundity.*** The plague bearer and each demon of decay within 30 feet of it regains 5 hit points at the start of the plague bearer’s turn per each non-demon of pestilence creature infected with Abyssal Rot within 30 feet of the plague bearer, up to a maximum of 20 hit points.
 
 ***Locus of Virulence*** The plague bearer and each demon of decay within 30 feet of it have advantage on attack rolls against creatures infected with Abyssal Rot.

***Locus of Contagion*** When a creature fails a saving throw against the Fetid Stench or Gloom of Flies abilities of a demon of decay while within 30 feet of the plague bearer, it is infected with Abyssal Rot.

\columnbreak

### Death's Heads

These vile weapons a created from the skulls of those who have succumbed to demons of decay. They are thrown like grenades that explode into clouds of rot and disease. You may equip a plague bearer exalted plague bearer, or a festering stooge with 3 death heads. If you do, increase its CR by 1. The equipt creature can throw a death’s head as an Attack action or in place of an attack that’s part of its multiattack action.

#### New Magic Item: Death's Head
*Wondrous item, uncommon*<br>
As an action, if you are not restrained or grappled, you can hurl this item at a point you can see within 30 feet that is not behind total cover. The death’s head detonates at this point, and each creature within 10 feet of it that’s not behind total cover must make a DC 15 Constituion saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 13 (3d8) necrotic damage and becomes infected by Abyssal Rot (description at the end of document). On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t infected.

When you use your action to attempt to throw the death’s head, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against you as though you moved out of their reach. If a creature hits you this way, you drop the death’s head, and it detonates at your location.

### Daemonic Gifts

You can choose any two of the following features to add to the stat block of the great unclean one or exalted unclean one. The default stat blocks have Slime Trail and Noxious Vapors.

1. ***Slime Trail.*** Any land the unclean one, or a demon of decay it is mounted on, occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain for one minute. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage for every 5 feet it travels. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 7 (3d4) acid damage. Demons of decay ignore the effects of the slime.

2. ***Noxious Vapors.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the unclean one must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. While poisoned in this way, the creature's speed is halved and it is dazed. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the Noxious Vapors of all demons of decay for 1 hour.

3. ***Infestation.*** At the start of each of the unclean one's turns, it heals a plagueling swarm or plagueling tide of its choice within 10 feet of it for 34 hit points. This healing ignores the swarm rule regarding healing. <br> If there are no such swarms within 10 feet of the unclean one below full health, it instead creates a plagueling swarm with 17 hit points inside itself as though the swarm used its ***Noxious Cradle*** ability to enter inside the unclean one. The new swarm has its own initiative and takes its turn right after the unclean one. The unclean one can have up to three swarms created by this ability at a time.

4. ***Bloated Pustules.*** The first time each turn that the unclean one is hit with an attack, puss spews out in a 15-foot cube originating from the unclean one in the direction of the attacker. Each creature in the area of the cube takes 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

## The Plaguefather

#### Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the plaguefather can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects, even while incapacitated; he can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row: 

* The plaguefather chooses two creatures infected with his experimental diseases that he is aware of in his layer. He chooses one that must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it gains all the symptoms of the other creature.

* The plaguefather chooses a creature within his layer that he is aware of in his layer and forces it to make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is infected with an experimental disease with a random symptom determined by the Experimental Disease Table on the page after the next.

* The plaguefather chooses one plagueling swarm he is aware of in his layer and causes them to begin bloating and expanding. At the end of the plagueling swarm’s next turn, it explodes and dies. Each creature within 15 feet of the plagueling swarm must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking acid damage equal to the hit points the swarm had when it died on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.


#### The Plaguefather’s Magic
While the plaguefather is an unlean one, and all unclean ones have innate spellcasting abilities, those were not included in the stat block. The plaguefather’s spell casting ability was removed to keep the stat block from becoming too large and because he will generally be better off relying on his necrotic missiles than spells. But, if you wish to keep his abilities consistent and give him the option to use magic, you can give him the following spellcasting action. 

> ***Spellcasting.*** The plague father casts one of the following spells, requiring no components and using Wisdom as his spellcasting ability (spell save DC 22, +14 to hit with spell attacks):
>
>***At will:*** *cloudkill*, *dispel magic*, *locate creature*, *rancid visitation**   
>
>***1/day each:*** *finger of death* (A creature killed by this spell becomes a **plague bearer of decay**), *heal*, *horrid wilting*

#### Experimental Diseases

When a creature is subjected to an experimental disease, roll on the following table to determine the disease’s symptoms. If the creature is already suffering from an experimental disease, the resulting symptom is added to its existing infection. All diseases inflicted this way end when the plaguefather dies. <br> Creatures normally immune to disease can still be infected with these diseases but have advantage on their saves against infection.

##### Experimental Disease Table
| d20   |  Disease Symptom  |
|:-----:|:----------:|
|   1   |  The creature takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns.| 
|   2   | The creature is poisoned.|
|   3   | The creature can't take reactions.|
|   4   | The creature can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.| 
|   5   | All attacks against the creature are made with advantage.| 
|   6   | The creature is unable to see anything farther than 10 feet away.| 
|   7   | Damage dealt by creature's attacks is halved.
|   8   | The creature's speed is halved.| 
|   9   | The creature is frightened of the plaguefather| 
|   10  | If the creature casts a spell that causes itself or another creature to regain hit points or gain temporary hit points, the target gains half that may temporary hit points or hit points instead.| 
|   11  | The creature can't make more than one attack during its turn.|
|   12  | Attack rolls can't gain disadvantage against the creature.|
|   13  | On the creature's turn, it must choose whether it gets a move or an action; it can’t do both.|  
|   14  | At the start of each of the creature's turns, it loses any concentration it's maintaining.|
|   15  | The creature can't gain advantage on attack rolls or ability checks.|
|   16  | The creature becomes brittle. While a creature is brittle, any attack that hits it is a critical hit.|
|   17  | If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1 action, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn't take effect until the creature's next turn, and the creature must use its action on that turn to complete the spell. If it can't, the spell is wasted.|
|   18  | The creature falls prone at the start of each of its turns and must use all of its movement to stand up.|
|   19  |  The creature is charmed by the plaguefather.|
|   20  | Demons of decay have advantage on saving throws against any spells the creature casts.|

>
>  ***Living Plague.*** The plaguefather is immune to diseases, and if he is targeted by a spell or effect that cures disease, such as Lay on Hands or *lesser restoration*, he takes 20 radiant damage.
>
> ***Corpulent Mass.*** The plaguefather regains 20 hit points at the start of his turn. If he takes 20 or more fire or radiant damage in a single turn, this trait doesn't function at the start of his next turn. The plaguefather dies only if he starts his turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.
>
> ***Infestation.*** At the start of each of the plaguefather's turns, he heals a plagueling swarm or plagueling tide of his choice within 10 feet of him for 64 hit points. This healing ignores the swarm rule regarding healing. <br> If there are no such swarms within 10 feet of the plaguefather below full health, he instead creates a plagueling swarm with 34 hit points inside himself as though the swarm used its ***Noxious Cradle*** ability to enter inside the plaguefather. The new swarm has its own initiative and takes its turn right after the plaguefather. The plaguefather can have up to three swarms created by this ability at a time.
>
> ***Slime Trail.*** Any land the plaguefather, or a demon of decay he is mounted on, occupies is covered in slime for the next minute, causing it to become difficult terrain for one minute. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2 (1d4) acid damage for every 5 feet it travels. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone and take 7 (3d4) acid damage. Demons of decay ignore the effects of the slime.
>
> ### Actions
>
> ***Multiattack.*** The plaguefather makes two attacks. He can use a Necrotic Missile in place of one of his attacks.
>
> ***Slam*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +13 to hit, reach 10ft., one target. *Hit:* 33 (5d10 + 6)  bludgeoning damage.
>
> ***Necrotic Missile.*** The plaguefather hurls an explosive plagueling at a point he can see within 300 feet that is not behind total cover. <br>
The plagueling detonates at this point, and each creature within 15 feet of it that's not behind total cover must make a DC 22 Constituion saving throw. <Br>
> On failure, a creature takes 40 (9d8) necrotic damage and becomes infected with an experimental disease with a symptom determined using the Experimental Disease Table on the next page. All creatures that fail the save are infected with the same disease. <br>
On a success, a creature takes half damage and isn't infected. <br>
When the plaguefather uses this action, creatures can use their reaction to make attacks of opportunity against him as though he moved out of their reach. If a creature hits him this way, he drops the plagueling, and it detonates centered on his location.
>
> ### Reactions
> ***Blubber and Bile.*** When the plaguefather takes damage, he halves the damage and then reduces it by 1d12.

> **Check.** The plaguefather makes a skill check that would normally require an action.
> 
> **Conglomerate.** Two plagueling swarms the plaguefather is aware of that have all their hit points and are within 5 feet of each other merge and become a plagueling tide. The plagueling tide has its own initiative and goes right after the plaguefather. If either of the plagueling swarms were attached to any creatures, those creatures are now grappled by the plagueling tide as though they’ve been hit by its bite attack. The plaguefather can only have one plagueling tide created this way at a time.
>
> **Summon Plaguelings.** The plaguefather targets a non-swarm creature within 300 feet that just ended its turn, causing a plagueling swarm with 34 hit points to appear centered on its location. If there is already a plagueling swarm or tide in that creature’s space, that swarm gains 34 hit points instead, and the creature that just ended its turn must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or be automatically hit by a bite attack from the swarm (no action required.) 
>
> **Swarm Surge.** A plagueling tide or swarm within 120 feet of the plaguefather moves up to its movement.
> 
> **Tenacious Will.** If the plaguefather is suffering from an effect that allows him to make a saving throw as an action or at the beginning or end of his next turn, he may immediately make that save against the effect with advantage. He can use this legendary action while incapacitated.

## New Spells

#### Rancid Visitation
*4th-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:**   1 minute
- **Classes:**  Druid, Cleric, Warlock
___

Make a melee spell attack against a creature you can reach. On a hit, it takes 4d10 necrotic damage and is afflicted with a disease that lasts until the spell ends.

A creature afflicted by this disease takes 4d10 necrotic damage at the start of each of your turns and must then make a Constitution saving throw, ending the disease on a success. 

If a diseased creature drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can end the disease on the creature and cause it to infect a new creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of it. The new creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be infected with the same disease for the remainder of the spell's duration.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, each time it would deal damage, it deals an additional 1d10 necrotic damage for each slot level above 4th.

#### Spirit Leech
*1st-level necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V S
- **Duration:**  1 hour
- **Classes:**  Warlock
___

You extend a hand towards a target creature within range and siphon away its essence. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. It takes 1d12 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. You gain temporary hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt for the duration. This spell has no effect on constructs. 

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

## Abyssal Rot
This disease is inflicted by demons and rots the body before devouring the soul. An hour after becoming infected, the victim begins displaying symptoms, and the Severity Level of the disease becomes 1. 

Whenever the creature takes necrotic or poison damage while displaying symptoms, its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured.

Every hour after the creature first displays symptoms, it repeats the saving throw against the disease, but with the save DC 1 higher than the last time the creature made the save. If the creature fails the saving throw, the Severity Level increases by 1, and it takes necrotic damage equal to 1d10 plus the disease’s Severity Level.

If the disease reduces a creature’s hit point maximum to 0, it is instantly transformed into a **plague bearer of decay**. This transformation can only be undone by a *wish* spell.

The healing touch ability of an angel or other celestial will instantly cure Abyssal Rot.

<br>

> ##### Secret Infection Rolls 
>When a player character must make a saving throw to determine if they are infected by a disease, it is usually better for the GM to make the roll in secret since the character won’t know they’re infected. <br> A Wisdom (Medicine) check can be made to determine if a creature has been infected before it starts displaying symptoms. For Abyssal Rot, a DC of 15 for this check is an appropriate baseline, though you may alter it for other diseases and circumstances.<br>
Subsequent rolls made to determine if the player character fights off the effects of the disease should usually be made by the player.


### Curing Diseases With Magical Abilities
Abilities like *lessor restoration* and Lay on Hands can instantly cure most diseases. If you wish to make diseases more difficult to remove, you can use or modify either of the following rules additions.

#### Ability Check to Cure
Whoever uses the ability to attempt to cure the disease must succeed on an ability check against the disease’s current save DC to eradicate it successfully. If the ability being used to cure the disease is a feature granted by a class with a spellcasting feature, the healer can add their Spell Attack Modifier for that class to the ability check. Otherwise, the healer can add their Wisdom modifier + their proficiency modifier to the ability check. 

If the check is being made to cure a creature that hasn’t started displaying symptoms yet, but the healer knows the creature is infected, the check is made with advantage.

#### Curing By Severity Level
When an ability that cures diseases is used on a diseased creature, it only reduces the severity level by 1.  
If you are using the Ability Check to Cure rule, you can allow the healer to reduce an additional severity level if the check’s result was 5 or more over the disease’s DC. You can extend this rule to allow a result of 10 over the DC to cure 2 additional severity levels, 15 over the DC to cure 3 additional severity levels, and so on.
