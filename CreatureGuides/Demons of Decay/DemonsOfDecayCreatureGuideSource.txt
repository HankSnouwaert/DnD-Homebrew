# Demons of Decay Creature Guide
This document contains a collection of resources to help you run adventures featuring demons of rot and pestilence. These resources are divided into Encounter Guides, Loot Guides, and Example Encounters. Encounter Guides will help you understand the mindset, motivations, and tactics of the creatures, so you have a better idea of how to play them. Loot Guides provide alternate ways to provide treasure found after defeating these enemies. Example Encounters will provide encounter scenarios involving these creatures and instructions on how to run them.

## Encounter Guides
These guides explore the motivations and tactics of specific creatures to help provide richer roleplaying experiences when using them. Motivations determine the priorities the creature has and what goals it is likely to form based on them. Tactics determine the means through which the creature is most likely to achieve those goals. Motivations and tactics apply when roleplaying wild beasts looking for their next meal, as well as major characters serving as antagonists for an entire campaign.

### Motivations

Understanding a creature's motivations will help you give it goals that may put it into direct conflict with the players. If players can decern that a creature has goals that aren't just "be an enemy for the players to defeat," it will breathe more life into the world and give the players a chance to make more informed decisions as to how to deal with the creature. 

This section of the guide will provide examples of common motivations for these types of creatures in general and specialized motivations for more unique creatures.


### Tactics

Understanding a creature's preferred tactics will help you form a strategy for how the creature will attempt to achieve its goals and guide you in making the most of the creature's abilities. Players who can recognize a creature's tactics will then have a chance to make note of them and attempt to adjust their own tactics accordingly.

This section of the guide will provide examples of how the creatures prefer to initiate combat, what tactics they use during combat, and what they will do if they are losing.

## Loot Guides

The DMG contains Individual Treasure tables listing the number of coins that can be dropped by creatures of different CRs. However, many creatures have no reason to carry coins or even have them within their vicinity. Other creatures may carry wealth in the form of items whose value isn't apparent at first glance. 


And sometimes, items are hidden away in nearby areas that are difficult to spot. How different CRs are split among the tables also results in creatures of wildly different power levels dropping the same amounts of wealth.

You can use these loot guides if you wish to provide your players with alternate sources of wealth when they slay monsters that don't carry money, let players use their skills to collect wealth, or just provide treasure that scales more closely with creature CR.

The guides provide rules for allowing players to loot valuable goods from their foes' corpses or the surrounding area after an encounter. This looting can be done using a skill check made by one of the players, with the type of check required dependent on the type of item the player wishes to collect and how the item is being collected. The more successful the check, the more goods the player is able to collect. 

> ##### What’s Alternate Loot Good For?
>Treasure other than coins, gems, and art objects can be used to provide forms of wealth that better fit the context of the current environment. Players with the right skill sets might also be able to use valuables they find this way to craft useful items. These could be handy mundane items or even magic items. Hide and bone could be crafted into weapons and armor, while potent plants or liquids could form the base for a potion.

## Demons of Decay Encounter Guide

These demons represent the existential terror that comes from knowing all things will eventually succumb to entropy and rot away. They are drawn to people and places where that decay is most apparent and revel in the tendency of mortals to neglect themselves and the world they live in, thus allowing disease and entropy to run their course unopposed. Mortals who wish to overcome the hardships of disease and decay may make pacts with these demons, forfeiting their souls for greater physical and mental resilience. 

Players are most likely to encounter these demons when they’ve been summoned by such mortals. But demons of decay may also spawn in locations that have allowed neglect and entropy to run rampant. A moldering town, a neglected sewer, or a disease-ridden city are all places where demons of decay may manifest themselves and begin spreading their plagues.



### Demon of Decay Motivations

In contrast to their grizzly appearance and nihilistic associations, demons of decay have cheery dispositions. They see the inevitable deterioration of all things as something to be celebrated, and they seek to hasten this process wherever they go. Death and decay are natural parts of the cycle of life and rebirth, and they promote this cycle by rotting away mortals and using their corpses to birth foul demons.  

It is equally important to demons of decay that they spread life wherever they go. This life just happens to be in the form of virulent diseases and parasites. To demons of decay, it is an honor to carry such life, and they are eager to impart their “gifts” to as many mortals as possible.

When role-playing demons of decay, you can have them behave in a jovial and benevolent manner. When they spread diseases, they believe they are altruistically promoting life and passing blessings onto the infected. When they inflict rot and decay on objects and creatures, they see themselves as bringing beauty into the world. There is a playfulness to their work, and demons of decay are always ready to celebrate rot and ruin being brought into the world.


#### Common Demon of Decay Motivations
* Bring about ruin through decay
* Spread different types of diseases
* Celebrate with other demons of decay
* Collect components used to brew new plagues
* Eliminate any who specialize in healing or curing diseases
* Persuade mortals to worship demon lords of decay

### Demon of Decay Tactics
These fiends share many similar characteristics that lead to certain fighting styles. 

***Resilience.*** Demons of decay usually have low AC but high amounts of health. They also often have regenerative abilities that they can pass on to each other. These traits lead to them being accustomed to taking a lot of hits. 

***Melee Oritanted.*** Demons of decay usually have better melee options than ranged options. There are exceptions to this, but it is usually in their best interest close in on foes from all sides and keep players locked up in melee combat.

***Limited Mobility Options.*** Demons of decay have access to multiple steeds, but as far as mounts go, none of them are particularly fast. Demons of decay usually want to find ways to bog players down so they can avoid being out-maneuvered, especially since they do best when they can close into melee range.

***Debuffs & Damage Over Time Effects.*** Demons of decay usually don’t do outrageous amounts of damage all at once. Instead, they prefer to infect players with effects that whittle them down over time. They also leave hazardous terrain across the battlefield, which does damage over time and helps tip maneuverability options in their favor.



#### Engagement

Because of their poor stealth, most demons of decay won’t be able to surprise the players. And their reliance on melee attacks means the fight will often start with them shambling toward the players as quickly as possible and bogging them down in close combat. Demons of decay usually perform better when grouped up, so they will try to converge on their targets into a massed group, coming from multiple angles when possible.


#### Combat

Demons of decay show little concern for their well-being and will risk taking heavy damage if it means they can subject the players to their attacks and abilities. Because they often use abilities that deal damage over time, demons of decay try to “spread the love” to as many players as possible to maximize these abilities. Players that can cure or mitigate the putrid abilities of these demons quickly earn their ire and become the highest priority targets.

#### Retreat
Demons of decay never retreat out of fear for their existence, even when on their home plane where death would be permanent. They see their end as simply part of the natural way of things. They usually only flee a battle to get reinforcements, find more appealing victims, or lure pursuers into a more exposed position for a counterattack.

#### Tactics: Plague Bearers of Decay

TThe rank-and-file of these demons have straightforward tactics. They simply want to surround players en masse so they will be overwhelmed by their demonic stench and then use their melee attacks to infect as many players as possible. Grouping up is generally to their advantage as it empowers their Fetid Stench ability. 

While staying together in a loose group, plague bearer will distribute their attacks amongst players to attempt to infect as many of them as possible. Plague bearers can sense when a player has been successfully infected, and they focus their attacks on the uninfected. Once all players are infected, they will usually prioritize whichever players have been overcome by their Fetid Stench.

As with all demons of decay, plague bearers will make slaying healers their priority, especially anyone curing diseases.

If a plague bearer has death heads at its disposal, it will hang back and bombard non-infected players from afar until it runs out of ammo and needs to close into melee.

##### Exalted Plague Bearers
These elite demons generally use the same tactics as their lesser kin. Their ranged attacks give them greater flexibility in who they can target, and they may opt to stay out of melee range of players if approaching is difficult or there are players well out of melee reach they want to attempt to infect.

##### Festering Stooges 

These strange demons will attempt to position themselves to subject as many players as possible to the effect of their Gloom of Flies. If the players are all spread out, they will go after the player with the fewest escape options.

##### Plague-Ridden and Heralds of Decay
These demons act as leaders to other demons of decay and will wade into the thick of combat where they can put their locus ability to best use. Using locus traits to their maximum potential means ideally being near several infected players and other demons of decay at the same time. 

They possess several spells they can use to turn the tide of battle in their favor.


***Plague-Ridden Spells.***

***Cloudkill.*** This is a perfect opening spell that can be used to force ranged players out of advantageous positions and closer into melee range. If the plague-ridden can hit two or more players with this spell before they’ve moved into melee range, they will.

***Inflict Rot.*** This spell is ideal when the players are grouped together and tied up in melee combat. The plague-ridden will target the player that appears to have the lowest constitution, avoiding fighters and barbarians. 

***Blight.*** This is usually the last spell the plague-ridden will cast, and it will prioritize players infected with Abyssal Rot or under the effects of the Inflict Rot spell in an attempt to quickly subdue them.

\columnbreak

***Herald of Decay Spells.***

***Circle of Death.*** The herald will cast this spell as soon as it can hit three or more players with it. Since demons of decay are immune to necrotic damage, it doesn’t have to worry about them being within the spell’s area.

***Harm.*** This is a good opening spell when the herald hasn’t yet gotten into melee range. The herald is good at intuiting the saving throw capabilities of players and will target someone it doesn’t think is likely to pass the save.

***Regenerate.*** The herald will usually cast this on itself if it is below half health and supporting multiple minions with its locus ability. If there is another particularly powerful demon it is fighting alongside, it may opt to target that demon to keep it in the fight longer.
