# Tomb Kingdoms Creature Guide
This document contains a collection of resources to help you run adventures heavily featuring ancient Egyptian-inspired legions of undead and constructs. These resources are divided into Encounter Guides, Loot Guides, and Example Encounters. Encounter Guides will help you understand the mindset, motivations, and tactics of the creatures, so you have a better idea of how to play them. Loot Guides provide alternate ways to provide treasure found after defeating these enemies. Example Encounters will provide encounter scenarios involving these creatures and instructions on how to run them.

## Encounter Guides
These guides explore the motivations and tactics of specific creatures to help provide richer roleplaying experiences when using them. Motivations determine the priorities the creature has and what goals it is likely to form based on them. Tactics determine the means through which the creature is most likely to achieve those goals. Motivations and tactics apply when roleplaying wild beasts looking for their next meal, as well as major characters serving as antagonists for an entire campaign.

### Motivations

Understanding a creature's motivations will help you give it goals that may put it into direct conflict with the players. If players can decern that a creature has goals that aren't just "be an enemy for the players to defeat," it will breathe more life into the world and give the players a chance to make more informed decisions as to how to deal with the creature. 

This section of the guide will provide examples of common motivations for these types of creatures in general and specialized motivations for more unique creatures.


### Tactics

Understanding a creature's preferred tactics will help you form a strategy for how the creature will attempt to achieve its goals and guide you in making the most of the creature's abilities. Players who can recognize a creature's tactics will then have a chance to make note of them and attempt to adjust their own tactics accordingly.

This section of the guide will provide examples of how the creatures prefer to initiate combat, what tactics they use during combat, and what they will do if they are losing.

## Loot Guides

The DMG contains Individual Treasure tables listing the number of coins that can be dropped by creatures of different CRs. However, many creatures have no reason to carry coins or even have them within their vicinity. Other creatures may carry wealth in the form of items whose value isn't apparent at first glance. 


And sometimes, items are hidden away in nearby areas that are difficult to spot. How different CRs are split among the tables also results in creatures of wildly different power levels dropping the same amounts of wealth.

You can use these loot guides if you wish to provide your players with alternate sources of wealth when they slay monsters that don't carry money, let players use their skills to collect wealth, or just provide treasure that scales more closely with creature CR.

The guides provide rules for allowing players to loot valuable goods from their foes' corpses or the surrounding area after an encounter. This looting can be done using a skill check made by one of the players, with the type of check required dependent on the type of item the player wishes to collect and how the item is being collected. The more successful the check, the more goods the player is able to collect. 

> ##### Whatâ€™s Alternate Loot Good For?
>Treasure other than coins, gems, and art objects can be used to provide forms of wealth that better fit the context of the current environment. Players with the right skill sets might also be able to use valuables they find this way to craft useful items. These could be handy mundane items or even magic items. Hide and bone could be crafted into weapons and armor, while potent plants or liquids could form the base for a potion.

## Tomb Kingdoms Encounter Guide

The tomb kingdoms are all that remain of an ancient empire that had grown so powerful it believed it could conquer death. The egos of this empire's pharaohs were such that they could accept the prospect of their end or that of their kingdom. Thus, incalculable resources went into the study of necromantic magics and the construction of massive statues and necropolises meant to immortalize their kingdom. The rulers of these realms have been preserved along with their armies, and they seek to reclaim the lost glory of their kingdom.

Players are most likely to come into conflict with denizens of the tomb kingdoms while exploring the lands they once ruled. The tombs, temples, and vaults of the tomb kingdoms all make for excellent adventuring locations that pit the players against these eternal warriors. The players may also encounter tomb kingdom forces outside their homes if they are seeking to reclaim lost treasure or exact vengeance on any who earned their ire.


### Tomb Kingdom Motivations


Ratfolk, at their core, seek power above all else. The form this power takes can vary between ratfolk, depending on where their talents lie. Ratfolk of the ninja clans see obtaining mastery of their deadly arts as the most reliable means of obtaining power and elevating their status. Mastery and status are obtained by carrying out missions on behalf of their clan or whoever is paying for their services. As such, most of their motivations will be tied to carrying out whatever task has been assigned to them. Individuals within the clan may have their own personal agendas, but should they be caught crossing the clan, they will be quickly eliminated.

#### Tomb Kingdom Motivations
* Punish trespassers
* Reclaim lost treasures
* Carry out last received orders
* Reclaim territory formerly held in life
* Exact vengeance for past grievances
* Gather knowledge of necromantic arts
* Rebuild ruined structures or statues
* Carry out wishes of a patron deity

### Tomb Kingdom Tactics
The armies of the tomb kingdoms are varied, and their tactics will depend on their goals, the environment, and what creatures they have at their disposal. Still, there are some commonalities between many of their creatures. Skeleton warriors are used en masse to distract or overwhelm players, but their methods of attack are usually straightforward. The large construct monsters provide much heavier hitting forces, each serving a more specialized role that can be combined with the more general-purpose skeletons. The leaders of the tomb kingdoms are powerful in their own right, but they rely on their minions to truly shine, each possessing spells or abilities that enhance other undead.

\columnbreak



#### Engagement

Most tomb kingdom creatures either lie in wait beneath the sands, or they can appear indistinguishable from inanimate statues. This means tomb kingdom creatures will generally attempt ambushes whenever possible. They are patient and will usually wait to attack until they are spotted or they have the opportunity to attack from an advantageous position. 
When an ambush isn't possible, tomb kingdom creatures march implacably after the players, letting nothing deter them from their goal.

Ratfolk ninjas also enjoy attacking players who are engaged with other foes, making it much easier to sneak up on unsuspecting party members. If the players manage to catch them on the back foot, most ratfolk ninjas will attempt to retreat and regroup for a surprise counterattack when the players are more vulnerable.


#### Combat

Tomb kingdom creatures and implacable and utterly focused on their objectives in combat. While the exact tactics of each creature vary, the discipline with which the creatures execute their tactics does not. The sophistication and adaptability of different creatures depend on the level of sentience of the highest-ranking creature there. Skeletons acting without a leader may execute their techniques without fail, but they aren't very adaptable. 

When using leaderless statues and low-level soldiers, have them execute their standard tactics and fight to the death regardless of changes to the situation. Leadership from tomb king priests or nobles can allow them to adapt to changing circumstances more easily and better counter whatever the players are attempting.

#### Retreat
Tomb kingdom creatures are entirely fearless and utterly devoted to following any orders given to them. They will never lose their morale or flee and will only retreat when ordered to. The kings and priests may flee to save themselves, but they are unlikely to panic, and many will stubbornly fight to the end if they feel the stakes are high enough. A tomb kingdom ruler who is forced to retreat will undoubtedly hold a grudge and likely seek vengeance in the future, even if it takes years.


\pagebreakNum


#### Tactics: Skeletal Soldiers

These soldiers are the least sentient and most expendable tomb kingdom creatures. Isolated groups of them can serve as low-level threats to players, and at higher levels, they can be used to overwhelm the players with numbers or to bog them down and set up attacks from more powerful creatures. In the event of a retreat, skeletons can also slow down the players and allow more important creatures to escape. 

Skeletal soldiers still retain their intuition for battle tactics and know how to position themselves for the optimal use of their weapons. They can also recognize high-threat targets, such as players dealing bludgeoning damage, and they will focus on eliminating such threats. However, they are usually not intelligent enough to recognize a threat before it becomes obvious. For example, they wonâ€™t understand a mace will deal extra damage, only that the player with the mace appears to be doing more damage and is, therefore, a more significant threat. They can also recognize when players are resistant to their damage or have such high defense that attacking them would be inefficient.

***Skeleton Spearmen.*** These skeletons have retained enough of their training to know how to maneuver and optimally use the reach of their spears while making counterattacks against them difficult. Each spearman has two extra spears on hand. 

***The Scorpion Legion.*** These skeletons are excellent at ganging up on a single player and debuffing them with the poisoned condition while racking up large amounts of poison damage.

***Skeleton Archers.*** These skeletons will stay out of melee range, using the Disengage action when needed to keep players at a distance. They will keep other melee skeletons between themselves and the players when possible.

***The Hawk Legion.*** While most archers should stay out of melee combat, this legion's Sacred Arrows ability allows them to snipe players from more flexible locations, making it even easier to keep them out of reach of the players.


##### Tomb Warriors
These soldiers combine the skeletonâ€™s lack of self-preservation with zealous bloodlust. They should be played very aggressively and will usually charge after the highest threat target they can reach. Most of the time, this will be any player wielding a bludgeoning weapon. They are intelligent enough to assess how difficult it will be to knock a given weapon out of someoneâ€™s hands and will usually start with easier targets. 

If they are being directed by a more intelligent commander, it can also often be advantageous to command them to knock a spell focus from a casterâ€™s hands. Once the caster can no longer cast defensive spells, a squad of tomb warriors can quickly cut them down to size.

***Legion of the Netherworld.***  These warriors fight similarly to normal tomb warriors, but their ethereal abilities add an extra layer of complexity. Use their Incorporeal Movement to sneak up on high-priority targets more easily while evading counterattacks. Players with magical bludgeoning weapons are the highest priority, and netherworld warriors will focus on disarming them and knocking their weapons into the Ethereal Plane if possible.

\columnbreak

##### Tomb Guard
These elite soldiers and bodyguards retain more of their sentience than other skeletons. They can execute more complex strategies and have enough awareness to change their tactics when needed. However, they still lack a true sense of self-preservation and will throw their unlives away at the command of their masters. If they are left masterless, they will continue to guard anything belonging to the master and will seek vengeance on any who slay their master. 

The combination of their Halting Strikes and Reactive Strike abilities allows tomb guards to prevent players from reaching those they are charged with protecting. If their master is present, they will stay within 10 feet of it to ensure no one gets by. This then gives the master the opportunity to move further out of reach while the tomb guards harry the players. If tomb guards are working alongside other ranged units, they can protect them in a similar way.

While tomb guards are aware of their weakness to bludgeoning damage, their highest priority will be whoever is the greatest threat to their master.

***Eternal Guard.*** These skeletons operate similarly to normal tomb guards.

## Tomb Kingdom Loot Guide
The tomb kingdoms were known for their wealth and spared no expense when outfitting their most prized soldiers and monstrous constructs. The formerly human soldiers and leaders drop items the same way most humanoids would, while the constructs can usually be harvested for valuable materials used in their creation. Many times the most valuable treasure isn't dropped by defeated creatures but is found hidden nearby.

### Lootable Tomb Kingdom Items

Most dropped valuables can be found using the same methods, but some treasure is less obvious and mixed in with worthless objects, thus requiring some knowledge and discernment to identify. Use which ever harvesting methods you feel are most appropriate given the type of treasure and the situation. 

##### Tomb Kingdom Looting Checks
| Type of Item  | Skill Used to Loot Item | 
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  Dropped or Hidden Valuables  | Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) | 
|  Items of Religious or Arcane Significance |  Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (History), or Intelligence (Religion) |  


The number of items looted and the value of those items will depend on how well the players do on their skill check. The difficulty in looting may be in finding valuables hidden nearby, spotting items that haven't been too badly damaged, or recognizing the value of an item that might appear mundane at first glance. 

You can give the different types of items unique names based on their material and value to help differentiate them from one another. The following table provides some example names. If an item is in especially good condition, it is worth twice as much. A version of the item in poor condition is worth half as much. For example, Ornate Cloth may be worth 10gp, but a Pristine Ornate Cloth would be worth 20gp, and a Tron Ornate Cloth would be worth 5gp. Bone may be cracked, gems may be flawed, metal corroded, and wood splintered, cutting their value in half, and any item in pristine condition can be worth twice as much. In this way, you can create items of many values with little effort.


##### Example Item Names
| Value  | Cloth | Bone | Gem  | Metal | Wood |
|:---:|:-----:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1gp | Ancient Cloth | Dried Bone |  Polished Stone  |  Blade Fragment | Ancient Wood |
|  10gp| Ornate Cloth | Preserved Bone |  Lapis Lazuli |  Intact Blade | Preserved Wood |
|  100gp| Ritual Garb | Runed Bone |  Amethyst  |  Ritual-Blade Fragment | Runed Wood |
|  1,000gp| Sacred Garb |  Sacred Bone |  Emerald   | Ritual-Blade | Sacred Wood |

### Loot Tables

# Example Tomb Kingdom Encounters

## Skeleton Dig <br> (Player Level: 2-4)
In this encounter, the players excavate a dig site for as much treasure as possible before an incoming storm buries it out of their reach. However, each time they dig, they risk unearthing hostile skeletal soldiers from ages past.


### Encounter Context
This encounter assumes the players have found themselves at an established dig site. The excavators who established it have warned the players of the hostile skeletons below the dig site guarding the buried treasure. The excavators are now retreating to a more secure location to make camp and protect themselves from the incoming storm and inform the players that the storm is likely to bury the entire site out of their reach by the time it passes. They offer the players the use of their digging equipment if they'd like to try their hand at any last-minute excavating before the site is lost.

### Lead Up

When the players arrive at the dig site, all is quiet. Threats won't appear until they start unearthing them.

### Map Description
* **Lighting.** This depends on the time of day, and there will likely be daylight at the start of the encounter. Be sure to track daylight as the players spend time at the dig and reduce the lighting accordingly. 
* **Elevated Areas.** The areas of the map marked in green are each roughly 10 feet higher than the next lowest area. Ladders will be on hand to aid the players in moving up and down the cliffs surrounding the dig site.
* **Rough Terrain.** The rocks and the statue head marked in yellow are all rough terrain.

### Digging for Treasure
This encounter centers on the players making best guesses as to wear to dig for treasure while managing their time and the risk of unearthing skeletal foes. The mechanics below can help you run this scenario.

#### How To Dig
Any number of the players can work to excavate a 10-foot by 10-foot area of the dig site over one or more hours. Over the course of an hour, a player working at digging exerts an amount of Effort equal to their Strength score. Players working together combine their Effort. After 44 Effort has been expended on a given area, it is excavated. 
A player can choose to double their Effort, but they must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw after doing so or suffer a level of exhaustion. 






\columnbreak

##### Encounter Map: Ruined Town

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>



> ##### Digging Through Unusual Means
> A creature with the ability to magically move earth each round, such as using the *mold earth* cantrip, can apply an Effort of 20 rather than use its Strength score. A creature with a burrow speed can apply Effort equal to twice its Strength score. Other spells and abilities that explicitly move earth may be used to excavate areas even faster.


#### Is There is Anything to Dig Up?


Once the party decides to excavate or assess a 10-foot by 10-foot area, roll a d4. On a result of 4, there is something there for them to dig up. 

Before attempting a dig, the party can make an Intelligence (History), Intelligence (Investigation), Intelligence (Nature), or Wisdom (Survival) check to attempt to assess if an area contains anything worth digging up. This check should be rolled by you, and the result should be kept secret from the players. What they learn is determined by how well they do on their check, as shown in the Dig Assessment Result table on the next page.



<img src='https://i.ibb.co/1KQ11JG/Dig-sight-Guide.png' style='position:absolute; top:125px; right:5px; width:415px; ' />


\pagebreakNum


##### Dig Assessment Result
| Assessment Check Result  | Information Result | 
|:---:|:-----------:
|  8 or Less |  The players come to the wrong conclusion as to whether something is buried there. | 
|  9-15 | The players learn nothing. |  
|  16-19| The players accurately determine if thereâ€™s something to dig up. |  
|  20 or More | The players accurately determine if thereâ€™s something to dig up and if itâ€™s loot or a treasure horde. |  
#### What's Dug Up?

Roll on the Unearthed Contents Table below to determine what the party digs up. Then roll on the appropriate treasure table to determine what the players find. To determine the descriptions for the items the players find, you can use Tomb Kingdom Loot Guide, use treasure examples of similar value from the DMG, or make up items of your own. If the players unearth an encounter, consult The Encounters section below.

##### Unearthed Contents Table
| 1d8  | What's Unearthed | 
|:---:|:-----------:
|  1-2 | Minor Treasure | 
|  3| Major Treasure |  
|  4-7 | Minor Treasure & An Encounter |
|  8 | Major Treasure & An Encounter |

##### Minor Treasure Loot Table

| 1d20 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-5  | 1d4(2) 5gp Items |
|  6-11 | 1d4(2) 10gp Items | 
|  12-17 | 1d6(3) 10gp Items  |  
|  18-20 |  1d4(2) 20gp Items |  

##### Major Treasure Loot Table

| 1d20 |  Loot  |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  1-7  | 1d4(2) 20gp Items |
|  8-12 | 1 50gp Item | 
|  13-16 | 1d4(2) 50gp Items  |  
|  17-20 |  1d4(2) 100gp Items |  



### The Encounters
When the players unearth an encounter, roll on the Unearthed Encounters below to determine the enemies they face. You can spread the creatures out anywhere within 30 feet of the excavated area as they burrow out into better positions. All the creatures appear at the same time, and having to crawl through the sand means they roll for initiative with disadvantage and start their turns prone.

\columnbreak

##### Unearthed Encounters
| 1d8  | Encounter Composition | 
|:---:|:-----------:
|  1 | Skeleton Archer x2, Skeleton Spearman x2  | 
|  2 | Skeleton Spearman x2, Tomb Warrior x1 |  
|  3 | Tomb Warrior x3  |
|  4 | Skeleton Archer x1, Tomb Guard x1 |
|  5 | Tomb Guard x2 | 
|  6 | Skeleton Spearman x5 |  
|  7 | Skeleton Archer x2, Tomb Warrior x2 |
|  8 | Skeleton Archer x1, Skeleton Spearman x1, Tomb Guard x1, Tomb Warrior x1 |

#### Encounter Tactics
The skeletons mostly use the tactics described in the Tomb Kingdoms Encoutner Guide. They have no thought other than to guard the treasures they were buried with. If the players flee the dig site, the skeletons pursue them if they are carrying any treasure from the dig site. If the players have no treasure or escape the skeletons, they will turn their attention to slaying those in the nearby camp to reclaim the treasures the excavators took. 

### The Approaching Storm
A slow-moving but very intense storm is bearing down on the dig site, threatening to tear apart everything in its path. Every 3 hours, the storm gets worse, making digging more difficult. Use the table below to determine how much effort it takes to dig and save DC to avoid exhaustion for digging at a faster rate based on how much time has passed.

##### Dig Assessment Result
| Hours Passed  | Exhaustion Constitution Save DC | Effort Required to Excavate
|:---:|:----:|:----:|
|  0-3 | 13 | 44 | 
|  3-6 | 15 | 55 |
|  6-9 | 17 | 66 |
|  9-12 | 19 | 77 |
|  12+ | 21 | 88 |

After 12 hours, the storm starts dealing 1d4 slashing damage to creatures every minute they spend exposed to its winds.

### Aftermath
The encounter ends whenever the players decide to retreat from the dig site to the sheltered camp. The camp is about a 5-minute run away from the dig site, though players encumbered with treasure will take 10 minutes to reach it. The players will be allowed to keep everything they found.

\pagebreakNum

#### XP Award
For each treasure stash the players successfully recover, award them 400 XP. 


### Adjusting the Difficulty
The encounter assumes you are playing with 4 players in the suggested level range. If the players' levels are outside the suggested level range, or you have a different group size, you can adjust the encounter's difficulty accordingly.

**Harder Encounter (Levels 5-7).** Replace skeleton spearmen with scorpion legion spearmen, skeleton archers with hawk legion archers, tomb warriors with netherworld legion warriors, and tomb guards with eternal guards. 

Increase the XP awarded for each recovered treasure stash to 2,900 XP. 

Use the high-level treasure tables below in place of the treasure tables listed in the encounterâ€™s description.
