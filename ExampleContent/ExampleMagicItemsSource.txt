I would like this chat to be used for cleaning up rough drafts of D&D magic items for use in GM Binder. The description text should follow the general format of magic items published by Wizards of the Coast for their 2024 content, NOT the older 2014 format of spells. I am going to provide a list of already "cleaned up" magic items you can use as a reference for formatting. I want the cleaned-up magic items you provide to be ready to copy and paste straight into the GM Binder. 

Before I provide the list of magic items, is there any further clarification needed?



Here is the list of magic items. Ignore things like pagebreaks and columnbreaks between the magic items.


\pagebreakNum

#### Eye of the Vermin God
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 6,000 gp*

*This smooth orb continuously glints with a faint red light, as if reflecting an unseen source, regardless of surrounding illumination. It grants the holder the ability to call upon the children of the Vermin God to act as their eyes.*

While attuned to this item, you ignore the one-familiar limitation of the *Find Familiar* spell and can have up to three familiars, provided all are **Rats**. If you attempt to summon a familiar that is not a **Rat**, all existing familiars disappear.

#### Hex-Stone Amulet
*Wondrous Item, Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 36,000 gp*

*This pendant, crafted from rough-cut stones, emits a sickly green light. When grasped tightly in dire moments, it fills the user with unholy resilience for a fleeting moment before exacting a terrible toll.*

Whenever you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it, but you must use the new result. You then gain one level of Exhaustion.

#### Hex Stone Token 
*Wonderous Item, Rare, 200g*

*These palm-size wafers of magical minerals can be consumed to boost one's magical abilities. However, their hazardous nature means most non-ratfolk creatures aren't willing to take such a reckless risk for the extra power.*

While in possession of one or more hex stone tokens, you can use an Action to eat any number of tokens to regain one expended spell slot of your choice. If the expended slot level is higher than the number of tokens eaten, the new slot level is equal to the number of tokens eaten. You must then succeed on a Constitution saving throw, taking an amount of Necrotic damage based on the number of tokens eaten on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

Your hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This damage and hit point maximum reduction can't be reduced or prevented in any way except by succeeding on the saving throw, and it lasts until you finish a long rest. 

The amount of Necrotic damage taken and DC of the saving throw depend on the number of tokens eaten, as shown in the Hex Stone Token Table below.

##### Hex Stone Token Table 
| Number of Tokens  | Save DC |  Damage  |
|:---:|:---------:| :---------:|
|  1  | 13 | 2d6|
|  2  | 14 | 4d6|
|  3  | 16 | 6d6|
|  4  | 17 | 7d6|
|  5  | 19 | 9d6|
|  6  | 22 | 12d6|
|  7  | 23 | 13d6|
|  8  | 24 | 14d6|
|  9  | 27 | 17d6|

#### Gnawfang
*Weapon (Dagger), Very Rare (Requires Attunement), 2,000 gp*

*Carved from a sliver of the Rat God's fang, this alabaster dagger sheds small white fragments when it pierces flesh. These fragments voraciously burrow deeper into the victim’s body, consuming everything in their path.*

Whenever you hit a creature with this dagger, fragments burrow into the target’s flesh, Infesting it. While Infested, the target takes 2d4 Piercing damage at the end of each of its turns. A creature within reach can use an action to attempt a Wisdom (Medicine) check (DC equals your spell save DC) to remove the shards using a weapon or object that deals Piercing or Slashing damage. On a success, the target takes 1d4 damage of the same type, and the effect ends. A creature can make this check with advantage, but the target takes 3d4 damage instead.

#### Staff of Ruin
*Staff, Very Rare (Requires Attunement by a Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard), 32,000 gp*

*Gripped by many ratfolk prophets throughout the ages, each treacherously slain by another who hungered for its power, this staff can call down the loathsome might of the great Rat God.*

The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d6 + 4 charges daily at dawn. When you hit a creature with a spell attack while holding the staff, it deals an extra 1d4 damage per ally the target has within 5 feet of it who isn’t Incapacitated (up to three allies).

***Spells.*** While holding the staff, you can cast one of the spells on the following table from it, using your spell save DC. The table indicates how many charges you must expend to cast the spell. (Spell descriptions found at the end of the document.)

| Spell  | Charge Cost |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  *Death Frenzy*  | 1 |
|  *Flensing Ruin*  | 3|
|  *Dreadful Scorch*  | 4 |
|  *Galvanic Bolts*  | 5 |


#### Blessed Blade of The Sun God
*Weapon (Glaive), Legendary (Requires Attunement by a Paladin), 40,000 gp*

*Blessed by the Sun God, and wielded by the greatest pharaoh to ever live, this glaive’s edge glows with the heat of the ancient desert, delivering divine judgment to those who oppose its wielder.*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon. Additionally, you gain a +3 bonus to spell attack rolls and the saving throw DCs of your paladin spells.

When you use your Divine Smite feature on a creature hit by this weapon, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to your Paladin spell save DC). On a failed save, the creature is Blinded until the end of its next turn.

#### Destroyer of Eternities
*Weapon (Greatsword), Very Rare, 32,000 gp*

*Perhaps the deadliest weapon forged by the ancient dynasties, this greatsword was devised by a pharaoh to ensure no rival would challenge his rule. It obliterates armor, flesh, bone, and soul alike, denying its victims the golden paradise of the afterlife—a fate feared above all by the tomb pharaohs.*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, and it deals Force damage instead of Slashing damage.

If a creature has 25 hit points or fewer after taking damage from this weapon, or if you roll a 20 on an attack roll with it, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be destroyed. A creature destroyed this way can only be restored to life by a *True Resurrection* or *Wish* spell.

As an action, you can make a melee attack with this weapon against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.
