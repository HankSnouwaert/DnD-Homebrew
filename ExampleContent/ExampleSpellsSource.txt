I would like this chat to be used for cleaning up rough drafts of D&D spells for use in GM Binder. The spells should follow the general format of spells published by Wizards of the Coast for their 2024 content, NOT the older 2014 format of spells. I am going to provide a list of already "cleaned up" spells you can use as a reference for formatting. I want the cleaned-up spells you provide to be ready to copy and paste straight into the GM Binder. 

Before I provide the list of spells, is there any further clarification needed?



Here is the list of spells. Ignore things like pagebreaks and columnbreaks between the spells.

#### Apotheosis
*4th-level Evocation (Bard, Cleric, Paladin)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You choose a creature within range that you can see and infuse it with pure magic, causing it to regain a number of hit points equal to 4d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier and emit a wave of ascendant authority in a 30-foot emanation. 

Each creature of the target's choice that it can see within the emanation must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of the target until the end of your next turn.

While Frightened, it can't take reactions and must take the Dash action to move away from the source of its fear by the safest available route.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The healing increases by 2d10 for each slot level above 4th.

#### Dampen Magic
*2nd-level Abjuration (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** Reaction, which you take when you see a creature within 60 feet of yourself casting a spell with verbal, somatic, or material components
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the spell is dampened. The caster can still choose to cast the spell, but it becomes weakened, and until the end of the your next turn:

* Attack rolls made by the spell have disadvantage.
* Targets have advantage on saving throws made to resist the spell.
* If the spell allows a creature to make a saving throw to take only half damage, a successful save causes no damage, and a failed save causes half damage instead.

If the caster chooses not to cast the spell, the action, bonus action, or reaction used to cast it is wasted, but the spell slot is not expended.

#### Disruptive Pulse
*Evocation Cantrip (Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a wave of nullifying energy toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 Thunder damage.

If the target is concentrating on a spell and must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration as a result of this damage, you can choose to set the saving throw DC equal to your spell save DC instead of the normal DC.

***Cantrip Upgrade.*** The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach levels 5 (2d8), 11 (3d8), and 17 (4d8).

#### Eldritch Deliverance
*1st-level Evocation (Warlock)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a shard of meteorite)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a sudden pulse of eldritch energy at a point you can see within range. Each creature in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 2d6 Force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The damage increases by 2d6, the radius increases by 5 feet, and the range increases by 10 feet for each slot level above 1st.

#### Flames of the Phoenix
*7th-level Conjuration (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Cction
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (an egg shell)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure a fiery phoenix that blazes across the battlefield. A phoenix made of flame appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within range and immediately moves up to 60 feet in a straight line, stopping early if it encounters an impassable barrier. The phoenix can pass through openings large enough for a Tiny creature.

At the end of its movement, the phoenix erupts in an explosion of magical fire. All creatures in its path, as well as those within a 15-foot radius of the point where it explodes, must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 7d8 Fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

After the explosion, the phoenix leaves behind a hovering ember at the point where it detonated. The ember remains for the duration of the spell.

**Reviving the Phoenix.** As an action on your turn, you can command the ember to reconstitute into the phoenix. When you do, the phoenix reforms in the ember’s space, moves up to 60 feet in a straight line, and explodes again, repeating the effects above. The ember then returns to its new detonation point.

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** The Fire damage increases by 2d8 for each slot level above 7th.

#### Rays of Magic
*6th-level Evocation (Sorcerer, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (prism glass)
- **Duration:** 1 round

You conjure three random rays of magic and hurl them at targets within range. Roll three times on the table below to determine the types of rays created. You can direct all the rays at one target or distribute them among multiple targets. Each ray requires a separate spell attack roll.

| d8 | Magic | Effect |
|:--:|:-----|:------|
| 1 | **Fire** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 fire damage and starts Burning*, taking 2d8 Fire damage at the end of each of its turns until the condition ends. |
| 2 | **Beasts** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Piercing damage. You or another willing creature within 60 feet of you can use its reaction to move up to half its speed toward or away from the target, without provoking opportunity attacks. |
| 3 | **Metal** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Bludgeoning damage, and its speed is halved as its limbs become heavy until the end of your next turn. |
| 4 | **Light** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Radiant damage, sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius, can’t benefit from being Invisible, and attack rolls against it have advantage until the end of your next turn. |
| 5 | **Life** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Slashing damage and is either pushed or pulled 20 feet in a straight line (your choice, toward or away from you). |
| 6 | **Heavens** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Lightning damage. You can choose a second creature within 10 feet of the target to take the same damage. |
| 7 | **Shadows** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Cold damage and deals only half damage with weapon attacks until the start of your next turn. A creature immune to Cold damage is unaffected by this secondary effect. |
| 8 | **Death** | On a hit, the target takes 3d10 Necrotic damage, and you gain temporary hit points equal to the damage dealt. These temporary hit points last for 1 hour. |

***Using A Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You create one additional ray for slot level above 6.

#### Divine Judgment
*9th-level Divination (Cleric)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:**  Instantaneous

You call down divine judgment upon those around you. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. You gain insight into each creature's thoughts (if it has any), emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind—such as a fear, love, or hatred. You then choose for each creature to be subjected to one of the following effects:

**Guilty.**  The creature must make a Charisma saving throw (which it can choose to fail). On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 Radiant damage, falls Prone, and is Stunned until the start of your next turn. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing or carrying, except magic items, is reduced to a pile of fine salt.

If the creature is a Celestial, Elemental, Fey, or Fiend, it is instead banished to its plane of origin (if it is not already there) and cannot return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a *Wish* spell.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and suffers no other effects.

**Innocent.** The creature regains 8d6 hit points. In addition, it is cured of all diseases and any conditions causing it to be Blinded, Deafened, or Poisoned.

#### Path of Shadows 
*7th-level Conjuration (Bard, Sorcerer, Warlock, Wizard)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You summon swirling shadows to whisk away up to six willing creatures of your choice that you can see within range. Each creature is teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet of you, and must appear within 15 feet of at least one other teleported creature.

Upon arriving, each creature becomes Invisible until the end of your next turn and may immediately take the Hide action (no action required).

#### Summon Stampede
*9th-level Conjuration (Druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of cattle feed)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a stampede of creatures that manifest in an unoccupied space you can see within range. These creatures use the **Stampede** stat block. The stampede disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The stampede is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the stampede shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

*8th-level Transmutation (Druid)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a seed)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You cause a willing creature within range to tap into its primal essence, transforming into a colossal, bestial form. For the duration, the target gains the following benefits:

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You conjure an animated weapon infused with magical power. Choose Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage when you cast the spell. The weapon appears in an unoccupied space within range and lasts for the duration.

When the weapon appears, you may immediately make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 4d10 damage of the chosen type and suffers an additional effect based on the type selected:

* **Bludgeoning:** You can move the target up to 10 feet to an unoccupied space.

* **Piercing:** Treat any 1 or 2 rolled on the damage dice as a 3.

* **Slashing:** The target’s speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn.

Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your turns to move the weapon up to 20 feet to a space you can see and repeat the attack against the same or a different target within 5 feet.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.***  The damage increases by 1d10 for every slot level above 7.

#### Fissure
*6th-level Evocation (Druid)* 
___
- **Casting Time:** Action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot line)
- **Components:** V, S,
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You strike a non-magical surface, causing a fissure to erupt from you and split it down a line up to 60 feet long. The fissure opens up to 20 feet wide and 40 feet deep. If the ground is not deep enough to accommodate the fissure, the ground opens up to whatever lies beneath.  

A creature standing in the area of the fissure must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall Prone and into the fissure; any fall damage the creature takes is doubled from falling this way. Creatures that succeed on the save move to the edge of the fissure and may choose which side they move to. 

The fissure deals 50 Bludgeoning damage to any structure it comes in contact with when it appears. The fissure lasts indefinitely, and the ground within it is difficult terrain.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You can increase the length by 20 feet and its depth by 10 feet for each slot level above 6th.

#### Galvanic Bolts 
*5th-level Evocation (Sorcerer, Warlock)*
___

You conjure three bolts of lightning and hurl them at creatures within range. You can hurl them at one target within range or at several. Make a ranged spell attack for each. On a hit, the target takes 2d10 Lightning damage.

Hit or miss, invigorating lightning arcs from you and each target in a 5-foot radius. You, each target, and any creature within one or more of these 5-foot emanations must make a Constitution saving throw (creatures may choose to fail). 

On a failed save, a creature takes 4d6 Lightning damage and becomes Quickened* until the end of your next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and is not Quickened.

While Burning, the creature must make a Wisdom saving throw at the start of its turn. On a failed save, it becomes Frightened of you until the start of its next turn and must use its movement to flee from you by the safest available route. If there is nowhere to move, it drops Prone and uses its action to try to extinguish the flames.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** You create one additional ray for each spell slot level above 3.



#### Summon Swarm

___
- **Casting Time:** Action

You call forth a swarm of tiny creatures that manifest in an unoccupied space you can see within range. When you cast the spell, choose one of the following creatures: Bats, Birds, Insects, Rats, or Snakes. The creatures of the swarm resemble the chosen creature, and they use the swarm stat block for that creature (swarm stat blocks for the different creatures described below). The swarm disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The swarm is an ally to you and your companions. In combat, the swarm shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any, it takes the Dodge action and uses its move to avoid danger.

***Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.*** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block. Additionally, increase the swarm's size by one category for every two slot levels above 3rd level.

#### Unstable Discharge
